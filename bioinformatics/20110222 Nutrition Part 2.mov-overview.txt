The text discusses when and how to supplement patients with nutritional support before and after surgery. It highlights three main stages:

1. **Pre-Optimization:** This involves starting nutritional supplements 10 days to two weeks prior to an operation, particularly for malnourished patients or those undergoing major surgeries like a colectomy. The goal is to improve the patient's nutritional status before they reach the operating table.

2. **Intraoperative and Postoperative Supplementation:** Once surgery is underway or completed, more invasive methods such as enteral (tube feeding) or parenteral (intravenous) nutrition may be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks of complications like infections or organ perforation. Enteral feeding is preferred for its physiological benefits unless it's insufficient to meet caloric needs.

3. **Choosing and Managing Nutritional Support:**
   - **Indications for Tube Feeding:** Patients who cannot meet more than 60% of their daily caloric needs orally, such as those with major burns, swallowing difficulties from head injuries or strokes, or specific GI issues like low-output fistulas.
   - **Deciding on the Type of Feed and Timing:** For short-term (less than six weeks), nasogastric or nasojejunal tubes are suitable. Long-term needs may require more permanent solutions like stomas in different parts of the GIT.
   - **Managing Complications:** Various complications can arise from tube feeding, including mechanical issues (pressure necrosis, strictures) and metabolic problems (refeeding syndrome). It's crucial to monitor for these and manage them carefully.

Overall, early initiation, starting with small volumes, and gradually increasing based on patient tolerance is recommended. The approach must be tailored to the individual's specific needs and medical conditions.
