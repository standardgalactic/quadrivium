The text provides a step-by-step explanation of solving an exact differential equation. The given equation is:

\[ 2xy \, dx + (x^2 - 1) \, dy = 0. \]

### Key Steps in the Solution Process:

1. **Identify Exactness:**
   - Check if the differential equation is exact by verifying if:
     \[
     \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x},
     \]
     where \( M(x, y) = 2xy \) and \( N(x, y) = x^2 - 1 \).
   - Calculate the partial derivatives:
     \[
     \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = 2x \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 2x.
     \]
   - Since these are equal, the equation is exact.

2. **Find Potential Function \( f(x, y) \):**
   - Use \( M = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \), so integrate \( M \) with respect to \( x \):
     \[
     f(x, y) = \int 2xy \, dx = x^2y + g(y),
     \]
     where \( g(y) \) is a function of \( y \).

3. **Determine \( g(y) \):**
   - Use \( N = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \):
     \[
     \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2 + g'(y).
     \]
   - Set this equal to \( N \):
     \[
     x^2 + g'(y) = x^2 - 1.
     \]
   - Solve for \( g'(y) \):
     \[
     g'(y) = -1.
     \]
   - Integrate to find \( g(y) \):
     \[
     g(y) = -y + C.
     \]

4. **Formulate the Solution:**
   - The potential function is:
     \[
     f(x, y) = x^2y - y + C.
     \]
   - Since \( f(x, y) = \text{constant} \), express \( y \):
     \[
     x^2y - y = C_1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y(x^2 - 1) = C_1.
     \]
   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{C_1}{x^2 - 1}.
     \]

5. **Alternative Method: Separation of Variables:**
   - Rearrange the original equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{y} \, dy = -\frac{2x}{x^2 - 1} \, dx.
     \]
   - Integrate both sides:
     \[
     \ln |y| = -\ln |x^2 - 1| + C_2,
     \]
     leading to:
     \[
     y = \frac{C}{x^2 - 1},
     \]
     where \( C = e^{C_2} \).

The solution shows that the differential equation can be solved by recognizing its exactness and using integration, or alternatively by separating variables. Both methods lead to the same form of the solution for \( y \).

The text describes a mathematical process involving the natural logarithm and its relationship with an expression \( u \). It starts by stating that the natural log of the absolute value of \( u \) is equal to the negative natural log of the same, which simplifies to the natural log of the reciprocal of \( |u| \), plus a constant \( c \).

The equation is then exponentiated to remove the logarithm, resulting in an expression involving \( y \) and the absolute value of sine functions. A constant term emerges from the exponentiation process.

Next, it sets up an equation where \( u \) equals \( \frac{c}{x^2 - 1} \). By manipulating this equation, a new form is derived: \( x^2 - y = c \), which can be rewritten as \( z = f(x, y) = x^2y - y \).

The text then takes the differential of \( z \), resulting in \( dz = (2xy \, dx + (x^2 - 1) \, dy) \). This confirms that the original problem is solved correctly because differentiating the equation returns to an expression involving \( m \, dx + m \, dy \), showing consistency with the initial setup.

The conclusion emphasizes that this approach works as an exact differential equation due to the given conditions and verifies that the solution is correct by checking the differential of the function.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of solving the differential equation \(2xy \, dx + (x^2 - 1) \, dy = 0\). It begins by recognizing it as an exact equation because the partial derivatives satisfy the condition for exactness. The solution process involves finding a function \(f(x, y)\) whose total derivative equals zero, indicating that \(df/dx = 2xy\) and \(df/dy = x^2 - 1\). By integrating these expressions, one finds that:

\[ f(x, y) = x^2 y - y + g(y), \]

where \(g(y)\) is determined by setting the derivative with respect to \(y\) equal to \(x^2 - 1\), resulting in \(g(y) = -y + C_1\). This leads to:

\[ f(x, y) = x^2 y - y + C. \]

The constant \(C\) is determined by setting the equation equal to zero and solving for \(y\):

\[ x^2 - xy - y = C, \]

yielding the explicit solution:

\[ y = \frac{C}{x^2 - 1}. \]

Additionally, an alternative method using separation of variables is presented. By rearranging terms, the equation becomes separable:

\[ \frac{1}{y} \, dy = -\frac{2x}{x^2 - 1} \, dx. \]

Integrating both sides gives:

\[ \ln |y| = -\ln |x^2 - 1| + C_2, \]

which simplifies to the same form of solution for \(y\) in terms of \(x\).

The text describes a mathematical process involving logarithms and exponentiation. It starts with an equation: \(-\ln |u|\), which is rewritten as \(\ln |u|^{-1}\) plus a constant \(c\). Exponentiating both sides yields an expression for \(y\) in terms of \(u^{-1}\).

The text states that \(u = x^2 - 1\), so the equation becomes \(y = \frac{c}{x^2 - 1}\). It then expands to show that \(x^2 - y = c\), setting \(c = 0\) and defining a function \(z\) such that \(z = x^2y - y\).

The derivative of this function, \(dz\), is calculated: 
\[ dz = (2xy \, dx + (x^2 - 1) \, dy). \]

This confirms the original problem's conditions by showing that the differential equation \(m \, dx + m \, dy = 0\) holds true, as it simplifies to zero. The process verifies that the solution is consistent with the given derivatives and constants.

The text concludes by emphasizing that the differential \(dz\) aligns with the initial setup, regardless of whether a constant was used or not, confirming the correctness of the derived function.
