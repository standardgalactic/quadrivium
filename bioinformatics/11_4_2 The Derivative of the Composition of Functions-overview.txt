The text describes two methods to find the derivative of a function \( f \) with respect to time \( t \), where \( f \) depends on functions \( x(t) \), \( y(t) \), and \( z(t) \). 

**Method 1 (Chain Rule):**
- Compute the gradient of \( f \), denoted as \( \nabla f \).
- Evaluate the gradient at the vector function \( r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \).
- Differentiate the components of \( r(t) \) to get \( \frac{dr}{dt} \).
- Compute the dot product of \( \nabla f(r(t)) \) and \( \frac{dr}{dt} \).

**Method 2 (Direct Substitution):**
- Directly compute \( \frac{df}{dt} \) using the sum:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \cdot \frac{dx_i}{dt}
  \]
  where \( x_1 = x(t), x_2 = y(t), x_3 = z(t) \).

**Example:**
- Given \( r(t) = (\sin^2 t, \cos^2 t, t) \), compute:
  - \( \nabla f(r(t)) = (\cos^2 t + t, \sin^2 t + t, \cos^2 t + \sin^2 t) \).
  - \( \frac{dr}{dt} = (2\sin t \cos t, -2\sin t \cos t, 1) \).

- The derivative using Method 1:
  \[
  (\sin 2t)(\cos 2t + t) - (\sin 2t)(\sin 2t + t) + 1
  \]
  Evaluated at \( t = \frac{\pi}{2} \), results in 1.

- Method 2 involves the same steps but directly substitutes into:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \cdot \frac{dx_i}{dt}
  \]
  evaluated at \( t = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Both methods yield the same result, confirming consistency in derivative computation.

The text provides an explanation of two methods to find the derivative of a composition function \( f(\mathbf{r}(t)) \) where \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \). Here's a summary:

1. **Method 1: Chain Rule with Gradient**
   - Compute the gradient of \( f(x, y, z) \).
   - Substitute \( x(t), y(t), z(t) \) into this gradient.
   - Differentiate \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \) to find its derivative with respect to \( t \).
   - Take the dot product of the gradient and the derivative of \( \mathbf{r} \).

2. **Method 2: Direct Differentiation**
   - Express the composition as \( f(\mathbf{r}(t)) = f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \).
   - Use the chain rule to differentiate directly, summing up terms like \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \frac{dz}{dt} \).

The text illustrates both methods with examples, showing the steps involved in computing derivatives using either method. The examples involve trigonometric identities and differentiation techniques like the chain rule to simplify expressions.
