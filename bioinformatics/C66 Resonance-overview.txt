It looks like you're working through a problem involving resonance in a damped harmonic oscillator. Let's break down the situation:

1. **System Description**: You're dealing with a system subject to an external periodic force, described by a differential equation typical of forced oscillations. The solution involves both the homogeneous (free vibration) and particular solutions (forced response).

2. **Homogeneous Solution**: This part of the solution represents the natural behavior of the system without any external forces. It typically includes terms like \( e^{-\beta t} \sin(\omega_n t + \phi) \), where \( \beta \) is related to damping and \( \omega_n \) is the natural frequency.

3. **Particular Solution**: This represents the steady-state response of the system due to the external periodic force, often in the form \( A \sin(\gamma t - \delta) \), where \( \gamma \) is the driving frequency.

4. **Resonance Condition**: Resonance occurs when the driving frequency (\( \gamma \)) approaches the natural frequency (\( \omega_n \)). In an undamped system, this leads to unbounded growth in amplitude.

5. **Damping Effect**: The presence of damping modifies the resonance condition. Instead of infinite amplitude at exact resonance, the peak amplitude is finite and occurs near but not exactly at \( \gamma = \omega_n \).

6. **Mathematical Analysis**: You're using L'Hôpital's rule to evaluate the limit as \( \gamma \to \omega_n \) in the expression for the steady-state response. This involves differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to \( \gamma \) to resolve the indeterminate form.

7. **Final Expression**: After applying L'Hôpital's rule, you find an expression for the amplitude of oscillation at resonance, which is finite due to damping. The amplitude typically depends on factors like the driving force magnitude (\( f_0 \)), damping coefficient, and the difference between \( \gamma \) and \( \omega_n \).

In summary, your analysis shows how damping prevents infinite amplitudes at resonance and allows you to calculate a realistic peak response using calculus techniques. If you have specific questions about any part of this process or need further clarification on a step, feel free to ask!

The text describes a mathematical expression involving trigonometric functions of \(\omega t\) (angular frequency times time) where a term is divided by \(-2\omega^2\). It simplifies this to show how \(f_0/\omega^2\) affects the sine and cosine components, resulting in an expression for a function \(x(t)\).

The key point discussed is "pure resonance," which occurs when the damping factor (\(\gamma\)) approaches the natural frequency (\(\omega\)). In such a scenario, the amplitude of oscillations can theoretically grow indefinitely over time. However, it acknowledges that real-world systems experience some form of damping, preventing infinite growth.

Despite this damping, if driven hard enough without sufficient damping, the system's oscillation amplitude could surpass the limits imposed by structural forces, potentially leading to breakage or failure of the structure due to resonance effects.
