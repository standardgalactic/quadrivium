The text describes solving an initial value problem for a linear second-order homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The differential equation is given as:

\[ y'' - 4y' - 5y = 0 \]

with initial conditions \( y(1) = 0 \) and \( y'(1) = 2 \).

To solve this, the characteristic (auxiliary) equation is formed:

\[ m^2 - 4m - 5 = 0 \]

The roots of this quadratic equation are found to be \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = 5 \). Therefore, the general solution for \( y(x) \) is expressed as a linear combination of exponential functions:

\[ y(x) = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^{5x} \]

Using the initial conditions, these constants are determined. Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the general solution gives:

\[ 0 = c_1 e^{-1} + c_2 e^5 \]

For the derivative condition, differentiate \( y(x) \):

\[ y'(x) = -c_1 e^{-x} + 5c_2 e^{5x} \]

Substituting \( x = 1 \) into this expression gives:

\[ 2 = -c_1 e^{-1} + 5c_2 e^5 \]

Solving these two equations simultaneously yields the values of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). After substitution, it is found that:

\[ c_2 = \frac{e}{3} \]
\[ c_1 = -\frac{1}{3} e^6 \]

Thus, the particular solution to the initial value problem is:

\[ y(x) = -\frac{1}{3} e^{6-x} + \frac{e}{3} e^{5x} \]

This can be further simplified and rewritten if necessary.

The text describes a process of solving an equation and simplifying its components. Initially, two constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are identified as:

- \( c_1 = -\frac{1}{3}e^{-\frac{1}{3}} \)
- \( c_2 = \frac{1}{3}e^{-5} \)

These values are substituted into an original equation to express \( y \). The process involves several steps of simplification:

1. Substitution gives:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^{5x}
   \]

2. Plugging in the constants, it becomes:
   \[
   y = -\frac{1}{3}e^{\left(1-x\right)} + \frac{1}{3}e^{\left(5x-5\right)}
   \]

3. Further simplification leads to combining like terms and factoring out common factors, resulting in:
   \[
   y = -\frac{1}{3}e^{(1-x)} + \frac{1}{3}e^{5(x-1)}
   \]

4. The text continues with additional steps to rewrite the expression for clarity, involving rearranging exponents and factoring out terms to achieve a more simplified form:
   \[
   y = -\frac{1}{3}e^{(x-1)} + \frac{1}{3}e^{-(x-2)}
   \]

Throughout this process, the goal is to express \( y \) in its simplest form by manipulating and combining exponential terms.
