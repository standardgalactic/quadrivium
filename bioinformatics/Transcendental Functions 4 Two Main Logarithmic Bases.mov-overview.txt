The text discusses two primary types of logarithms: common logarithms and natural logarithms.

1. **Common Logarithm**: 
   - Often denoted as "log," it assumes a base of 10 unless otherwise specified.
   - For example, log 400 implies log base 10 of 400.

2. **Natural Logarithm**:
   - Used frequently in physics and has a special base known as Euler's number (e).
   - Denoted as "ln," representing the logarithm with base e.
   - ln 400 is equivalent to log base e of 400.
   - In physics, when people refer to "log" without specifying the base, they typically mean the natural logarithm. 

The text highlights these distinctions and notes that further exploration into Euler's number might be covered in future content.
