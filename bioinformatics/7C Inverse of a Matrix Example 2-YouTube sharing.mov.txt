To prove one of the other points we made in the introduction,
let's have a look and see if we can determine the inverse of this matrix.
It's 2 by 2, it's square, so certainly we can try.
Remember our first step was to get the determinant of matrix A,
which we could also write as this.
And the formula for that was AD minus BC.
And if we remember what A and D was, that was A, that was B, that was C, and that was D.
So A times D would be 3 times 2, 3 times 2,
and that should be negative, minus, and B times C, so 1 times 6, 1 times 6,
and that is going to be 6 minus 6, which is 0.
Now we know that the formula for the inverse was going to be 1 over the determinant of A.
Just remind ourselves what the rearrangement was,
and that was we're going to take the A and the D and swap their places,
so that would have been a 2 and that would have been a 3,
and we're going to take B and C and multiply negative 1 by each,
so that would be a negative 1 and that would be a negative 6.
but this is going to be 1 over 0, and we know that that is not defined.
Now we can say that matrix A is a singular matrix.
In other words, it does not have an inverse.
