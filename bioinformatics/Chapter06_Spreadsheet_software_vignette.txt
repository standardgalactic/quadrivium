In this lecture I just want to introduce you to spreadsheet software.
You might be familiar with it.
You'll see beautiful columns and rows of data.
It really makes it easy for you to collect your data.
It's not a very good tool to do your statistical analysis with,
but you can take that file and you can import it into Python
and then you can do some powerful stuff.
Have a look.
