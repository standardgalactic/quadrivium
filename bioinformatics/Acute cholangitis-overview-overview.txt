Acute cholangitis is an inflammation and infection of the biliary tree or bile ducts, often due to obstructions like gallstones. This condition can lead to obstructive jaundice, edema, inflammatory responses, bacterial overgrowth, and severe complications such as septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death if bacteria enter the bloodstream.

It primarily affects older adults with a higher prevalence in females but occurs across all ages and genders. Some patients may experience acute cholangitis as their initial symptom of biliary disease without previous biliary issues.

Diagnosis typically involves identifying "Charcot's triad" (pain, jaundice, fever) and more severe symptoms like delirium and hypotension in advanced cases. Diagnosis can be supported by ultrasound findings and lab tests indicating infection or inflammation.

Management requires urgent intravenous fluid resuscitation, blood cultures, and broad-spectrum antibiotics such as coamoxiclav according to local guidelines. The Tokyo Guidelines 2018 classify acute cholangitis into three severity grades:

- **Grade 1 (Mild):** Manageable with fluids and antibiotics; stones may pass.
- **Grade 2 (Moderate):** Consider patient age, bilirubin levels, among other criteria.
- **Grade 3 (Severe):** Requires aggressive treatment including fluid resuscitation and immediate biliary drainage. Transfer to a suitable facility is advised if necessary.

The guidelines emphasize structured approaches based on severity for effective management and referral processes.
