The text provides a detailed explanation of calculating energy consumption for a rechargeable battery and determining the discharge time for a car battery within an electrical circuit. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Energy Consumption Calculation:**
   - A 5-ampere current flows through a circuit with a 6-volt EMF rechargeable battery over 6 minutes (360 seconds).
   - The power is calculated using \( P = IV \), resulting in 30 watts.
   - Total energy consumed is found by multiplying power by time, yielding 10,800 joules or approximately 11 kilojoules.

2. **Car Battery Discharge Calculation:**
   - A car battery with a 12-volt EMF and an initial charge of 120 ampere-hours is analyzed.
   - To determine how long it can deliver energy at 100 watts:
     - The current \( I \) required for this power output is calculated as approximately 8.33 amperes using \( P = IV \).
     - Discharge time \( T \) is determined by converting the initial charge from ampere-hours to coulombs and dividing by the current.

The text underscores the importance of understanding power equations and unit conversions between time, current, and energy in these calculations.
