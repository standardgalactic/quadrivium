The text provides an explanation and application of the ratio test for determining the convergence or divergence of series. The ratio test examines the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity of the absolute value of consecutive terms in a series, denoted by \( L \). Specifically:

- If \( L < 1 \), the series converges absolutely.
- If \( L > 1 \) (including when it equals infinity), the series diverges.
- If \( L = 1 \), the test is inconclusive, and other methods must be used to determine convergence.

The text then applies this test to specific examples:

1. **Example Series**: The first example uses a series with terms given by \((-1)^k \cdot k / 2^k\). Applying the ratio test, it simplifies using limits and algebraic manipulation to find that \( L = 0.5 \), which is less than 1. Thus, this series converges absolutely.

2. **Factorial Series**: The second example involves a series with terms like \((k+1)! / e^{k+1}\). Applying the ratio test again and simplifying, it finds that \( L = \infty \), indicating divergence according to the ratio test.

Finally, the text introduces the root test as another method for assessing convergence. It functions similarly to the ratio test, where:

- If \( L < 1 \), the series converges absolutely.
- If \( L > 1 \) (including infinity), the series diverges.
- If \( L = 1 \), further tests are needed.

An example is proposed but not fully elaborated on, involving a series with terms raised to the power of \( k \). The simplification for such series using the root test makes the process straightforward. Overall, the text illustrates how these tests help in determining whether a series converges or diverges by examining specific limits.

The text analyzes the convergence of a sequence or series by examining the limit as \( K \) approaches infinity for the expression:

\[
\left( \frac{2K + 4}{|5K - 1|} \right)^K
\]

First, it simplifies the absolute value \( |5K - 1| \) to \( 5K - 1 \) since \( K \geq 1 \). The expression becomes:

\[
\left( \frac{2K + 4}{5K - 1} \right)^K
\]

By recognizing the form \( (\text{expression})^{1/K} \), it simplifies to evaluating:

\[
\lim_{K \to \infty} \frac{2K + 4}{5K - 1}
\]

This results in an indeterminate form of infinity over infinity. To resolve this, the text suggests dividing both the numerator and the denominator by \( K \), the highest power of the variable:

\[
\lim_{K \to \infty} \frac{2 + \frac{4}{K}}{5 - \frac{1}{K}}
\]

As \( K \) approaches infinity, \( \frac{4}{K} \) and \( \frac{1}{K} \) approach zero, simplifying the expression to:

\[
\frac{2}{5}
\]

Since \( \frac{2}{5} < 1 \), it concludes that the series converges absolutely.

The text explains the ratio test, an important tool for determining whether an infinite series converges or diverges. Here's a summary:

1. **Ratio Test Overview**:
   - The ratio test involves examining the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio between consecutive terms in a series.
   - If this limit, denoted as \( L \), is less than 1, the series converges absolutely.
   - If \( L \) is greater than 1 (or infinite), the series diverges.
   - If \( L = 1\), the test is inconclusive, and other tests are needed.

2. **Application to Series**:
   - A specific example is discussed where terms include powers of \( K \). The text demonstrates how to apply the ratio test by calculating limits of these ratios for given series.
   - In one example, a series involving \( (-1)^K \times K / 2^K \) converges absolutely because the limit from applying the ratio test is less than 1.

3. **Further Examples**:
   - Another series involving factorials and exponential terms is shown to diverge when the ratio test results in an infinite limit.
   
4. **Root Test Introduction**:
   - The root test, which is similar to the ratio test, uses the \( K \)-th root of the absolute value of the \( K \)-th term in a series.
   - Like the ratio test, if the limit (denoted as \( L \)) from the root test is less than 1, the series converges absolutely; greater than 1 indicates divergence. If \( L = 1\), other tests are necessary.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Both the ratio and root tests provide methods for analyzing the convergence of series by examining limits involving consecutive terms or roots of terms.
   - The text underscores that while these tests can be powerful, there are cases where additional methods must be employed if \( L = 1\).

The text describes the process of determining whether a given series converges. Specifically, it focuses on evaluating the limit as \( K \) approaches infinity for a ratio involving powers and expressions with \( K \). The key steps include:

1. Recognizing that the expression inside the limit can be simplified by considering powers of \( K \).
2. Simplifying the original complex expression into a more manageable form, particularly noting how certain terms cancel out.
3. Addressing an indeterminate form (\(\infty/\infty\)) by dividing both numerator and denominator by the highest power of \( K \) present in the denominator.
4. Evaluating the simplified limit as \( K \) approaches infinity, which results in a constant value (2/5).
5. Concluding that since 2/5 is less than 1, the series converges absolutely.

The overall conclusion from this analysis is that the given series converges.
