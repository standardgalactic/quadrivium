The text examines various types of convergence in infinite series, focusing on absolute and conditional convergence. An absolutely convergent series stays convergent even if all terms are replaced by their absolute values. If a series converges but not absolutely (i.e., the series of absolute values diverges), it is conditionally convergent.

Key examples illustrate these concepts:

1. **Alternating Series Example**: The series \(\sum (-1)^k / k\) converges via the Alternating Series Test, but its absolute form \(\sum 1/k\), known as the harmonic series, diverges. Thus, it is conditionally convergent.

2. **Harmonic Series**: The divergence of the harmonic series emphasizes why some alternating series are only conditionally convergent.

3. **Sine over Cubed Example**: For \(\sum \sin(k) / k^3\), despite oscillating terms, they are bounded by \(1/k^3\). Since \(\sum 1/k^3\) is a convergent p-series (with \(p = 3 > 1\)), the comparison test shows that \(\sum |\sin(k) / k^3|\) also converges, making this series absolutely convergent.

The text uses these examples to demonstrate how different tests assess series convergence.
