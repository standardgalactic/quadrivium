The text explains how to calculate the volume of a region in three-dimensional space bounded by two surfaces sharing a circular base defined by \(x^2 + y^2 = 2\). The lower surface is given by \(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2\) and lies below the xy-plane, while the upper surface is described by \(f(x, y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 2\).

To simplify calculations due to circular symmetry, polar coordinates are used: \(x = r \cos(\theta)\) and \(y = r \sin(\theta)\). The volume calculation is split into two parts:

1. **Volume above the xy-plane (Volume 1):** A double integral in polar coordinates is evaluated, resulting in a value of \(2\pi \left(-2\sqrt{2}/3 + 8/3\right)\).

2. **Volume below the xy-plane (Volume 2):** Another double integral yields \(2\pi\), but this volume is negative relative to the xy-plane, so its absolute value is considered.

The total volume is found by adding the absolute values of Volume 1 and Volume 2, resulting in \(\frac{2\pi}{3} (11 - 2\sqrt{2})\). The method demonstrates using polar coordinates to simplify integration over a circular base and employs techniques like u-substitution for evaluating integrals.
