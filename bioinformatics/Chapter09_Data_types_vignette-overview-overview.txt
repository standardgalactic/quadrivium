The lecture introduces two classification systems for differentiating data types: categorical vs. numerical and discrete vs. continuous. Categorical data pertains to categories or groups, whereas numerical data consists of numbers. Discrete data involves countable values, while continuous data encompasses measurements that can take any value within a range. Understanding these distinctions is essential as they determine the suitable statistical analyses for the data. Recognizing these types aids in choosing appropriate methods for analysis and interpretation.
