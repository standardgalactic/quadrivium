The provided text outlines how to use Python's SymPy library to solve polynomial inequalities and absolute value equations. Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the key points:

1. **Polynomial Inequalities**:
   - A polynomial inequality like \(x^2 - 4x > -3\) is transformed into \(x^2 - 4x + 3 > 0\).
   - SymPy's `Poly` object represents this polynomial in a domain of real numbers.
   - The function `solve_poly_inequality` finds solution intervals where the inequality holds true.
   - Verification involves substituting values within and outside these intervals to confirm they satisfy or do not satisfy the inequality. For example, checking \(x = 2\) (within) and \(x = 0\) or \(x = 4\) (outside).

2. **Absolute Value Equations**:
   - Solving equations like \(|x - 3| = 5\) using SymPy functions such as `solve` yields discrete solutions: \(x = -2\) and \(x = 8\).
   - Solutions are not always intervals but can be distinct values.

3. **Absolute Value Inequalities**:
   - For inequalities like \(|x - 3| < 5\), the solution is an interval \((-2, 8)\).
   - Verification involves substituting test values within and outside this interval to check if they satisfy the inequality.

4. **General Approach with SymPy**:
   - SymPy simplifies solving these problems by breaking down complex expressions into intervals or discrete solutions.
   - Users need to interpret results carefully, distinguishing between continuous intervals and individual solution points.

This approach demonstrates how SymPy can be used effectively for handling inequalities and equations involving polynomials and absolute values.
