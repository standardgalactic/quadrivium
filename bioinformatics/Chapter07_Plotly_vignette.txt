In this lecture, I want to introduce you to the wonderful world of Plotly.
Now, Plotly is an online web service.
You take your data in a spreadsheet or many other formats,
and you just import it into that web service,
and it can do the most beautiful, fantastic graphs and plots for you.
You can share that with your collaborators,
with friends and anyone who works with you on that data.
It really is a phenomenal tool.
Have a look.
