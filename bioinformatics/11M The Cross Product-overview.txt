The text provides an explanation and method for calculating the cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional space. The cross product of vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\), denoted as \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\), results in a new vector that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the original two vectors. This property makes the cross product particularly useful in physics for finding a vector normal (perpendicular) to a surface defined by other vectors.

To calculate the cross product, the text outlines a mnemonic involving determinants and cofactors:

1. Express \(\mathbf{u}\) as \((u_1, u_2, u_3)\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) as \((v_1, v_2, v_3)\).
2. Arrange these components into a 3x3 matrix with the unit vectors \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) in the first row:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   i & j & k \\
   u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
   v_1 & v_2 & v_3
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]
3. Calculate the determinant of this matrix using cofactor expansion along the first row:
   - The \(i\)-component is \(u_2v_3 - u_3v_2\).
   - The \(j\)-component is \(-(u_1v_3 - u_3v_1)\), noting the negative sign.
   - The \(k\)-component is \(u_1v_2 - u_2v_1\).

The resulting vector from this calculation, \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\), will have components:
\[ (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, -(u_1v_3 - u_3v_1), u_1v_2 - u_2v_1) \]

This vector is guaranteed to be perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\). This can be confirmed by taking the dot product of the resultant vector with either of the original vectors, which should yield zero if they are indeed perpendicular.

The text discusses how to calculate the cross product of vectors in two and three dimensions using matrices, without needing to memorize equations. It explains that this method is not applicable for vectors in four or more dimensions but covers most common problems encountered.

Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Matrix Method**: You can either memorize the equation or use a matrix approach, calculating determinants and cofactors with alternating signs, to find the cross product without rote memorization.

2. **Application to Two-Space Vectors**:
   - The method applies to vectors in two-space (or three-space).
   - For two-dimensional vectors represented as U1, U2 and V1, V2 (with no component along the third axis), the cross-product yields a vector perpendicular to the plane of these vectors.
   - This perpendicular vector will only have a magnitude in the K roof (z-axis) direction.

3. **Example**:
   - A practical example is provided where two vectors U and B are used to form a 3x3 matrix with unit vectors I, J, and K as headers.
   - The cross product is calculated using cofactors: 
     - For the I component, you close the row and column of I, resulting in a value based on the remaining elements.
     - Similar steps are taken for J and K components, considering the signs for cofactors.

4. **Result**:
   - The resultant vector from the cross product is perpendicular to both original vectors.
   - This is verified by taking the dot product of the resultant vector with each original vector (U and V), which results in zero, confirming perpendicularity.

The text emphasizes understanding and applying the matrix method for calculating cross products rather than memorizing formulas.

The text appears to be fragmented and somewhat unclear, making it difficult to provide a precise summary. However, based on what is presented:

- It seems to discuss Bolivia in relation to some unspecified "Hauts."
- There are references to something happening from the east during a second era or time period.
- Mention of an illustrator who is crying suggests emotional or artistic expression.
- A building activity that spans over six years is noted, possibly referring to construction projects involving cores.
- It mentions 200 programs sending answers to communities but states there's no plan.
- The speaker expresses a desire to continue despite humiliation and indicates they are passing by.

Overall, the text seems to cover themes of development, community interaction, and emotional challenges.
