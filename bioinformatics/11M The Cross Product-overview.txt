The text provides an explanation and method for calculating the cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional space. The cross product of vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\), denoted as \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\), results in a new vector that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the original two vectors. This property makes the cross product particularly useful in physics for finding a vector normal (perpendicular) to a surface defined by other vectors.

To calculate the cross product, the text outlines a mnemonic involving determinants and cofactors:

1. Express \(\mathbf{u}\) as \((u_1, u_2, u_3)\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) as \((v_1, v_2, v_3)\).
2. Arrange these components into a 3x3 matrix with the unit vectors \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) in the first row:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   i & j & k \\
   u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
   v_1 & v_2 & v_3
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]
3. Calculate the determinant of this matrix using cofactor expansion along the first row:
   - The \(i\)-component is \(u_2v_3 - u_3v_2\).
   - The \(j\)-component is \(-(u_1v_3 - u_3v_1)\), noting the negative sign.
   - The \(k\)-component is \(u_1v_2 - u_2v_1\).

The resulting vector from this calculation, \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\), will have components:
\[ (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, -(u_1v_3 - u_3v_1), u_1v_2 - u_2v_1) \]

This vector is guaranteed to be perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\). This can be confirmed by taking the dot product of the resultant vector with either of the original vectors, which should yield zero if they are indeed perpendicular.

The text discusses how to calculate the cross product of vectors in two and three dimensions using matrices, without needing to memorize equations. It explains that this method is not applicable for vectors in four or more dimensions but covers most common problems encountered.

Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Matrix Method**: You can either memorize the equation or use a matrix approach, calculating determinants and cofactors with alternating signs, to find the cross product without rote memorization.

2. **Application to Two-Space Vectors**:
   - The method applies to vectors in two-space (or three-space).
   - For two-dimensional vectors represented as U1, U2 and V1, V2 (with no component along the third axis), the cross-product yields a vector perpendicular to the plane of these vectors.
   - This perpendicular vector will only have a magnitude in the K roof (z-axis) direction.

3. **Example**:
   - A practical example is provided where two vectors U and B are used to form a 3x3 matrix with unit vectors I, J, and K as headers.
   - The cross product is calculated using cofactors: 
     - For the I component, you close the row and column of I, resulting in a value based on the remaining elements.
     - Similar steps are taken for J and K components, considering the signs for cofactors.

4. **Result**:
   - The resultant vector from the cross product is perpendicular to both original vectors.
   - This is verified by taking the dot product of the resultant vector with each original vector (U and V), which results in zero, confirming perpendicularity.

The text emphasizes understanding and applying the matrix method for calculating cross products rather than memorizing formulas.

The text appears to be fragmented and somewhat unclear, making it difficult to provide a precise summary. However, based on what is presented:

- It seems to discuss Bolivia in relation to some unspecified "Hauts."
- There are references to something happening from the east during a second era or time period.
- Mention of an illustrator who is crying suggests emotional or artistic expression.
- A building activity that spans over six years is noted, possibly referring to construction projects involving cores.
- It mentions 200 programs sending answers to communities but states there's no plan.
- The speaker expresses a desire to continue despite humiliation and indicates they are passing by.

Overall, the text seems to cover themes of development, community interaction, and emotional challenges.

The text explains the concept and calculation method for the cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional space. Unlike the dot product, which results in a scalar, the cross product yields another vector that is always perpendicular to the plane formed by the original two vectors. This property makes it useful in physics for finding vectors perpendicular to given planes.

To compute the cross product, you start with vectors \(\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)\) and \(\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3)\). The result of their cross product is calculated using a determinant method involving a matrix set up with unit vectors \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) on the first row. This process leads to the formula:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = (u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2)\mathbf{i} - (u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1)\mathbf{j} + (u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)\mathbf{k}
\]

In component form, this result is expressed as \((u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2, -(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1), u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)\).

The text emphasizes that the resulting vector from a cross product is always perpendicular to both original vectors. This orthogonality can be verified by taking the dot product of the resultant vector with either of the original vectors, which should yield zero, confirming they are perpendicular.

The text provides an explanation of how to calculate the cross product of two vectors in two- or three-dimensional space using matrix methods, specifically focusing on remembering cofactors and signs. It emphasizes that this technique is applicable only for vectors in 2D or 3D spaces and not higher dimensions.

Here's a breakdown of key points:

1. **Matrix Method**: To calculate the cross product without memorization, use a 3x3 matrix involving unit vectors \( \mathbf{i} \), \( \mathbf{j} \), \( \mathbf{k} \) in the first row and components of the two vectors in subsequent rows.

2. **Cofactors**: Remembering the signs for cofactors (positive, negative, positive) is crucial when expanding the determinant to find each component of the cross product vector.

3. **Cross Product Components**:
   - For \( \mathbf{i} \) direction: The result comes from eliminating the row and column with \( \mathbf{i} \).
   - For \( \mathbf{j} \) direction: Use a negative sign for elimination.
   - For \( \mathbf{k} \) direction: Compute the determinant of the 2x2 matrix formed by excluding the \( \mathbf{k} \)-related row and column.

4. **Perpendicularity**: The resulting vector from the cross product is perpendicular to both input vectors, implying it lies in the plane defined by them if extended to three dimensions.

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - An example of two specific vectors is given.
   - Calculate each component using cofactors and signs.
   - Resulting in a vector with components \( (2, -7, -6) \).
   - Verify perpendicularity via dot products, confirming the resultant vector is orthogonal to both input vectors.

The text also hints at an application context or metaphor involving vectors' spatial relationships but remains primarily instructional about calculating cross products.

The text appears fragmented and lacks coherence, making it difficult to derive a clear summary. However, some discernible elements include:

1. **Context**: It seems related to Bolivia and possibly an event or situation involving communities.
2. **Illustrations/Communication**: There is mention of someone becoming an "illustrator crying," which might refer to using illustrations or images to express emotions or messages.
3. **Construction and Development**: References to a building project or construction that spans over several years, specifically mentioning cores.
4. **Community Interaction**: A place exists with 200 programs aimed at engaging communities.
5. **Planning and Continuation**: There's an implication of ongoing activity despite the absence of a formal plan.

Overall, it touches on themes of development, community engagement, and emotional expression in Bolivia but lacks clarity due to its fragmented nature.
