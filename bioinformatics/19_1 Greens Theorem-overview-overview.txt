Green's Theorem establishes a relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve \( C \) and a double integral over the region \( R \) enclosed by \( C \). Here are the key points:

1. **Statement**: For a positively oriented (anticlockwise), piecewise smooth, simple closed curve \( C \) enclosing a region \( R \), Green's Theorem transforms a line integral of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} = (m, n) \) into a double integral:
   \[
   \oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \right) dA
   \]

2. **Conditions**: The curve \( C \) must be closed, piecewise smooth, simple (non-intersecting), and anticlockwise oriented. The vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) should be smooth over the region.

3. **Line Integral Expression**: The line integral of a vector field is expressed as \( \oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) \).

4. **Curl Representation**: The curl of the vector field \( \mathbf{F} = (m, n) \) is represented by \( \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \), which appears in the double integral.

5. **Non-conservative Fields**: The vector field does not need to be conservative, meaning the line integral around a closed path is not necessarily zero.

6. **Applications**: Green's Theorem simplifies complex line integrals by converting them into easier double integrals over regions, making it useful for solving problems involving vector fields and plane region integrals.

The theorem is particularly helpful when conditions are met, allowing for straightforward calculations in vector field analysis.
