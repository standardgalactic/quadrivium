The text outlines several rules for definite integration:

1. **Order of Integration**: Swapping the limits of integration results in the negative of the integral's value.

2. **Zero Width Interval**: An integral over an interval where both limits are the same (e.g., from A to A) is zero because there is no width to calculate area under a curve.

3. **Constant Multiple Rule**: A constant factor can be factored out of the integral, placed in front of it.

4. **Sum and Difference Rule**: The integral of a sum or difference of functions equals the sum or difference of their integrals.

5. **Additivity Rule**: For the same function integrated over consecutive intervals (A to B, then B to C), the total integral from A to C is the sum of the integrals over each sub-interval.

6. **Domination Rule**: If one function dominates another on an interval (i.e., it lies above or equals it everywhere on that interval), its integral will be greater than or equal to the other's integral over the same range.

7. **Maximum and Minimum Inequalities**: The area under a curve from A to B is bounded by the product of the minimum function value in [A, B] times the length of the interval and the maximum function value in [A, B] times the length of the interval.

An example with the function \(\sqrt{1 + \cos(x)}\) on the interval from 0 to 1 illustrates these rules, demonstrating that the actual integral lies between two bounds formed by rectangles using the minimum and maximum values over the interval.

The text outlines several rules for definite integration that are essential to understand:

1. **Order of Integration**: Swapping the limits of integration results in the negative of the original integral.

2. **Zero Width Interval**: An integral over an interval with zero width (e.g., from A to A) is zero, as there's no area under the curve.

3. **Constant Multiple Rule**: A constant factor can be taken outside the integral.

4. **Sum and Difference Rule**: Integrals of sums or differences of functions can be separated into individual integrals.

5. **Additivity Rule**: The integral from A to C can be split into the sum of integrals from A to B and B to C for the same function.

6. **Domination**: If one function is greater than or equal to another over an interval, its integral will also be greater or equal over that interval.

7. **Maximum and Minimum Inequalities**: The area under a curve on an interval is bounded by the product of the interval length and the minimum value of the function, and similarly for the maximum value.

An example with \( f(x) = \sqrt{1 + \cos x} \) over [0, 1] illustrates these rules. Evaluating at endpoints gives approximate values: \(\sqrt{2}\) at \(x=0\) and \(\sqrt{1.5}\) at \(x=1\). The area under the curve lies between these bounds, demonstrating how maximum and minimum inequalities provide upper and lower limits for integration over an interval.
