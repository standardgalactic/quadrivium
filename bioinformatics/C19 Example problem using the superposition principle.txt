Now let's move on to this sine function. We note that sine and cosine would be one of these.
First let's just do the complementary part of the general solution.
So we're going to make this homogeneous by setting the g of x e equal to 0
and we're going to use the auxiliary function method, if I can call it that.
We're going to have m squared minus m plus 1 equals 0
and immediately we're going to see there's nothing that you can square minus something plus 1
that's really going to get you 0 in as much as this is going to be a complex conjugate.
In other words, m is going to be 1 plus minus, so that's negative b and b is negative 1.
The square root of negative 1 squared which is 1 minus 4 times 1 times 1 is 4
divided by 2
all divided by 2 times a and that is 2
So we're going to have the fact that m is going to equal 1 plus minus the square root of 3i
i being the square root of negative 1
divided by 2
In other words, m sub 1 is going to be a half
plus square root of 3 over 2i
and m sub 2 is going to be a half minus
square root of 3 over 2i
In other words, alpha equals a half
The real part, the imaginary part for beta is going to be the square root of 3 over 2
In other words, y sub c, our complementary function is going to be c sub 1
Oh, that's not
Apologies for that
It's going to be e to the power alpha x
e to the power alpha x is e to the power 1 half x
times c sub 1 cosine of square root of 3 over 2x
plus c sub 2 sine of square root of 3 over 2x
being the beta beta constants
Now for the complementary form
Now we note that our g of x is equal to 2 times the sine of 3x
So we've got to suppose what y of p is going to be
And you will note that it's no use just to say it's going to be a sine of 3x
Because the derivative of this is going to be a cosine
and the derivative of that is going to be a sine again
So it's best to always use a cosine of 3x
plus b times the sine of 3x
to use both sine and cosine
So now you're going to get that this y sub p the particular solution here is
its first derivative is going to be negative 3 a sine of 3x
plus what are we going to have here 3b cosine of 3x
and y sub p prime prime is going to equal negative 9 a cosine of 3x
and this is going to be negative 9b sine of 3x
and we've got to set that equal to substitute this back in here
and set it equal to the right hand side
Note though that we can also say it's plus 0 times the cosine of 3x
I can add this to the right hand side
I'm not changing the equation in any form because I'm multiplying by 0
So I'm going to add that
and again you're going to have this a equal to this
this function with a equal to this
and the function of b equal to to that
and you'll be able to solve
So let's just substitute in there
So we're going to have negative 9 a cosine of 3x
negative 9b sine of 3x
negative y prime so minus this which is then positive 3a sine of 3x
minus 3b cosine of 3x
and lastly we're going to have
lastly we're going to have
I think the battery might die if it does I'll just stop and add the recording
plus y so it's plus a times cosine 3x plus b sine 3x
is that is going to equal this 2 times the sine of 3x plus 0 times the cosine of 3x
so I can get all the cosine 3x's together
and what is that going to be it's going to be a negative 9a that's gone
plus 3a
so that's what am I doing negative 3b
negative 3b
minus 3b
minus 3b for that one
and plus
is that just plus a plus a so for that and then for the for the sines we're going to have a negative 9b
as far as that one's concerned a positive 3a for that one
and that one was gone a positive b for that one
that's going to equal 2 times the sine of 3x plus 0 times the cosine of 3x
so we're going to have here minus 8a
minus 3b
for this one's going to equal 2
in other words
minus 8a is going to equal to
where are we that's going to equal
I don't know where the battery died
so I've just grouped the cosine of 3x's and the sine of 3x's together on this side
apologies for that
I'm going to set that equal to 2 and then equal to 0 so
this was equal to 0 in other words a is going to equal negative 3 over 8b
and on this side I'm going to have that negative
is that 7 let's just have a look
let's just see if I've got this right negative 9b plus 3a plus b so that is going to be a negative
8b plus 3 times a but a is negative 3 over 8b that is going to equal 2 so negative 8b
negative 9 over 8b equals 2 so if I put them both on 8 that is going to be
6 minus 64 minus 9 that's negative
73b equals 2 in other words b is going to equal negative 16 over 73 which leaves a equaling negative
3 over 3 over 8 times b which is negative 16 over 73 which is uh 2 times 3 is 6 over 73
in other words y sub p is going to equal what is that 6 over 73 cosine of 3x minus 16 over 73 sine of
3x that's 3x that's 3x that's only that in other words y is going to equal e to the power 1 half x
times c sub 1 cosine of square root of 3 over 2x plus c sub 2 sine of square root of 3 over 2x
plus 6 over 73 cosine of 3x minus 16 over 73 sine of 3x so I'll just put the complementary and the particular
functions together by adding them and that gives me the general solution so important here is to note
that the form in which we are going to do that we are going to do our substitution in as far as the
particular solution is concerned is both in cosine and sine form not just not just the sine and then
we set this extra zero we set set this extra zero as far as the cosine is concerned so that we have
both of them on both sides of the equation
