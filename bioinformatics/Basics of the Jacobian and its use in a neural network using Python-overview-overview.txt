The text provides an overview of using Python's SymPy library for symbolic mathematics, particularly focusing on partial derivatives and the construction of the Jacobian matrix, both in multivariable calculus and neural networks.

### Key Points:

1. **Introduction to SymPy**:
   - The tutorial uses a Google Colab notebook with SymPy (version 1.7.1) to explore mathematical concepts.
   - SymPy facilitates symbolic computation for deriving expressions like partial derivatives and Jacobians.

2. **Partial Derivatives and Jacobian Matrix in Multivariable Calculus**:
   - The text explains computing single-variable and multivariable function derivatives with SymPy.
   - A Jacobian matrix is introduced as a 2x2 matrix containing partial derivatives of vector-valued functions, formed by differentiating each component of the output vectors with respect to input variables.

3. **Application in Neural Networks**:
   - The tutorial describes a simple neural network structure consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers (with outputs \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \)), and an output node \( O \).
   - It explains how matrix notation is used to represent weights (\( W^1 \), \( W^2 \)) and biases (\( C \)).
   - The Jacobian matrix is utilized to understand how changes in input affect the network's outputs, facilitating optimization and analysis.

4. **Detailed Neural Network Analysis**:
   - For each layer, the text outlines forming expressions using weight matrices and bias terms.
   - It explains calculating the Jacobian for the first hidden layer as \( [W_1, W_2] \) and describes more complex computations in subsequent layers.
   - The output layer involves another set of weights (\( W^3 \)) and a scalar output \( O \).

5. **Overall Change Calculation**:
   - The text concludes by showing how the overall change in network output relative to input is determined by multiplying Jacobians from different layers, resulting in a scalar that quantifies this relationship.

This tutorial demonstrates practical applications of mathematical concepts like partial derivatives and Jacobian matrices in computational contexts such as neural networks, highlighting their importance for understanding and optimizing model behavior.
