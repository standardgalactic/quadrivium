The text explains how to find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix by first calculating its determinant using the formula \(\text{AD} - \text{BC}\). For the given matrix:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \]

the determinant is calculated as \(3 \times 4 - 0 \times 0 = 12\), not zero. Therefore, the matrix does have an inverse and is non-singular. The text also mentions a rule that if a matrix has an entire column or row of zeros, it will be singular and lack an inverse. However, this condition doesn't apply to the given matrix since neither column nor row is entirely zero.
