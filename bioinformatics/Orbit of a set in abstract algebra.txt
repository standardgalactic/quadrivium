In this video I want to start looking at some more interesting aspects of group actions
and we're going to start looking at the orbit stabilizer theorem
and there are two words in there, orbit and stabilizer
so let's start looking at the orbit of a set
so we're going to imagine that we have two things
we're going to have a group G
it's going to have a set
I like writing that as G set these days
and some group action
and we're going to have a set A
just a set of elements
and what we're going to take is
we're going to take a specific A
which is an element of A
and we're going to allow all the elements in this set
to act upon this A
so that's going to give us this thing called the orbit of A
the orbit of A
and that is a set G dot A
such that G is an element of G set
so what you can think of
you take all the elements of G
all of them one after the other
you act it on this one specific A
and that will give you a new set
and that set is called the orbit of A
first thing that we'll notice is really that
A is an element of the orbit of A
why is that so?
well we know that the identity element of the set G
set is one of the elements in the set
and if we act on A
we are just going to get A
so we know that A is an element
A is really an element of the set
so that is one thing we can look at
just to see what goes inside of this set
the next thing we want to look at is
if we take this set
all the G's acting on A
and we take any one, any arbitrary element of that
we've seen A is already in there
but we take any arbitrary element of that
let's take G dot A
so that G dot A is an element of the orbit of A
as simple as that
we just take any arbitrary one of them
what we are suggesting is that
the set that we get from doing this
from taking one of these elements
as our new element
as our new element
so we just take this as a new element of that orbit
that we're going to get exactly the same orbit back
we're going to get exactly the same orbit back
and how do we know that
well just imagine that we take G dot A
what we say the definition is
so now we're going to say that
G A that's an element
let's call this of G A
so G A is an element of the orbit of G A
and let, what can we do
let's take G star this time
and we act on G dot A
so what we are saying is
this is exactly the same as our initial definition
of the orbit of a set
we take all the elements G
so this is going to be a new set
and this time we just call it G star
just to make sure that we're not talking necessarily
about the same G
as an element of G set
in other words
we are going to run through again
all the elements of G set
the set from my
and we're going to act upon this
one element
arbitrary element
that came originally from
the orbit of A
so I should actually just say that
it is part of the orbit of A
let's just do that
the orbit of A
and we're going to call this
the orbit of G A
because I'm taking a new element
and remember that element
is just another element of my set here
and I'm doing this whole orbit thing again
now by the properties of group action
I can rewrite this as G star
and composed with G
that's the binary operation of that
acting on A
that's what I can do
but by the properties
of a group
this is just another element of G
this is just another element of G
so this writing this
is nothing other than
just rewriting this
because I'm taking all the elements of G
and I'm running all of them
and I'm acting on A
all of them
and I'm acting on A
because this is just
under the column of G
in my Cayley's table
of group operations
so by Cayley's theorem
I'm just running through all of those again
so I'm running through all of those
acting on A
running through all of G set
acting on A
and this is exactly
so this is OGA
is this
the set
such that
this
this is all elements of G set
so I'm running through all of them again
and what am I left with?
I'm left with the orbit of A
because that is exactly the same thing
so those are exactly the same thing
so I can take
from the start
take an element of A
all the elements in G set act on that
that gives me a new set
and I'm saying this specific set
which is very unique
because it comes from A
is I'm going to
create a set
and I can take any one of those
as a new element
I'm going to take
then a new
it as a new element
and I'm going to let
G
all the elements in G
act on all of them again
and I'm going to land up
with exactly the same orbit
I'm going to end up
exactly the same orbit
so that's very interesting
the other thing that we really need to note
is the fact that
that
this orbit of A
is a partition
it's a partition
on A
so it takes A
and it partitions it
well
what it might do
is it might just be
equal to A
that's just a trivial one
but let's imagine
that it's not trivial
and that there's another
specific orbit
and we're going to take
an element B
element of A
so that we create
the orbit of B
remember that's going to be
G dot B
and we run through
all the elements of G set
we run through all of them
and what we are suggesting
is
that
we can have these two be
disjoint
so that if I have this element here
and
it is
it's not part of that
you know
if we can show that
then it is disjoint
so that we have this
that O A
the intersection with O B
that that is an empty set
they are disjoint
how would we prove that
how would we prove that
now
let's just
to the contrary
have this
G dot A
and we set that
equal to G dot B
and we're going to make this
G star
let's make this
G star
so that we know
it's not necessarily
that we start off
with the same element
it's just we run through
we run through all of them
so
let's say
they are not disjoint
so that
you know
that these two
I can find
an element
in the orbit of A
and that's going to be
equal to some element
in the G
in the orbit of B
imagine then
that that would mean
that they are not
they are not disjoint
but
let's
act on the left hand side
by G star's
inverse
dot G dot A
and
it's completely
legitimate to do
and I'm going to
G star
dot B
by the properties
you know what we can do
so this is going to be
G star's
inverse
composed with G
dot A
and this is going to be
G star's
inverse
composed with G star
and that acts on B
we know from the properties
of the group
that that would be
the identity element
so we just have B
on this side
and what do we have
on this side
well
we're just running
through all the elements
by the Cayley's table
4G
we're just running
through a whole one
by Cayley's
by Cayley's theorem
that means
I'm running through
all of them
and what do I have
I have nothing
other than
G dot A here
G dot A
element
of the orbit
of A
so now
B
is an element
of the orbit
of A
so
if
this was so
then
it means
it is originally
part of
this
orbit of A
it's originally
part of this
orbit of A
showing that
if it is not
part of the orbit
of A
then we have
two disjoint
then they are disjoint
showing clearly
that
that
if I
if I do
create an orbit
say
it is part of
it is
one of the
partitions
of my set A
so
in summary
a couple of
beautiful things
we know the
definition of an orbit
we take a specific one
we know that
A itself
will be an element
of that orbit
we also know that
if I take
any one of the
elements in that orbit
and I try to create
a new orbit
through that
it's just going to be
exactly the same
as the original orbit
and that these orbits
they really partition
they partition a set
they partition the set
in these disjoint
in these disjoint sets
so that is the orbit
in the next video
we're going to look at
what the stabilizer is
the stabilizer
and that's for the next video
it's the target
so that is the
the explicizer
it's the ipod
the see
is this
the stabilizer
and that the
it clouds
and that it
and this isope
it's the
the
the
