Let's have a look at this matrix, 2 by 2, so it's square, so we can certainly try and get the inverse of this matrix.
First of all we're going to get the determinant of A, and we know that it's AD minus BC, so in this instance it's going to be 3 times 0, which is 0, minus 0 times 4, which is 0, and that equals 0.
And we now already know that if the determinant is 0, that matrix does not have an inverse, so also here matrix A is singular.
So we can make a new rule, we perhaps can look out that if there's a whole column of 0s, automatically that matrix is going to be singular.
