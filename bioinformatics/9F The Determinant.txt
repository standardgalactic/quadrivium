I really try and make as many of these lectures on the determinant as is possible because the
determinant is so important and but it's so easy to get confused with the determinant specifically
in some textbooks where you'll find a string of statements like this and it says if A is a
square matrix of a matrix of size n by n now remember you can only get the determinant of
a square matrix to start off so if you're dealing with an augmented matrix there's no determinant
involved okay and then it says that all these statements how many do we have one two three
four five six seven statements one two three four five six seven are all equivalent so if
one is true then all the others are true and it can get slightly it can get slightly confusing
so let's first of all just put this into context what am i dealing with i'm dealing with a
two things i can only look at a square matrix and that exists as something all on its own
but here because we are looking at forms like this ax equals b ax equals b it also means that i'm talking
about the format where i take a linear equation say for instance three equations and three unknowns
and i create two three matrix matrices from it the matrix a the matrix of coefficients so for instance
that is going to be uh a one one a one uh row one couple two a one three and we go all the way down
to a three three then i have this matrix x that is my unknowns x y and z or x1 x2 x3 and i say that equals
some matrix b which is my solution b1 b2 and b3 so this is what what we are dealing with in other words
i can rewrite this i can say this one times x plus this one times y plus this one times z equals b1
now this one times x this one times y this one times z equals b2 so i've got my three linear equations
there so what we're dealing with here now is just this a square matrix so either a matrix just on its
own or as part of this linear system so if i make my first statement and i say a is invertible
so if a was a two by two matrix for instance i'm not talking about something like three four six and two
the determinant of that matrix is zero three times four is 12 minus six times two is 12 that's zero
okay that matrix has no determinant and i know the inverse is one over the determinant of a times the
adjoint of a okay so that matrix will not be invertible but i'm so i'm choosing one that is invertible
so that is one of my seven statements there that means all the other statements here are equivalent
they refer to they are all and true or if a was not invertible then they all false but let's take it
it is invertible that means ax equals zero has only the trivial solution now what does trivial solution mean
that means my all my b values here are zero zero zero they are all zero for two two two by two matrix a
here that will be zero zero here it'll be zero zero zero in other words i have this modulus system where
all my answers on the right hand side are all equal to zero and that only has if i write it like this
if these are all zeros then i can only have the trivial solution
okay but in brackets i want to put here that means the determinant does not equal zero
so if i have a modular system in other words ax equals zero all those are zero on the side
that means and it is an invertible matrix meaning the determinant does not equal zero then i can only have
the trivial solution if the determinant was equal to zero was equal to zero then i'm dealing with something
then i am dealing with something else so here we are just stating it will only have the trivial solution
because i said it's invertible in other words i'm saying the synonym to saying it's invertible is saying
that the determinant does not equal does not equal zero okay the reduced row echelon form of a is the identity matrix
matrix it is the identity matrix and you might say are you sure i have an invertible matrix now let's make
one let's make three six three six two and instead of four we'll have another two
so the determinant is now going to be six minus 12 is negative six so let's do let's take it to row echelon four
so i'm going to divide everything by three there so i'm going to have one three two two i need to get
rid of this two so i'm going to multiply this first line by by a negative two for instance now i look
i do this negative multiplication and just adding but you are supposed to do positive multiplication
and then subtracting but it works out to be the same thing so i'm going to have a negative two
and the negative six now i need to add it to this negative two plus two negative two and two is zero
two and negative six is negative four i can multiply out that second row by negative a quarter
zero times negative a quarter is zero zero times negative four times negative a quarter equals one
so i'm left to one and three is zero one for my new matrix now that i can multiply this by negative
three the second row so i'm going to get zero and negative three i can add that to the first row one
plus zero is one three plus negative three is zero zero one i don't know if the video comes out there in
the bottom but do it for yourself you can just see i'm left to the identity matrix one zero zero one
so if it is invertible my determinant isn't zero and i can row reduce it to row a reduced row echelon form
gauss-join elimination will always be the identity matrix no matter what you do
