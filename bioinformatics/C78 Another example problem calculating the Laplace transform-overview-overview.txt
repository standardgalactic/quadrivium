The text describes finding the Laplace transform of \( \sin(2t) \) using integration by parts. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Setup**: The Laplace transform is defined as an integral from 0 to infinity of \( e^{-st} \sin(2t) \, dt \).

2. **Integration by Parts**:
   - First application: Choose \( u = \sin(2t) \), \( dv = e^{-st} \, dt \); resulting in \( du = 2\cos(2t) \, dt \) and \( v = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \).
   - This leads to an expression involving \( \cos(2t) \).

3. **Second Integration by Parts**:
   - Repeat with \( u = \cos(2t) \), \( dv = e^{-st} \, dt \); resulting in \( du = -2\sin(2t) \, dt \) and \( v = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \).

4. **Simplification**:
   - The original integral reappears with a factor after two applications of integration by parts.
   - Solve for the integral in terms of itself.

5. **Boundary Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate boundary terms at \( t = 0 \) and \( t = \infty \).
   - Terms involving \( e^{-st} \) tend to zero as \( t \to \infty \) if \( s > 0 \).

6. **Final Result**:
   - The Laplace transform is found to be \( \frac{2}{s^2 + 4} \), matching the standard form for \(\sin(at)\).

The process involves careful integration by parts, limit evaluation, and expression manipulation to ensure convergence with \( s > 0 \).
