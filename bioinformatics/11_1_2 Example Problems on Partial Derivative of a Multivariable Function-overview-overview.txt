The text explains how to find the first partial derivative of a piecewise function with respect to \( x \). The function has two expressions: 

1. For points \((x, y) \neq (0, 0)\), the function is defined as \( \frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2} \).
2. At the origin \((x, y) = (0, 0)\), the function equals 0.

To find the partial derivative with respect to \( x \) for \((x, y) \neq (0, 0)\), we apply the quotient rule:

- Let \( u = xy \), so \( u' = y \).
- Let \( v = x^2 + y^2 \), so \( v' = 2x \).

The derivative using the quotient rule is:
\[ \frac{(y)(x^2 + y^2) - (xy)(2x)}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = \frac{y^3 - x^2y}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}. \]

At the origin \((0, 0)\), since the function is constant (0), its partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is also 0. This can be confirmed by evaluating the limit of the difference quotient as \( h \to 0 \).

In summary, the partial derivative with respect to \( x \) for the entire function is:
- For \((x, y) \neq (0, 0)\), it is \(\frac{y^3 - x^2y}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}\).
- At \((x, y) = (0, 0)\), it is 0.
