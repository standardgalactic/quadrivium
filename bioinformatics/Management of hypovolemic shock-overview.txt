Management of hypovolemic shock involves several critical steps:

1. **Immediate Control**: Quickly manage external hemorrhage and plan for inaccessible bleeding or plasma loss.

2. **Volume Resuscitation**:
   - Aim to restore normal blood pressure while considering permissive hypotension to prevent dislodging thrombi.
   - In severe cases, aggressive resuscitation is necessary despite risks.
   - Use two large (16 gauge or larger) peripheral intravenous catheters for rapid fluid administration. Avoid long, thin central lines and femoral veins due to infection and thrombosis risks.

3. **Fluid Considerations**:
   - Prefer balanced salt solutions like Ringer's lactate over 0.9% saline to avoid worsening metabolic acidosis.
   - Administer 2-3 liters within 10-30 minutes, equivalent to 3-4 times the blood volume loss.

4. **Monitoring and Assessment**:
   - Monitor mental state, blood pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure, skin color, and urine output to assess resuscitation adequacy.
   - If no response is observed, consider ongoing losses or other shock types.

5. **Use of Blood Products**: May be necessary in hemorrhagic shock.

6. **Technical Precautions**:
   - Ensure catheters are free from kinks, secure them well, and check frequently.
   - Replace femoral lines promptly if used to reduce infection risk.

These steps aim to stabilize the patient by restoring adequate circulation and preventing complications during resuscitation.
