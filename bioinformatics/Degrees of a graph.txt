Good, let's very quickly talk about the degrees of a node.
Degrees of a node or a graph.
Now, remember if we had a complete graph,
so what was a complete graph?
That there is a connection between all of these nodes,
all of these vertices.
Now, the degree of this vertex here
is the number of edges that are incident upon it.
So it's 1, 2, 3.
So the degrees of this one is 3,
the degrees of this one is also 3,
this one is 3, and this one is 3.
So they all are 3.
And that's actually another special type of graph
that we call a regular graph.
In a regular graph,
all the nodes have similar degree.
All of the nodes, all of the vertices,
have a similar number of edges incident upon them.
Now, the total degrees of,
you can talk about a graph's total degrees,
that's where we'll just add up
all of the degrees of these nodes.
As I said, there's a special one, regular.
And I want to show you all of this in Mathematica.
One more thing, though,
and that is a loop.
A loop counts as 2.
So now, the degree of this node here
would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
So a loop counts as 2.
So we're not going to work much with loops,
but for now, just remember,
if you get that kind of question,
don't make that little mistake.
I think a loop really counts for 2.
It's incident,
the 2 edge is incident upon the loop,
as far as that's concerned.
So let's go to Mathematica,
and we're going to look at the degrees,
and we're going to look at some regular graphs.
So let's have a look at this concept of degrees.
Let's just do,
let's just create a graph G
as a computer variable,
and I'm going to make it a complete graph.
Let's go to the complete graph
that we had before with 10,
with 10 nodes.
There we go.
Beautiful.
Let's look at the vertex degree.
So there's this function,
vertex degree,
and let's query what graph G was all about.
And we see that all 10 of these vertices
had a degree of 9.
All of them had a degree of 9.
And that's, you know, simple.
You can go count them,
but it makes obvious sense.
Now we can also say total.
So I'm just going to sum up,
because remember,
this is just a list of 10 elements.
So let's do a total
that will just sum all the elements,
numerical elements,
in a list.
So I'm going to say total vertex degree,
and I'm going to use graph G again.
Close my square brackets twice,
and it adds all of them up, 90.
Now, note something here,
that the number of degrees of the vertices,
they are twice the number of edges.
Twice the number of edges.
This is really known, I think,
as the handshaking lemma,
because each edge has two vertices
attached to them.
Because there is this thing
called the edge count.
Let's have a look at that edge count.
If I do edge count of G,
it's going to give me
how many edges there are.
So if you were to go count all of these,
they're 45.
They're 45,
and then really,
the total of the vertex degree,
if I add all of them up,
vertex degree,
whoops,
vertex,
vertex degree
of G,
and that is really,
we can ask,
is that equal to two times,
two space,
instead of multiplication,
the edge count,
the edge count of G,
and lo and behold,
of course,
it's going to be true.
So that's the hand-shaking lemma
that we see in action there.
So let's just have a look
at the regular graph,
and that is where,
just have a look at a few,
play with a few of them.
That is where all the nodes
are going to have
the same degree.
So let's just create a graph,
and you tell me.
So I'm going to say graph,
and let's make a list of the nodes.
First,
one,
two,
three,
and four.
There's my vertices,
and let's connect them.
It's an undirected,
so I'm going to connect these nodes,
one undirected edge to two,
and let's make three undirected edge
and four,
so they are all connected,
and let's have vertex labels.
I always like vertex labels,
vertex labels,
and give their name to the screen.
There we go.
So let's have a look at this.
Four has degree one,
three has degree one,
two has degree one,
one has degree one.
All of them have degree of one.
That is a regular,
that is an absolutely regular graph.
Let me show you another one
that's an absolute regular graph
that you might not think about.
So let's have a graph.
Let's just make a list
only of the edges.
So what about one and one?
They are connected.
What about,
makes them make it two and three,
and let's make it three and two.
There we go.
Let's put in vertex labels,
vertex labels,
and the name of those,
and there we go.
Look at this.
One has an edge count of two.
Remember I told you a loop is two?
Two has an edge count of two.
Three has an edge count of two.
So all three nodes have an edge count of two.
This makes this a very easy,
regular graph.
So there we go.
Regular graphs and the degree of graphs.
