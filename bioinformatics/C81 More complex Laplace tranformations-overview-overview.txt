The text outlines an efficient method for finding the Laplace transform of a function \( f(t) \) multiplied by an exponential term \( e^{at} \). The key idea is to use operational properties that allow you to modify the existing Laplace transform of \( f(t) \) rather than starting from scratch. Specifically, multiplying \( f(t) \) by \( e^{at} \) corresponds to substituting every instance of \( s \) in the Laplace transform of \( f(t) \) with \( s-a \). 

For example, if you need to find the Laplace transform of \( e^{3t} \cdot t^3 \), and you know that the Laplace transform of \( t^3 \) is \( \frac{6}{s^4} \), you can use this property. By replacing \( s \) with \( s-3 \), the resulting Laplace transform becomes \( \frac{6}{(s-3)^4} \). This method simplifies calculations by avoiding complex integration, using a straightforward substitution instead.
