The text describes a process for expanding a rational function where the numerator's degree (11) is lower than that of the denominator (12), which makes partial fraction decomposition suitable. It outlines specific steps using an example:

1. Confirm that partial fraction decomposition applies due to the degree difference.
2. Expand terms from a repeated linear factor, \( (x + 2)^4 \), into partial fractions: 
   - \( \frac{a_1}{x+2} \)
   - \( \frac{a_2}{(x+2)^2} \)
   - \( \frac{a_3}{(x+2)^3} \)
   - \( \frac{a_4}{(x+2)^4} \)

3. For a quadratic factor, \( x^2 + 2x + 3 \), use the form:
   - \( \frac{b_0x + c_0}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \)

4. Expand terms from a repeated irreducible quadratic factor, \( (x^2 + 4)^3 \), into partial fractions:
   - \( \frac{b_1x + c_1}{(x^2+4)} \)
   - \( \frac{b_2x + c_2}{(x^2+4)^2} \)
   - \( \frac{b_3x + c_3}{(x^2+4)^3} \)

The objective is to simplify the rational function into these components, facilitating easier integration or analysis. The video emphasizes understanding and applying partial fraction decomposition techniques for polynomial expressions in fractional form.
