The text outlines the process of solving a differential equation with both transient and steady-state components, specifically in the context of an initial value problem. The function \( f(t) \) on the right-hand side is periodic, leading to two parts: a transient solution that decays over time and a steady-state solution that persists.

### Steps:

1. **Transient Solution**:
   - The differential equation is transformed into its auxiliary form.
   - Solving the characteristic equation gives complex roots, indicating oscillatory behavior.
   - The transient solution involves an exponential decay term \( e^{-t} \) multiplied by sinusoidal functions (cosine and sine), which eventually approach zero as time \( t \) approaches infinity.

2. **Steady-State Solution**:
   - Assumed to be a linear combination of cosine and sine terms.
   - Substituted into the differential equation to find coefficients that satisfy the periodic forcing function.
   - The steady-state solution is determined to be proportional to \( 2\sin(t) \).

3. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Given: \( x(0) = 0 \) and \( x'(0) = x_1 \).
   - Using these, constants in the transient solution are solved.
   - The constant \( c_1 \) is found to be zero due to initial conditions.
   - The constant \( c_2 \) is determined as \( x_1 - 2 \).

4. **Complete Solution**:
   - Combines both transient and steady-state solutions.
   - Transient term: \( e^{-t}(c_2 \sin(t)) \), which decays to zero.
   - Steady-state term: \( 2\sin(t) \).
   - The final solution is expressed as:
     \[
     x(t) = e^{-t}(x_1 - 2)\sin(t) + 2\sin(t)
     \]

This solution captures both the initial transient behavior and the long-term periodic response of the system.
