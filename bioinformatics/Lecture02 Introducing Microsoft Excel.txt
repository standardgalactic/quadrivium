and here we have Microsoft Excel 2011 version for the Mac looks a bit different from the Windows
version and we'll try and discuss both of these comes as part of Microsoft Office so if you have
Word installed many people are familiar with Word you'll probably also have Excel it's a
spreadsheet package and many people are not familiar with this but it is so useful and
actually so easy to learn I'm not going to go through everything and teach you Excel but as
we start doing the statistics one or two things will become familiar to you as we start using it
you'll get familiar with the use of Microsoft Excel so as with most software packages we'll
have this menu bar at the top and every time I click on one of these a different part of what
is called the ribbon opens and this ribbon has various parts to it if I look there that'll
be table options table styles cells so there's these various little sections under each of these
tabs so they are charts the chart ribbon opens and under charts I'll have insert chart and some of the
options there I'll have insert sparklines and some of the options there it's just that a way Microsoft
I went what didn't want to say invent but what they use instead of just these drill down menus everything
I find here I can just go to the menus up top the old-fashioned style of things that we used to now this
is just a different way of getting to everything that is available more neatly grouped and set out it
actually works quite well so most of the time it'll be in the home menu there you'll have your edit block
there which is copy and paste sort of thing font menu if you want to change the size and top of your font the
color the color of the blocks alignments many of these things will be quite the same as it is in Microsoft Word
most importantly though we come down to these cells it's a grid pattern arranged in rows and columns so here down
we'll see one two three four five so this one refers to if I click on it actually it highlights this whole
row row one row two row three and at the top columns column a column B column C see if I hover over that a
little downward facing arrow appears and I can actually click on it and I'll highlight that whole column
which means by row and column well here it's actually by column in a row I can give an address to each of these
little cells so if I click there that would be cell A1 if I click there it will be cell D6 so every cell has an
address and it is this ability to give an address to all your data that makes spreadsheet software so powerful
how do I enter data will I simply just start typing say for instance I have two groups of patients that I want to do some research on
I'll simply start typing group A in the one now if I hit enter now I just typed as I would in Microsoft Word
and I typed right there in the cell but once I've clicked on a cell I can also enter things in this little bar here
it's exactly the same thing and I can accept it or reject it by this green little icon here or this red icon can cancel
whatever I've typed in there or while I'm in there I can just hit the enter key now look if I hit enter
I jump to the next cell down now I can just either click in the cell next door or if I was there I can just use the
arrow keys on my keyboard one to the right and one up and now I'm there and I start typing group B
instead of typing it there I'll type it here so it remembers that I'm still on B1
and if I type here group B and accept it there it'll stay on there so for instance let's say for argument's sake
we're dealing with white blood cell count so I'm going to start typing in all my group A patients
they were admitted patient number one at an HP a white cell count of 13 comma 1 drop down now be very careful
with this commas and full stops it depends how your Mac is set up if it's standard out the box
it'll use commas when it wants to delineate integer values to the left and decimals to the right 13 being
the integer comma 1 the decimal you can set up your Mac differently in your preferences pane panel and
you can set it to full stop and Microsoft Windows versions of Excel it will automatically use the full
stop there be very very careful mine is still out the box so it still has the comma next patient had a
white cell count of 13 comma 4 14 comma 4 let's make it now remember if I hit enter I was going to jump
one cell down but right then then I can use the right arrow key and it'll jump to the cell across from
there so after typing in whatever you want you can just move the arrow key to the side where you want to
go next there's some other shortcuts as well holding in shift or control or command there's all sorts of
different ones let's say under group B I had 14 comma 1 and down arrow 15 comma 9 oops now look at this what
to do now simply going to hit backspace and I'm going to click back in that cell now I'll have to retype
the whole thing 15 comma 9 but what if it was 14 comma 9 I want to go back and change that 5 to a 4 if I hit the
backspace now or I'm going to jump to that cell instead of the normal word document where I'll just move
inside of what I was typing to the left so let's move back there you have to either make the correction
up here so if I clicked in there and said back arrow back arrow back arrow I was going to get to that 5
okay that's one way the other way is if I go into the cell and I hold down the control key on the
Mac and U now I've entered what is called edit mode now if I use the back arrows and the forward arrows I
move inside of there to make my change and I'll say backspace 4 and if I now hit enter it'll accept that so you
have to hit control and U while in a cell to use your arrow keys to in to to move around if I did not
hit control and U and I use my arrow keys I jump between the cells now on windows that's different
different you simply hit the F2 key at the top of your keyboard F2 and you enter edit mode not so on the
Mac you have to hit control U now let's just move there let's type in another value 12 comma 1 and we'll have
10 comma 5 and then yeah we'll just type in 16 comma 1 you see definitely group 2 what's the group of the
higher values let's have 13 comma 6 right now what about our very first statistical analysis we want to do
and that is usually to get the mean otherwise known as the average so I have four values there what can I do
how can I add them very quickly now they're different ways and this is the power of spreadsheet software I can
simply do calculations called formulas by starting things off with the equal sign so I'm in a cell there and I'm
going to write equal now I could type in 13 comma 1 plus 14 comma 4 plus 12 comma 1 plus 10 comma 5 the
whole thing that's oh takes so long what if I had my equal sign there the cell is still highlighted but I move up
and I click in the cell and look it says a 2 so lo and behold it now says plus a 2 and I say plus and I click on the
next one that's a 3 plus I click in the next one that's a 4 and I'm just hitting the plus on my keyboard shift and
equal which is plus and I click on that one and now if I hit enter it's added up all of them for me
it's added them all up for me let's go back in there and you see here in this function bar it says
equals a 2 plus a 3 plus a 4 plus a 5 those are the addresses of those cells remember the addresses of the
of these cells but what if I wanted to get the average well there's four values there so I'll just sum them up and
divide it by four so how would I do that well I'm in that cell again I'm going to hit control U to enter edit mode
remember now I can use my arrow keys so remember the order of arithmetic operations so I'll have to put going to the
front and to the back and putting parenthesis around it so that that gets executed first and then divide by
four boom and there we have the average of those four values is 12.525 now I want to show you a bit of magic
if you clicked on that cell and you see there's a little block at the bottom there if I hover my mouse cursor
right there and I hold it in I don't let go and I drag it across and the cell next to it highlights and
then I let go lo and behold I get another value there if I go into that value look what it says at the top
or if I enter control U I go into edit mode look what it did it now has B2 B3 B4 and B5 and nicely
color coded so you can see what it refers to so you can see I'm adding all of this in parenthesis so that
happens first then divide by four so I'm actually getting the average of that I didn't type anything
now just to get out of there I'm just going to hit the escape bar the escape key I should say
escape means you leave the edit mode and everything is done so how did this work it's called
referencing these cells and it's what it's doing is it's not saying the A2 A3 A4 A5 what it's doing
behind the scenes it's saying go one two three four five six blocks up and then go one two three four five
four five blocks up and then go one two three four up that's what it does it does not keep in its memory
the actual values A2 A3 A4 it's just a reference to relatively relative to where this formula gets executed
relative to that relative addressing it's so many blocks away from that so when I drag this across
this new cell still said so many blocks above so many cells above so many cells above so many cells above
so it was a relative to where we are now now we're here we're not there anymore we're now here relative
to this one so many blocks up would now be B2 and B3 and B4 and B5 so that's beautiful instead of having
to retype stuff if I've used addressing like this relative it's this relative to the cell if I now move
things across so see that change and then moved it across it will do the same thing as it had before
it will copy it but the relative referencing the relative address relative to this one up so many cells
now it will do exactly the same thing so that is called a formula actually type in A2 plus A3 plus A4 plus A5
divided by four now let me introduce you to functions I can type in equals and there are hundreds of these
functions now look at this I'm going to type average A-V-E-R-A-G-E and it actually popped up there so I can
actually double click on it I needn't but let's do that because it's a nice little tool tip you'll see there's
all sorts of other ones but that's the one I want I double click on average now I should not have done that
double click and just a single click would have sufficed and it says to me here a little tool tip number one number two
so what I can actually do is while I'm in between those two parentheses there I click on that first
cell and hold it in and drag it down now look at that it now says average A2 colon A5 it is a magical word
I'm using a keyword to do a certain function I'm going to average all of those values if I hit enter now
lo and behold exactly the same thing 12.525 isn't that magic now making use of a relative cell references
I'm going to click on there go to that little block in the corner my arrow changes I hold it in hold the mouse click
in drag it across to where I want it let go and let's click away and let's get back there and look at that
average b2 colon b5 it just means b2 to b5 that's that whole lot there if I go back there and hit ctrl u to
go to edit mode you'll see b2 b5 is colored in that is what it is averaging on so that's beautiful instead
of having to do everything I can type in a keyword and there are hundreds of keywords and a lot of statistical keywords
for me just to do that another important one is just count let's practice with that equals count I needn't do uppercase
I can do lowercase so start counting start writing count oh there it is I'm just going to do one click on it and
immediately it puts both parentheses there for me and I'm also just going to go highlight all of those I clicked on the first one and
dragged let go hit enter and it counts four there were four values again across to this side there were four values
this is the beauty and power of statistical analysis you can well imagine now how you could type in all the values of the
that you want to do your research on and how you can do statistical analysis and all of that you can already do average
so this was an introduction to spreadsheet software and just by doing a few simple things I hope you've already become
familiar with at least some of the aspects of spreadsheet software
now there is a little bonus video in this playlist bonus a one actually two versions of it you can watch it
watch the one with the stat plus video attached to it it actually says so in the name of the video and in it I'll just
discuss the p-value and show you a little bit of the statistical analysis that you can do on two columns of data here
so for instance with group A and group B and how to be quickly develop a p-value from there but that's a bonus
it jumps ahead of time but it's also a nice video to give you an intuition as to what the p-value really is
I'm jumping the gun completely but if you have some time watch that video
