In this section we are going to look at the relationship or the equivalence of mass and energy.
Let's write that. Equivalence of mass and energy.
And we all know E equals MC squared, but it's obviously a bit more complicated than that.
We're going to have the total energy of an object, any mass, total energy of any mass, energy and mass,
is going to equal the rest energy, which we'll denote as E0, plus the kinetic energy.
So if it's standing still, there will obviously be no kinetic energy,
and we'll be able to work out relative visited kinetic energy,
although we don't refer to it as that, that is the true kinetic energy of an object.
That is going to be the total energy minus the rest energy.
And the equations that you should know here is that the rest energy, E0 equals MC squared.
Okay, that's E0 equals MC squared.
And then the total energy.
The total energy of an object equals MC squared divided by, you guessed it, 1 minus V squared over C squared.
So if we're just looking at kinetic energy, if we just look at kinetic energy, that is going to be MC squared divided by the square root of 1 minus V squared over C squared,
so usually it is written as MC squared, taken out as a common factor, and then 1 over the square root of 1 minus V squared over C squared minus 1.
That is a bit different than half equals MC, kinetic energy equals M V squared.
A bit different than that as you can, as you'll appreciate there.
And this takes into consideration what V squared is.
As you can get from this equation to that, if you make V very small and you do binomial expansion of this factor in the denominator there,
you'll see that after a second term or so, it really gets small and you're left with about half, left with about half M V squared.
So, equation for rest energy of an object, and we'll see what enormous amount of energy is locked up in mass.
And this equation for the total energy that mass has, the total energy, and that total energy incorporates any type of kinetic energy,
and there's our equation for kinetic energy.
As promised, let's have a look at how much energy is locked up in mass, even rest mass.
So this golf ball is not moving, it's sustaining, and it has that mass open up for 6 kilograms.
And I want to know how long we can power a light bulb running, let's rate it at 75 watt.
First, we must remember what the equation is for rest mass.
The energy involved is MC squared, so that's going to be 0.046 kilograms.
It seems as if we are using two significant digits, so that is going to be multiplied by 3.0 times 10 to the power 8 meters per second squared.
And that gives me a less mass. Let's see what my calculation came out to me.
I just want to see where I put it.
4.14, 4.14 times 10 to the power 15 Joule.
Now, you can imagine that is an enormous amount of power.
If we just look at power, power equals energy divided by time.
In other words, time equals energy divided by power.
So I have that much energy, 4.14 times 10 to the power 15 Joule.
And I'm divided by the power that I require, which is 35 Joules per second or what.
Those will cancel, those go into the numerator.
And I get, now you're going to get 5.52 times 10 to the power 13 seconds.
And if you convert that to years, that is 1.7 million years.
The energy locked up in a golf ball at best can power a light bulb for 1.7 million years.
And that is, that's fantastic. You can't, you can't deny it. That's phenomenal.
Now let's look at something more realistic.
As much as there's no way without technology that we can get all that energy out of a golf ball.
But we have an electron with a mass of, to four significant digits there, 9.109 times 10 to the power.
That's 31 kilograms.
That electron is at rest.
Now the electron is not at rest.
It goes around and around and moves around, but it's at rest.
It's at rest.
It's at rest.
And then we accelerate it to a final speed of 0.995, 0.9995 C.
I want you to know first of all, what is its rest energy?
Now we know rest energy is just going to equal MC squared.
And if I put in that mass in C squared, my answer comes to 8.187 times 10 to the power of negative 14 joules.
And we want this answer in electron volts.
Remember, one electron volt equals 1.602.
If we go to four significant digits times 10 to the power of negative 19 joules.
So those will go and I get an answer in electron volts.
And let's put it in mega electron volts, I get 0.5111 mega electron volts.
Half a mega electron volt.
That is the rest energy of an electron.
Now second of all, what is its total energy at this velocity?
And we know an equation for total energy.
That is going to be MC squared divided by the square root of 1 minus V squared over C squared.
And the answer for that.
And the answer for that equals.
Let's see where I write this now.
Look at this.
2.589 times 10 to the power of negative 12 joules.
Certainly a lot more two orders of magnitude and more than that.
And if I put this into electron volts with the same method of changing the units.
Same conversion.
I get 16.16 mega electron volt.
And see certainly there, that is a lot more.
What is the kinetic energy then?
Well the member kinetic energy equals total energy minus rest energy.
Total energy minus rest energy.
Or we can just use that equation that we have done before.
But you can just subtract these two from each other.
You can get 15.65 mega electron volt.
That is the kinetic energy now of that electron.
In 3.66.

That is the inner crew.
