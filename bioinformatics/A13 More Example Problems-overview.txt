The text provides an example of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 3x3 matrix \( A \). The matrix \( C = A - \lambda I \) is constructed, where \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues. The goal is to find values of \( \lambda \) such that the determinant of \( C \) equals zero.

The process involves calculating the determinant using a chosen row or column for expansion—here, the first column was selected. This led to a characteristic polynomial equation: 

\[ -\lambda^3 + 5\lambda^2 - 8\lambda + 4 = 0. \]

Factoring this polynomial revealed the eigenvalues:
- \( \lambda_1 = 1 \)
- \( \lambda_2 = 2 \) (repeated, thus a repeated eigenvalue)

The discussion then turns to finding eigenvectors for these eigenvalues. For \( \lambda = 2 \), the system of equations derived from \( A - 2I \) is solved to determine whether there are one or multiple linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to this eigenvalue.

This process is typical in linear algebra when analyzing the properties of matrices, such as diagonalizability and stability. The presence of repeated eigenvalues requires careful examination of the associated eigenspace dimension (i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenvectors) to determine if there are enough vectors to fully span that space.

The text discusses solving a system of linear equations and finding eigenvectors associated with an eigenvalue problem. It presents calculations where subtracting 2 from 1 results in -1, and this is used in further computations involving variables \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\). The text explains that these values must satisfy a specific condition, indicating they are equal.

The focus then shifts to the eigenvalue problem for a matrix \(A\) with an eigenvalue \(\lambda = 1\). It calculates \(A - \lambda I\) and simplifies it into a system of equations. By setting up different conditions (\(k_2 = 0, k_3 = 1\) and vice versa), two distinct eigenvectors are found: \([1, 0]^T\) and \([0, 1]^T\).

For the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 2\), a similar process is followed, leading to another equation system. Here, it deduces that \(k_1 = k_2 = k_3\), resulting in an eigenvector of \([1, 1, 1]^T\).

Finally, the text combines these findings into a general solution for the differential equation involving exponential terms with time \(t\) and coefficients from the eigenvectors. The solution is expressed as a sum of terms like \(k_1 e^{2t}\), where \(k_1\) corresponds to the eigenvector \([1, 1, 0]^T\).

The text describes solving a mathematical problem involving an expression with exponential terms, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Initially, there are distinct components represented by terms like \( e^{2t} \), along with constants (\( k_3 \)) and repeated in expressions such as \( e^t \). The problem involves using basic mathematics skills, including polynomial long division, to factor a third-order polynomial.

The presence of repeat eigenvalues is noted, which could complicate the solution process. However, this situation provided two distinct eigenvectors, allowing for a straightforward resolution without needing to resort to complex equations. Ultimately, despite the complexity involved in the steps, the outcome is a simple answer. The exercise highlights revisiting foundational math concepts and techniques to reach this result.

The text describes the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a given \(3 \times 3\) matrix, labeled as matrix \(A\). The approach involves creating a new matrix \(C = A - \lambda I\), where \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue and \(I\) is the identity matrix. The goal is to find values of \(\lambda\) for which the determinant of \(C\) equals zero.

Here's a summary of the steps taken:

1. **Matrix Setup**: Matrix \(C\) is constructed as:
   \[
   C = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   3 - \lambda & -1 & -1 \\
   1 & 1 - \lambda & -1 \\
   1 & 1 & 1 - \lambda
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. **Determinant Calculation**: The determinant of matrix \(C\) is calculated by expanding along the first column, leading to:
   \[
   (3-\lambda) \left((1-\lambda)^2 + 1\right) + 1(1 - (1-\lambda)) - 1(-1)
   \]
   Simplifying this expression results in a cubic polynomial equation for \(\lambda\).

3. **Polynomial Factorization**: The cubic polynomial derived from the determinant is factored to find its roots:
   \[
   -\lambda^3 + 3\lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 4 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 2)^2
   \]

4. **Eigenvalues**: The roots of this polynomial give the eigenvalues: \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = 2\). This indicates that there is one distinct eigenvalue (\(\lambda = 1\)) and a repeated eigenvalue (\(\lambda = 2\)).

5. **Eigenvectors**: The text suggests proceeding to find eigenvectors for each eigenvalue, starting with \(\lambda = 2\), to determine if there are single or multiple independent eigenvectors associated with the repeated eigenvalue.

This process highlights typical steps in linear algebra for determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors, emphasizing polynomial factorization and determinant calculation.

The text discusses solving an eigenvalue problem related to a system of differential equations. Here’s a summary:

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The discussion begins with finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a matrix associated with the differential equation.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - For \(\lambda = 1\), the matrix simplifies to specific values, leading to equations involving \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\).
   - It's determined that \(k_1 = k_2 = k_3\) is a solution, resulting in an eigenvector of \([1, 1, 1]\).

3. **Distinct Eigenvectors**:
   - By setting different conditions (e.g., one variable to 1 and another to 0), distinct eigenvectors are identified.
   - For example, when \(\lambda = 2\), the resulting eigenvector is \([1, 0]\).

4. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution to the differential equation is constructed using these eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
   - It involves exponential terms \(e^{\lambda t}\) multiplied by their corresponding eigenvectors.

Overall, the text outlines a methodical approach to solving for eigenvalues and eigenvectors and constructing the general solution of a system of linear differential equations.

The text describes a mathematical exercise involving solving for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, focusing on dealing with distinct and repeated eigenvalues. The process requires using basic mathematics skills like polynomial long division to factor a third-order polynomial. In this particular case, there were repeated eigenvalues, but they resulted in two distinct eigenvectors, simplifying the solution and avoiding complex calculations. Ultimately, despite the detailed steps required, the final answer is straightforward and simple.
