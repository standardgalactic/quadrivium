The text provides an example of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 3x3 matrix \( A \). The matrix \( C = A - \lambda I \) is constructed, where \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues. The goal is to find values of \( \lambda \) such that the determinant of \( C \) equals zero.

The process involves calculating the determinant using a chosen row or column for expansionâ€”here, the first column was selected. This led to a characteristic polynomial equation: 

\[ -\lambda^3 + 5\lambda^2 - 8\lambda + 4 = 0. \]

Factoring this polynomial revealed the eigenvalues:
- \( \lambda_1 = 1 \)
- \( \lambda_2 = 2 \) (repeated, thus a repeated eigenvalue)

The discussion then turns to finding eigenvectors for these eigenvalues. For \( \lambda = 2 \), the system of equations derived from \( A - 2I \) is solved to determine whether there are one or multiple linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to this eigenvalue.

This process is typical in linear algebra when analyzing the properties of matrices, such as diagonalizability and stability. The presence of repeated eigenvalues requires careful examination of the associated eigenspace dimension (i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenvectors) to determine if there are enough vectors to fully span that space.

The text discusses solving a system of linear equations and finding eigenvectors associated with an eigenvalue problem. It presents calculations where subtracting 2 from 1 results in -1, and this is used in further computations involving variables \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\). The text explains that these values must satisfy a specific condition, indicating they are equal.

The focus then shifts to the eigenvalue problem for a matrix \(A\) with an eigenvalue \(\lambda = 1\). It calculates \(A - \lambda I\) and simplifies it into a system of equations. By setting up different conditions (\(k_2 = 0, k_3 = 1\) and vice versa), two distinct eigenvectors are found: \([1, 0]^T\) and \([0, 1]^T\).

For the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 2\), a similar process is followed, leading to another equation system. Here, it deduces that \(k_1 = k_2 = k_3\), resulting in an eigenvector of \([1, 1, 1]^T\).

Finally, the text combines these findings into a general solution for the differential equation involving exponential terms with time \(t\) and coefficients from the eigenvectors. The solution is expressed as a sum of terms like \(k_1 e^{2t}\), where \(k_1\) corresponds to the eigenvector \([1, 1, 0]^T\).

The text describes solving a mathematical problem involving an expression with exponential terms, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Initially, there are distinct components represented by terms like \( e^{2t} \), along with constants (\( k_3 \)) and repeated in expressions such as \( e^t \). The problem involves using basic mathematics skills, including polynomial long division, to factor a third-order polynomial.

The presence of repeat eigenvalues is noted, which could complicate the solution process. However, this situation provided two distinct eigenvectors, allowing for a straightforward resolution without needing to resort to complex equations. Ultimately, despite the complexity involved in the steps, the outcome is a simple answer. The exercise highlights revisiting foundational math concepts and techniques to reach this result.
