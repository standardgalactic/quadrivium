The text explains the process of determining whether a given 2x2 square matrix has an inverse. The key steps include calculating the determinant using the formula \(AD - BC\). For this specific matrix, where \(A = 3\), \(B = 1\), \(C = 6\), and \(D = 2\), the determinant is calculated as \(3 \times 2 - 1 \times 6 = 0\). Since the determinant is zero, the formula for finding the inverse, which involves dividing by the determinant, results in division by zero. This means the matrix does not have an inverse and is therefore classified as a singular matrix.

The text explains how to determine if a given 2x2 matrix has an inverse. To find the inverse, one first calculates the determinant using the formula \(AD - BC\). For the provided matrix elements (A=3, B=1, C=6, D=2), the determinant is calculated as \(3 \times 2 - 1 \times 6 = 0\). Since the determinant is zero, the inverse of the matrix does not exist because division by zero is undefined. Thus, the matrix is classified as singular, meaning it lacks an inverse.
