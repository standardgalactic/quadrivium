The text explains the process of determining whether a given 2x2 square matrix has an inverse. The key steps include calculating the determinant using the formula \(AD - BC\). For this specific matrix, where \(A = 3\), \(B = 1\), \(C = 6\), and \(D = 2\), the determinant is calculated as \(3 \times 2 - 1 \times 6 = 0\). Since the determinant is zero, the formula for finding the inverse, which involves dividing by the determinant, results in division by zero. This means the matrix does not have an inverse and is therefore classified as a singular matrix.
