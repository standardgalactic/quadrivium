In this new series of the Here for Jooste Academic Programme, we ask some of our medical
officers or registrars to come tell us a bit more about various review articles.
Patients present with a variety of presentations and symptoms, but broadly they are characterised
by presence of abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel movement form
or bowel movement frequency, and at the moment there is no reliable biological marker.
The multiple system-based criteria that have been developed...

The prevalence of celiac disease in IBS patients is four times greater than non-IBS patients.
So it is something to think about if you are considering IBS.
They recommend that to test for celiac disease in patients presenting with diarrhoea-related IBS symptoms.
They also mentioned another article that looks at the cost-effectiveness of doing a small biopsy and it is shown to be cost-effective in these patients.
They then go on to look at colonoscopies and studies have shown that while colonoscopies do yield positive results in patients with IBS,
no more so than in control groups.
And the positive results that they find are polyps, diverticulosis, angioedema and hemorrhoids.
So it is not routinely recommended.
However, in a patient who is older than 50, at the onset of symptoms, with alarm symptoms, it is recommended to do colonoscopy.
They also look at breath tests for malabsorption, which would help you in small intestine bacterial overgrowth.
And there is insufficient evidence to support this routinely.
They looked at the evidence and it shows that when using three different tests, lactulose, lactose, glucose and sucrose, the prevalence of small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS ranges from 4% to 64%.
It's not very helpful.
And this depends on which test is used and at what point they decide it becomes positive.
So the criteria of what a positive test is.
However, patients often report if they restrict their diet and leave out certain things, their symptoms do improve.
And so it is recommended that a patient who reports that kind of a symptom, that they should conduct a trial of food restricted diets.
But actually doing the test is not helpful.
Stool studies, in the absence of a travel history or a red flag alarm symptoms, it's not recommended.
So in summary, there's no actual biological marker that can help to diagnose IBS.
It's a symptom-based approach with careful investigations when recommended.
Bearing in mind that a lot of tests done to rule out other illnesses can actually increase the patient's anxiety if each test is coming back negative.
So bear that in mind as well.
Diarrhea, in diarrhea-prominent IBS, you need to rule out celiac disease and in a patient who is over 50 at the age of onset of the IBS, you can do a colonoscopy.
But IBS remains a diagnosis of exclusion.
