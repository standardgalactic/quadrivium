Now we want these three all to be written in point normal form.
So a good exercise for us.
Let's remind ourselves what point normal form is.
We have the vector and we do the dot product with a vector in that plane
and that is going to equal zero because the normal and the plane are perpendicular to each other.
We get this vector in the plane P0P by constructing a second point PX, Y, Z remember
and this becomes our point P0 with X0, Y0 and Z0
and we know that our vector is in component form ABC.
So for this vector P0P we're going to have X minus X0, Y minus Y0, Z minus Z0
and we're going to multiply that out by N.
So this is going to be a negative 2 X minus X0 so that's plus 1
then we're going to have our B which is 1 times Y minus Y0 is 3
and we're going to have a negative 1 there so that's minus
and we're going to have Z and that is minus negative 2
so that's plus 2 equals 0.
That is point normal form.
I'm going to multiply these out.
In other words this was A, X minus X0 plus B, Y minus Y0 plus C
sorry, Z minus Z0 equals 0.
That's point normal form.
Now what about this?
How am I going to change this into point normal form?
I can certainly get the vector, the normal vector to this plane.
First of all it's X to the power 1, Y to the power 1, Z to the power 1
so I'm dealing here with a plane.
Then I can get the normal to that plane
which is just going to be negative 3, 7, 2.
Now I need a point on that plane.
I need a point on that plane.
If you think about the three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system
if I have that in three dimensional space
and I have a plane that lies on there
if I have a plane and that plane is somewhere along the line
a plane will cross the Z axis
and think about it
if the point where it crosses the Z axis
no matter where this plane is located in space
once it crosses that Z axis
on that Z axis
X is 0 and Y is 0 as well
and that's a legitimate point in the plane.
So let's do that.
Let's set X equal to 0
Y equal to 0
then we get
2Z equals 10
in other words Z equals 5
so I now have a point in the plane
my point P0
which is X0, Y0, Z0
which is in our instance
this P0 is now 0, 0, 5
that is as legitimate a point
as legitimate a point in that plane as any other
so if I now take a second point in that plane
X, Y, and Z
and I construct P0, P
that is going to be X minus 0
that is going to be Y minus 0
and that is going to be Z minus 5
that is going to be my vector
now I'm going to multiply
do a dot product
with the N with the POP
so I'm going to get
a negative 3
X minus 0
I'm going to have a positive 7
Y minus 0
Y minus 0
and I'm going to have a positive 2
Z minus 5
positive 2Z minus 5
equals 0
so that is point normal form
of this equation of a plane
be careful though
I have chosen one point
and a normal
I could have constructed
I could have gotten any other point
if I knew any other point
I would get another point normal form
another point normal form
of this vector
so this is
one particular point normal form
equation
of this vector
now let's look at this
X minus 4Z equals 0
so it lies
in a plane where Y equals 0
so it's absolutely flat
it's going to lie absolutely flat here
how are we going to do that?
well first of all I can still construct
my normal vector
which is going to be
1, 0, negative 4
I can still construct
or I can still get a point
and let's get a point
where this plane
and this plane crosses
for instance
or which way can we put it?
let's just do the same
that X equals 0
and Y equals 0
Y is 0
in any case
that is going to leave me with
Z equals 0
that's going to leave me with a point
0, 0, 0
and we said it lies
absolutely flat
because Y has always got to be 0
in this plane
in other words
because if I construct now
my point
P0
which is now going to be
0, 0, 0
if I construct the point
PX, Y, Z
this is a
sort of a
funny looking
but quite legitimate
equation
so we're going to have
P0P
that vector
is going to be
X minus 0
comma Y minus 0
comma Z
minus 0
and if I now do
N dot product
P0P
I'm going to be left with
X minus 0
for my point normal form
plus
I'm going to have
0 times
Y minus 0
and I'm going to have
minus 4
Z minus 0
equals 0
and that is my
point normal form
point normal form
or a point normal form
of this vector
let's have a look
are these planes
parallel
so I have
4X minus Y
plus
2Z
and
8 equals 5
and 8X minus
2Y plus 6Z
equals 10
how do we know
two planes are
parallel
well
we construct
the two normals
the normal to
this plane
let's call this
for equation 1
it's going to be
4 comma
negative 1
comma 2
and for this one
in 2
it's going to be
8 comma
negative 2
comma 6
and for those
to be parallel
1 has just got to be
in 1
there's just got to be
some scalar value
times that
certainly if I do
2
2 times 4
is 8
2 times negative 2
is negative
2 times 2
is 4
but that one is 6
so these planes
are not
they are not
parallel
let's look at
this one
first thing we
have to do
is just write it
out so that
we can get
the normal
so this is my
equation 1
and this is my
equation 2
I'm going to have
8X minus
2Y minus
4Z plus
5 equals
0
so the normal
1 here is going
to equal
8 comma
negative 2
comma negative
4
and for equation
2
we're going to
have X
minus
a quarter
Y
minus a half
Z
equals 0
and what I can
do right now
is multiply the
whole lot
out by 8
that's going to
give me 8X
minus
2Y
minus
4Z
equals 0
and I can
immediately see
that indeed
there's just
this plus 5
difference
this normal
to 2
that was just
going to be
8
if I just
constructed this
it would be
1 a quarter
and a half
so this was
N1 is going
to be 8
times this
so anyway
here we have
that N1
equals N2
I've just
multiplied it
out
probably don't
do that
write this
normal as
1 comma
negative 4
comma negative
half
then N1
equals 8
times N2
so in other
words they
are indeed
those two
planes are
indeed
parallel to
each other
