The text uses a fictional scenario involving an alien invasion as a tangible example to introduce the concept of mathematical limits and demonstrate their real-life applications. It presents two equations: \( p(t) \), which models the population over time, and \( c(p) \), which describes the infection rate by aliens turning humans into aliens.

The red graph represents \( p(t) \), showing how the human population reaches a maximum limit of 20 as time progresses to infinity. This implies that there is a cap on how many people can be affected due to resource limitations and resistance from humans.

On the other hand, the blue graph for \( c(p) \) illustrates an infection rate that theoretically increases indefinitely without constraints. However, when combined with the population model \( p(t) \), it results in a green line representing \( c(p(t)) \). This green line indicates that the infection rate will also reach a limit due to the finite human population and their resistance.

This example is used to explain how limits can help model real-world scenarios by predicting future outcomes under specific constraints. It highlights the usefulness of mathematical modeling in understanding phenomena such as disease spread, where natural limits are often reached. The text encourages learning about limits to effectively apply them in various fields like medicine and beyond.
