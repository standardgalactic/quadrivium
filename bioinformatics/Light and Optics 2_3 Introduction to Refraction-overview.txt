Let's break down the physics concepts and calculations involved in your scenario, which deals with refraction, Snell's Law, and angles of deviation.

### Key Concepts

1. **Refraction**: The bending of light as it passes from one medium to another due to a change in speed.
2. **Snell's Law**: Describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction and the indices of refraction of the two media:
   \[
   n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \sin(\theta_t)
   \]
   where \( n_i \) and \( n_t \) are the refractive indices of the incident and transmitted media, respectively, and \( \theta_i \) and \( \theta_t \) are the angles of incidence and refraction.

3. **Angle of Deviation**: The angle between the direction of the incoming light ray and the outgoing light ray after passing through a prism or similar structure.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Light enters perpendicular to one surface, so there is no initial refraction at that interface.
   - Inside the medium, the refractive index \( n_t = 1 \) (air), and outside \( n_i = 1.55 \).

2. **Geometry and Angles**:
   - The incident angle inside the prism is given as 30 degrees.
   - Using geometry, you determined that the refracted angle \( \theta_t = D + \theta_i \).
   - Since the internal angle adjacent to the 30-degree angle is also 60 degrees (complementary in a triangle), and considering straight lines, another internal angle must be 30 degrees.

3. **Applying Snell's Law**:
   - Use Snellâ€™s Law at the interface where refraction occurs:
     \[
     n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \sin(\theta_t)
     \]
   - Substitute known values: \( n_i = 1.55 \), \( \theta_i = 30^\circ \), and \( n_t = 1 \).
   - Calculate \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \).

4. **Solving for the Angle of Deviation**:
   - From Snell's Law: 
     \[
     1.55 \times 0.5 = \sin(\theta_t)
     \]
     \[
     \sin(\theta_t) = 0.775
     \]
   - Find \( \theta_t \) using the inverse sine function:
     \[
     \theta_t = \arcsin(0.775)
     \]
   - Calculate \( D \):
     \[
     D + 30^\circ = \theta_t
     \]
     \[
     D = \theta_t - 30^\circ
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Compute \( \theta_t \approx 50.8^\circ \).
   - Thus, the angle of deviation \( D \) is:
     \[
     D = 50.8^\circ - 30^\circ = 20.8^\circ
     \]

### Conclusion

The angle of deviation \( D \) for the light ray passing through the prism is approximately \( 20.8^\circ \). This solution involves understanding refraction, applying Snell's Law, and using geometric relationships to find unknown angles.
