Let's break down the physics concepts and calculations involved in your scenario, which deals with refraction, Snell's Law, and angles of deviation.

### Key Concepts

1. **Refraction**: The bending of light as it passes from one medium to another due to a change in speed.
2. **Snell's Law**: Describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction and the indices of refraction of the two media:
   \[
   n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \sin(\theta_t)
   \]
   where \( n_i \) and \( n_t \) are the refractive indices of the incident and transmitted media, respectively, and \( \theta_i \) and \( \theta_t \) are the angles of incidence and refraction.

3. **Angle of Deviation**: The angle between the direction of the incoming light ray and the outgoing light ray after passing through a prism or similar structure.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Light enters perpendicular to one surface, so there is no initial refraction at that interface.
   - Inside the medium, the refractive index \( n_t = 1 \) (air), and outside \( n_i = 1.55 \).

2. **Geometry and Angles**:
   - The incident angle inside the prism is given as 30 degrees.
   - Using geometry, you determined that the refracted angle \( \theta_t = D + \theta_i \).
   - Since the internal angle adjacent to the 30-degree angle is also 60 degrees (complementary in a triangle), and considering straight lines, another internal angle must be 30 degrees.

3. **Applying Snell's Law**:
   - Use Snell’s Law at the interface where refraction occurs:
     \[
     n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \sin(\theta_t)
     \]
   - Substitute known values: \( n_i = 1.55 \), \( \theta_i = 30^\circ \), and \( n_t = 1 \).
   - Calculate \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \).

4. **Solving for the Angle of Deviation**:
   - From Snell's Law: 
     \[
     1.55 \times 0.5 = \sin(\theta_t)
     \]
     \[
     \sin(\theta_t) = 0.775
     \]
   - Find \( \theta_t \) using the inverse sine function:
     \[
     \theta_t = \arcsin(0.775)
     \]
   - Calculate \( D \):
     \[
     D + 30^\circ = \theta_t
     \]
     \[
     D = \theta_t - 30^\circ
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Compute \( \theta_t \approx 50.8^\circ \).
   - Thus, the angle of deviation \( D \) is:
     \[
     D = 50.8^\circ - 30^\circ = 20.8^\circ
     \]

### Conclusion

The angle of deviation \( D \) for the light ray passing through the prism is approximately \( 20.8^\circ \). This solution involves understanding refraction, applying Snell's Law, and using geometric relationships to find unknown angles.

Let's break down the physics problem involving light refraction through prisms and use Snell's Law to find the solutions.

### Problem Summary

1. **Prism with Non-Right Angle:**
   - Refractive index (\( n \)) = 1.55
   - Light enters perpendicularly (no initial refraction).
   - Inside, it refracts at an angle \( \theta_t \) and deviates by angle \( D \).
   - Given: Side angle = 30°.

2. **Objective:**
   - Find the deviation angle \( D \).

### Analysis

1. **Geometry Setup:**
   - Since light enters perpendicularly, it does not bend at the first interface.
   - Inside the prism, the incident angle is equal to the side angle (30°) due to symmetry.

2. **Using Snell's Law:**
   - At the second interface inside the prism:
     \[
     n_i \cdot \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \cdot \sin(\theta_t)
     \]
   - Here, \( n_i = 1.55 \), \( n_t = 1 \), and \( \theta_i = 30^\circ \).

3. **Calculate Refractive Angle (\( \theta_t \)):**
   \[
   1.55 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 1 \cdot \sin(\theta_t)
   \]
   \[
   1.55 \cdot 0.5 = \sin(\theta_t)
   \]
   \[
   \sin(\theta_t) = 0.775
   \]
   - Calculate \( \theta_t \):
     \[
     \theta_t = \arcsin(0.775)
     \]

4. **Calculate Deviation Angle (\( D \)):**
   - From geometry, \( \theta_t = D + 30^\circ \).
   - Therefore:
     \[
     D = \theta_t - 30^\circ
     \]
   - Substitute the value of \( \theta_t \):
     \[
     D = \arcsin(0.775) - 30^\circ
     \]

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     \theta_t \approx 50.8^\circ
     \]
     \[
     D \approx 50.8^\circ - 30^\circ = 20.8^\circ
     \]

### Conclusion

The angle of deviation \( D \) is approximately \( 20.8^\circ \). This solution uses Snell's Law and geometric relationships within the prism to find the deviation caused by refraction.
