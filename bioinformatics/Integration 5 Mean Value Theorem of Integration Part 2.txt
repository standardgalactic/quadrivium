Let us clarify the mean value theorem of integration with an example.
We are asked to find the average value of the function f of x equals 4 minus x on the
interval from 0 to 4 and at what value of x this average value has reached.
Here is a graphical representation of the problem.
The equation for the average value of a function on an interval is the definite integral on
the interval of that function the f of x with respect to x divided by the width of the interval.
In our example that is the definite integral of 4 minus x with respect to x on the interval
from 0 to 4 divided by 4 minus 0.
The anti-derivative of 4 is 4x, remember that 4 is the same as 4 times x to the power 0.
Add 1 to the 0 in the power and that is 1.
Dividing the coefficient 4 by this new power 1 and we have 4x.
The anti-derivative of minus x is a half x squared.
Again add 1 to the power which gives 2.
Dividing the coefficient which is 1 by this new power 2 leaves a half x squared.
In the denominator 4 minus 0 is 4.
We now have 4x minus a half x squared from 0 to 4 divided by 4.
Substituting first the upper value and then the lower value and subtracting the second
element from the first element is easy and we get a value of 2.
The average height of the function 4 minus x on the interval from 0 to 4 is 2.
To calculate at what x value this average height has reached we simply equate 2 to the function.
In other words 4 minus x equals 2 and that leaves x equals 2.
The orange rectangle whose height is the average value of our function which is 2 has a base
width of 4.
Its area is thus 8.
If we consider the definite integral of our function on the same interval we will notice
that it is also 8, the area under the curve on that interval.
This example is a good illustration of the mean value theorem of integration.
