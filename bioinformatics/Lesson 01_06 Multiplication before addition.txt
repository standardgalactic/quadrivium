Now remember the associative law. We can associate certain parts of an expression. And for that
to be executed first, the same happens in computer languages like Julia. And I've just
shown you here the order of operations. Now these are all little symbols that you'll be
unfamiliar with. Some of them would be, there's our fraction, and at least there's the little
carat sign there for what to do with powers. If I double click on that you can see how that
was constructed. What we're interested in is just this. Say, for instance, we say 2 minus
4 times 3. Of course it's going to do 4 times 3. Multiplication comes before subtraction, so
that's going to be 12. And so that's 2 minus 12. And indeed we get our answer there, negative
10. But we can force the issue by just simply putting our little parentheses around what
we want to execute at first. Times 3. So 2 minus 4 is negative 2. Times 3 is going to be negative
6. So just forcing the associative law, just associating things so that we can force the
order in which these operations are executed. So similar to normal pen and paper mathematics.
