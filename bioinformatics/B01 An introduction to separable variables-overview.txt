The text introduces the method of solving differential equations using separable variables. It describes how to handle equations in which the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is expressed as a product of two functions: one solely dependent on \( x \) and the other solely dependent on \( y \). The approach involves rearranging terms so that all expressions involving \( y \) are on one side, and those involving \( x \) are on the other. This can be achieved by dividing both sides by a function of \( y \), multiplying by \( dx \), and then integrating both sides separately with respect to their respective variables. The outcome is two integrals: one in terms of \( y \) and the other in terms of \( x \). Solving these integrals allows for finding a solution for \( y \) as a function of \( x \). The text suggests examining examples to illustrate this method further.
