The text introduces the method of solving differential equations using separable variables. It describes how to handle equations in which the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is expressed as a product of two functions: one solely dependent on \( x \) and the other solely dependent on \( y \). The approach involves rearranging terms so that all expressions involving \( y \) are on one side, and those involving \( x \) are on the other. This can be achieved by dividing both sides by a function of \( y \), multiplying by \( dx \), and then integrating both sides separately with respect to their respective variables. The outcome is two integrals: one in terms of \( y \) and the other in terms of \( x \). Solving these integrals allows for finding a solution for \( y \) as a function of \( x \). The text suggests examining examples to illustrate this method further.

The text introduces solving differential equations using separable variables. In this method, you start with an equation where the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is expressed as a product of two functions: one solely in terms of \( x \), and the other solely in terms of \( y \). The goal is to rearrange the equation so that all \( y \)-related terms are on one side and all \( x \)-related terms are on the other. This involves dividing by the function of \( y \) and multiplying by \( dx \).

Once separated, you integrate both sides: the left side with respect to \( y \), and the right side with respect to \( x \). These integrals yield two functions—one in terms of \( y \) and one in terms of \( x \)—which can then be solved to find \( y \) as a function of \( x \). The text suggests that this method allows for straightforward integration and solving, with examples provided to illustrate the process.
