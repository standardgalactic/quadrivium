The text provides an introduction to multivariable functions in calculus, distinguishing them from vector functions. It explains that while single-variable calculus deals with one independent variable (e.g., \(y = 3x^2\)), multivariable calculus involves multiple variables (e.g., \(f(x, y) = 3x^2 + xy + y^2\)).

Key points include:

1. **Definition**: A multivariable function has more than one input variable and maps them to a single output, which can be extended into three dimensions by adding another variable (e.g., \(z = f(x, y) = 3x^2 + xy + y^2\)).

2. **Partial Derivatives**: To differentiate multivariable functions, we use partial derivatives. The process involves treating all variables except the one being differentiated with respect to as constants.

3. **Notation**: Various notations are used for partial derivatives:
   - \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\) denote partial derivatives of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.
   - Alternative notation includes using subscript indices like \(d_1f\) for the first variable if written in a specific order.

4. **Vector Interpretation**: The gradient vector, which consists of all partial derivatives, is often denoted as \(\nabla f\) (or with bars or subscripts), representing how the function changes in each direction of its input variables.

5. **Caution on Notations**: Different textbooks may use various notations for these concepts, which can be confusing. It's important to recognize that different symbols might represent similar ideas across contexts.

Overall, understanding multivariable functions and their derivatives is crucial for exploring more complex mathematical landscapes beyond single-variable calculus.

The text provides an explanation and demonstration of how to calculate partial derivatives in multivariable calculus. It uses examples with variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) to illustrate the concept:

1. **Partial Derivatives**: The process involves treating other variables as constants while differentiating one variable at a time.
   - For example, when finding \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\), treat \(y\) and \(z\) as constants.
   - Similarly, \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\) treats \(x\) and \(z\) as constants, and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\) treats \(x\) and \(y\) as constants.

2. **Example Calculations**:
   - For a function involving terms like \(6x + y\), differentiating with respect to \(x\) gives \(6\), treating \(y\) as constant.
   - Differentiating with respect to \(y\) in an expression like \(x + 2y\) results in \(2\).
   - For a term like \(z^2\), \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\) yields \(2z\).

3. **Resulting Vector**: The collection of partial derivatives forms a gradient vector, such as \((6x + y, x + 2y, 2z)\). This vector represents the direction and rate of steepest ascent on a surface.

4. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - In three dimensions, this gradient vector can be visualized as describing the slope of tangent planes to surfaces.
   - The concept extends to higher dimensions (hyperplanes) in multivariable calculus.

5. **First Principles**: The text briefly mentions calculating derivatives using first principles, involving limits, which is a foundational approach but often avoided due to complexity.

Overall, the text emphasizes understanding partial derivatives and their application in visualizing changes along different axes in multidimensional spaces.

The text is explaining how to calculate partial derivatives using first principles, particularly focusing on differentiating multivariable functions. It emphasizes understanding the difference between single-variable \( x \) and vector notation where \( \mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \), with typical components being \( x, y, z \).

Here's a summary of the main points:

1. **Clarification of Notation**: The text highlights the importance of distinguishing between scalar \( x \) and vector \( \mathbf{x} \). In multivariable functions like \( f(x, y, z) \), each component (e.g., \( x_1 = x \), \( x_2 = y \)) is treated individually during differentiation.

2. **Partial Derivative Concept**: It explains that a partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to one variable (like \( x \)) involves treating other variables as constants and using the limit definition:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h, y, z) - f(x, y, z)}{h}
   \]

3. **Example with \( f(x, y, z) = x^2y + z \)**:
   - The text first calculates the partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) using standard differentiation rules: 
     \[
     \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy
     \]
   - It then uses the limit definition (first principles):
     \[
     \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h)^2y + z - (x^2y + z)}{h}
     \]

4. **Simplification Process**: Expanding and simplifying the expression:
   - Expand \( (x+h)^2y = x^2y + 2xhy + h^2y \)
   - Subtract \( x^2y + z \) from it, yielding: 
     \[
     2xhy + h^2y
     \]
   - Divide by \( h \):
     \[
     \frac{2xhy + h^2y}{h} = 2xy + hy
     \]
   - As \( h \to 0 \), the term \( hy \) vanishes, resulting in:
     \[
     \lim_{h \to 0} (2xy + hy) = 2xy
     \]

The text emphasizes understanding partial derivatives through both standard differentiation and foundational limit principles to solidify comprehension of multivariable calculus.

The text describes a process of simplifying an expression using the concept of limits as \( h \) approaches 0, which is a fundamental technique in calculus known as finding derivatives by first principles. It involves terms like \( x^2y - x^2y + z - z \), which cancel out to leave only the term with \( h \). By factoring out \( h \), it simplifies to \( 2xy + hy \). As \( h \) approaches 0, \( hy \) becomes 0, leaving the expression as \( 2xy \). This process is applicable in both single-variable and multivariable calculus. The text ends with repeated mentions of "Aladdin," which seems unrelated to the mathematical content and might be a placeholder or an error.

The text provides an introduction to multivariable functions, distinguishing them from vector functions. A multivariable function involves multiple input variables (e.g., \( f(x, y) = 3x^2 + xy + y^2 \)), unlike a single-variable function which has one input variable (e.g., \( y = 3x^2 \)). The text emphasizes that while first-year calculus typically deals with single-variable functions, multivariable calculus involves taking partial derivatives to understand how the function changes with respect to each independent variable.

Partial derivatives are calculated by treating all other variables as constants. For example, in \( f(x, y) = 3x^2 + xy + y^2 \), the partial derivative with respect to \( x \) treats \( y \) as a constant and vice versa. This process results in a gradient vector (or vector of partial derivatives), which can be represented using various notations like \( \nabla f = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}) \).

The text also touches on the notation used for multivariable calculus, noting that there are different ways to represent these concepts in textbooks. Understanding these notations is crucial, but it's important not to get confused by their complexity. For functions of three variables (e.g., \( z = 3x^2 + xy + y^2 \)), the gradient extends to three components, reflecting changes with respect to each variable involved.

The text is an explanation of how to compute partial derivatives in multivariable calculus. It uses the example function \( f(x, y, z) = 3x^2 + xy + y^2 + z^2 \). The author outlines the process for finding the partial derivatives with respect to each variable (\( x \), \( y \), and \( z \)):

1. **Partial Derivative with Respect to \( x \):**
   - Treat \( y \) and \( z \) as constants.
   - Differentiate \( 3x^2 + xy + y^2 + z^2 \) with respect to \( x \).
   - The result is \( 6x + y \).

2. **Partial Derivative with Respect to \( y \):**
   - Treat \( x \) and \( z \) as constants.
   - Differentiate \( 3x^2 + xy + y^2 + z^2 \) with respect to \( y \).
   - The result is \( x + 2y \).

3. **Partial Derivative with Respect to \( z \):**
   - Treat \( x \) and \( y \) as constants.
   - Differentiate \( 3x^2 + xy + y^2 + z^2 \) with respect to \( z \).
   - The result is \( 2z \).

The vector of partial derivatives, also known as the gradient, is given by:
\[ \nabla f = (6x + y, x + 2y, 2z) \]

This gradient vector represents the direction and rate of fastest increase of the function at any point in three-dimensional space. The author mentions that this concept can be extended to higher dimensions, where \( f \) could depend on more variables.

Additionally, the text briefly touches upon computing partial derivatives using first principles, which involves limits. This method is analogous to finding single-variable derivatives using limits but applied to functions of multiple variables.

The text discusses how to understand and compute partial derivatives of multivariable functions, specifically focusing on differentiating with respect to one variable while treating others as constants. It explains that in mathematical contexts, the same symbol (e.g., "x") might represent both vector components and independent variables depending on the context. The explanation is centered around a function \( f(x, y, z) = x^2y + z \), illustrating how to find the partial derivative with respect to \( x \).

The text emphasizes two approaches: the standard differentiation method by treating other variables as constants, and the "first principles" approach using limits. For the latter:

1. **Standard Method**: Recognize that differentiating \( f(x, y, z) = x^2y + z \) with respect to \( x \), you treat \( y \) and \( z \) as constants:
   - The derivative is \( 2xy \).

2. **First Principles (Limit Definition)**: Use the limit definition of a partial derivative:
   - Compute \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h, y, z) - f(x, y, z)}{h}\).
   - Substitute and simplify \( f(x+h, y, z) = (x+h)^2y + z \), resulting in:
     \[
     \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x^2 + 2xh + h^2)y + z - x^2y - z}{h}
     \]
   - Simplify to get \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xhy + h^2y}{h} = 2xy\).

This detailed walkthrough clarifies how partial derivatives can be derived using both intuitive and rigorous mathematical methods.

The text describes a process of simplifying an algebraic expression to find the limit as \( h \) approaches 0, using first principles from calculus. Initially, terms like \( x^2 y \), \(-x^2 y\), \( +z \), and \(-z \) cancel out, leaving only terms involving \( h \). The expression is simplified by factoring out \( h \), resulting in the limit of \( 2xy + hy \) as \( h \) approaches 0. Substituting \( h = 0 \) results in \( 2xy \), demonstrating a basic application of limits in multivariable calculus.

The repeated mention of "Aladdin" appears to be an unrelated or whimsical interjection, possibly for emphasis or humor, but doesn't contribute to the mathematical explanation.
