The text provides an introduction to multivariable functions in calculus, distinguishing them from vector functions. It explains that while single-variable calculus deals with one independent variable (e.g., \(y = 3x^2\)), multivariable calculus involves multiple variables (e.g., \(f(x, y) = 3x^2 + xy + y^2\)).

Key points include:

1. **Definition**: A multivariable function has more than one input variable and maps them to a single output, which can be extended into three dimensions by adding another variable (e.g., \(z = f(x, y) = 3x^2 + xy + y^2\)).

2. **Partial Derivatives**: To differentiate multivariable functions, we use partial derivatives. The process involves treating all variables except the one being differentiated with respect to as constants.

3. **Notation**: Various notations are used for partial derivatives:
   - \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\) denote partial derivatives of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.
   - Alternative notation includes using subscript indices like \(d_1f\) for the first variable if written in a specific order.

4. **Vector Interpretation**: The gradient vector, which consists of all partial derivatives, is often denoted as \(\nabla f\) (or with bars or subscripts), representing how the function changes in each direction of its input variables.

5. **Caution on Notations**: Different textbooks may use various notations for these concepts, which can be confusing. It's important to recognize that different symbols might represent similar ideas across contexts.

Overall, understanding multivariable functions and their derivatives is crucial for exploring more complex mathematical landscapes beyond single-variable calculus.

The text provides an explanation and demonstration of how to calculate partial derivatives in multivariable calculus. It uses examples with variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) to illustrate the concept:

1. **Partial Derivatives**: The process involves treating other variables as constants while differentiating one variable at a time.
   - For example, when finding \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\), treat \(y\) and \(z\) as constants.
   - Similarly, \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\) treats \(x\) and \(z\) as constants, and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\) treats \(x\) and \(y\) as constants.

2. **Example Calculations**:
   - For a function involving terms like \(6x + y\), differentiating with respect to \(x\) gives \(6\), treating \(y\) as constant.
   - Differentiating with respect to \(y\) in an expression like \(x + 2y\) results in \(2\).
   - For a term like \(z^2\), \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\) yields \(2z\).

3. **Resulting Vector**: The collection of partial derivatives forms a gradient vector, such as \((6x + y, x + 2y, 2z)\). This vector represents the direction and rate of steepest ascent on a surface.

4. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - In three dimensions, this gradient vector can be visualized as describing the slope of tangent planes to surfaces.
   - The concept extends to higher dimensions (hyperplanes) in multivariable calculus.

5. **First Principles**: The text briefly mentions calculating derivatives using first principles, involving limits, which is a foundational approach but often avoided due to complexity.

Overall, the text emphasizes understanding partial derivatives and their application in visualizing changes along different axes in multidimensional spaces.

The text is explaining how to calculate partial derivatives using first principles, particularly focusing on differentiating multivariable functions. It emphasizes understanding the difference between single-variable \( x \) and vector notation where \( \mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \), with typical components being \( x, y, z \).

Here's a summary of the main points:

1. **Clarification of Notation**: The text highlights the importance of distinguishing between scalar \( x \) and vector \( \mathbf{x} \). In multivariable functions like \( f(x, y, z) \), each component (e.g., \( x_1 = x \), \( x_2 = y \)) is treated individually during differentiation.

2. **Partial Derivative Concept**: It explains that a partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to one variable (like \( x \)) involves treating other variables as constants and using the limit definition:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h, y, z) - f(x, y, z)}{h}
   \]

3. **Example with \( f(x, y, z) = x^2y + z \)**:
   - The text first calculates the partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) using standard differentiation rules: 
     \[
     \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy
     \]
   - It then uses the limit definition (first principles):
     \[
     \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h)^2y + z - (x^2y + z)}{h}
     \]

4. **Simplification Process**: Expanding and simplifying the expression:
   - Expand \( (x+h)^2y = x^2y + 2xhy + h^2y \)
   - Subtract \( x^2y + z \) from it, yielding: 
     \[
     2xhy + h^2y
     \]
   - Divide by \( h \):
     \[
     \frac{2xhy + h^2y}{h} = 2xy + hy
     \]
   - As \( h \to 0 \), the term \( hy \) vanishes, resulting in:
     \[
     \lim_{h \to 0} (2xy + hy) = 2xy
     \]

The text emphasizes understanding partial derivatives through both standard differentiation and foundational limit principles to solidify comprehension of multivariable calculus.

The text describes a process of simplifying an expression using the concept of limits as \( h \) approaches 0, which is a fundamental technique in calculus known as finding derivatives by first principles. It involves terms like \( x^2y - x^2y + z - z \), which cancel out to leave only the term with \( h \). By factoring out \( h \), it simplifies to \( 2xy + hy \). As \( h \) approaches 0, \( hy \) becomes 0, leaving the expression as \( 2xy \). This process is applicable in both single-variable and multivariable calculus. The text ends with repeated mentions of "Aladdin," which seems unrelated to the mathematical content and might be a placeholder or an error.
