The text describes an initiative at Grutuskeer Hospital's Acute Care Surgery Unit aimed at enhancing medical students' engagement through gamification in education. Led by Jean, the head of the surgery unit, the project seeks to integrate game elements such as point scoring, leaderboards, and badges into a professional medical setting to motivate students toward achieving learning goals.

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Increase Engagement:** The primary goal is to enhance student involvement and motivation through gamified experiences without compromising clinical professionalism.
2. **Knowledge and Skills Improvement:** Gamification targets both improving exam performance and enhancing critical thinking skills essential for effective patient care.
3. **Digital Implementation:** A digital platform, such as a WordPress blog, was chosen for its familiarity and ease of maintenance among students.

**Project Design:**
- Students participate in various activities like presenting patients, assisting in surgeries, and discussing medical literature, earning points based on the importance of these tasks.
- The gamified system encouraged active participation in online forums where clinical experiences and knowledge were shared, significantly increasing engagement during traditional ward rounds.
  
**Challenges and Solutions:**
- Initial security issues with student login credentials were resolved by distributing physical copies instead of allowing self-registration.
- Managing the forum required daily evaluation of posts to ensure accuracy and relevance, which was labor-intensive but yielded positive outcomes.

**Outcomes:**
- The project successfully increased participation and knowledge sharing among students. It fostered professional interactions in clinical environments without adding extra workload.
- Students embraced the system naturally, similar to their use of social media, leading to enthusiasm and motivation reflected in real-time scoreboards on the blog.

Overall, the initiative proved successful in enhancing medical education through gamification, offering insights for future research and larger applications.
