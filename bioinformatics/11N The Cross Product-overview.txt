The text provides a concise overview of several key relationships and properties involving the dot product and cross product in vector algebra. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Dot Product with Cross Product**: 
   - The dot product of a vector with the cross product of itself and another vector is zero, because they are perpendicular.

2. **Granger's Identity**:
   - This identity relates the magnitude (norm) squared of the cross product of two vectors to the norms of the individual vectors and their dot product:
     \[
     \| \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} \|^2 = \|\mathbf{A}\|^2 \|\mathbf{B}\|^2 - (\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B})^2
     \]

3. **Triple Cross Product**:
   - Two vector triple product identities are presented:
     1. \(\mathbf{U} \times (\mathbf{V} \times \mathbf{W}) = (\mathbf{U} \cdot \mathbf{W})\mathbf{V} - (\mathbf{U} \cdot \mathbf{V})\mathbf{W}\)
     2. \((\mathbf{U} \times \mathbf{V}) \times \mathbf{W} = (\mathbf{W} \cdot \mathbf{U})\mathbf{V} - (\mathbf{W} \cdot \mathbf{V})\mathbf{U}\)

4. **Properties of the Cross Product**:
   - Anticommutativity: \(\mathbf{U} \times \mathbf{V} = -(\mathbf{V} \times \mathbf{U})\)
   - Distributivity over addition: \(\mathbf{U} \times (\mathbf{V} + \mathbf{W}) = \mathbf{U} \times \mathbf{V} + \mathbf{U} \times \mathbf{W}\)
   - Scalar multiplication: \(a(\mathbf{U} \times \mathbf{V}) = (a\mathbf{U}) \times \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{U} \times (a\mathbf{V})\)
   - Cross product with zero vector results in a zero vector: \(\mathbf{U} \times 0 = 0\) and \(0 \times \mathbf{U} = 0\)
   - A vector crossed with itself is zero: \(\mathbf{U} \times \mathbf{U} = 0\)

5. **Unit Vectors in Cartesian Coordinates**:
   - Unit vectors in the \(x, y, z\) directions are represented as \(\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}\) respectively.
   - Cross products of unit vectors follow specific patterns:
     - \(\mathbf{i} \times \mathbf{j} = \mathbf{k}\)
     - \(\mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{i}\)
     - \(\mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{i} = \mathbf{j}\)
   - The cross product of a unit vector with itself is zero, and the anticommutative property applies.

These equations and properties are fundamental in understanding vector operations and their applications in physics and engineering.
