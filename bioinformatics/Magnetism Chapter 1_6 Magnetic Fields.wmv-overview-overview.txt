To solve problems involving electron motion in a magnetic field, you need to consider both perpendicular and parallel components relative to the field:

1. **Convert Kinetic Energy**: Change energy from eV to joules using \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\).

2. **Calculate Velocity**: Use the kinetic energy formula \(KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\) to find velocity \(v\), with electron mass \(m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\).

3. **Determine Velocity Components**:
   - Parallel component (\(v_{\parallel}\)): \(v_{\parallel} = v \cos(\phi)\)
   - Perpendicular component (\(v_{\perp}\)): \(v_{\perp} = v \sin(\phi)\)

4. **Calculate Radius of Helical Path**: Use the perpendicular velocity to find radius:
   \[
   r = \frac{mv_{\perp}}{|q|B}
   \]
   where \(q\) is the electron charge (\(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)) and \(B\) is magnetic field strength.

5. **Find Period of Motion**: The period \(T\) for one loop is:
   \[
   T = \frac{2\pi m}{|q|B}
   \]
   This depends on the perpendicular component influencing circular motion.

6. **Determine Pitch of Helix**: Calculate pitch \(d\) (distance along the field per loop):
   \[
   d = v_{\parallel} \times T
   \]

### Key Points:
- **Perpendicular Motion**: Leads to circular motion, affecting radius and period.
- **Parallel Motion**: Results in linear movement along the magnetic field line, influencing helix pitch.

Ensure correct unit conversions throughout the calculations.
