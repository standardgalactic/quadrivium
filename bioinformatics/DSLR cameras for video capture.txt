and now we come to video equipment as you can see here two digital single lens reflex cameras
and these are what I use for most of the video recording on the left the smaller APS-C sensor
camera but what you can see here is obviously the nice articulated viewing screen and which
means you can tilt it around in a position where you want if you're recording yourself you can
actually see what you are recording and that makes it a very versatile tool to use now on the right
hand side here I have more upmarket full-frame camera that's my 5D Mark II obviously no hinge
screen on the side so even though I have greater depth of field coverage nicer camera to use it's
a bit awkward if you make videos of yourself because you can't see what is on the screen anyway
any kind of lenses can be attached to these the Canon EF lenses and they really allow for very
good video captioning and and good quality in the end
