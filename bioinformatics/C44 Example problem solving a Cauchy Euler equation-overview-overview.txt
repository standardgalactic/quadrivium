The text describes the process of solving a fourth-order differential equation with a non-constant coefficient by transforming it into a Cauchy-Euler form through substitution. Initially, let \( p = y''' \), which simplifies the problem to:

\[ x p' + 6p = 0 \]

By substituting \( p = c_1 x^{m-6} \) and solving for \( m \), we find \( m = -6 \). This gives us:

\[ y''' = c_1 x^{-6} \]

The solution involves integrating this expression three times to determine the original function \( y(x) \):

1. Integrate \( y''' \) to obtain \( y'' \):
   \[
   y'' = \frac{c_1}{-5} x^{-5} + c_2
   \]

2. Integrate \( y'' \) to find \( y' \):
   \[
   y' = \frac{c_1}{-4} x^{-4} + c_2x + c_3
   \]

3. Finally, integrate \( y' \) to determine \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{c_1}{-3} x^{-3} + \frac{c_2}{2} x^2 + c_3x + c_4
   \]

At each integration step, a new constant of integration (\( c_2, c_3, c_4 \)) is introduced. The text highlights that these constants remain arbitrary since division by another constant yields a new constant. This method illustrates solving higher-order differential equations using substitution and successive integration.
