The text explores properties related to determinants and matrix invertibility in linear algebra, focusing on specific conditions and general principles:

1. **Determinant Property**: Normally, the determinant of the sum of two matrices \( A + B \) does not equal the sum of their individual determinants (\(\det(A) + \det(B)\)). However, an exception exists if \( A \) and \( B \) differ by only one row or column. In such cases, \(\det(C) = \det(A) + \det(B)\), where \( C = A + B \).

2. **Invertibility and Determinants**: A matrix \( A \) is invertible if its determinant is non-zero. This connects the concept of determinants directly to matrix invertibility.

3. **Trivial Solution for Invertible Matrices**: For a square matrix \( A \), the equation \( Ax = 0 \) has only the trivial solution (\( x = 0 \)) if and only if \( A \) is invertible.

4. **Row Operations and Identity Matrix**: An invertible square matrix can be transformed into an identity matrix using row operations, indicating its reduced row echelon form (RREF) is the identity matrix.

5. **Elementary Matrices**: Any invertible matrix can be decomposed into a product of elementary matrices, which are derived from the identity matrix by applying single elementary row operations.

6. **Unique Solutions for Linear Systems**: If \( A \) is an invertible square matrix, then the equation \( Ax + b = 0 \) has exactly one solution for any column vector \( b \), ensuring consistent solutions across different values of \( b \).

The text underscores that invertibility ensures a unique solution to linear systems and ties this concept to elementary matrices and row operations.
