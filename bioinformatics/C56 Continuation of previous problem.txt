In actual fact, let's use the same problem and do that. Let's set the x prime of 0 to be equal to 0.
So I'm just letting it go. It has 0 initial velocity.
That means this part, this 10 square root of 2, c sub 2 is going to equal 0.
In other words, c sub 2 equals 0. It falls away completely and I only have c sub 1.
So it's not only that they're not the same, but it actually falls away.
So in other words, x of t would now have just been c sub 1 cosine of 10 square root of 2t.
And this c sub 1 was 0.1. So let's make that 0.1.
And that will now be the amplitude. That would now be the amplitude.
So it's going to be 0.1 positive down 0.1 negative up.
