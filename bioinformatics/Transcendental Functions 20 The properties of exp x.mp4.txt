Let's quickly look at the properties of the exponents of e to the power x.
And this is going to boil down to exactly the same as when we had, for instance, a to the power b times a to the power c.
And that is going to be a to the power b plus c.
Now let's take a look at what that means for Euler's number.
If we have e to the power x1 times e to the power x2, that is going to be exactly the same as e to the power x1 plus x2.
If we had e to the power negative x, that's going to be 1 over e to the power x.
If we have e to the power x1 divided by e to the power x2, that will be the same as e to the power x1 minus x2.
And if we had e to the power x1 and all of that to the power x2, that will be the same as e to the power x1 x2.
Let's have a quick look at proving one of these.
Let's prove, let's prove, let's prove, let's prove, let's prove this.
Let's open a new page.
Okay, we're going to prove, the proof for, the proof for e to the power x1 times e to the power x2 equals e to the power x1 plus x2.
Simply, let's start with two functions.
We are going to say that y1 equals e to the power x1 and we're going to have y2 equals e to the power x2.
Let's take the natural log of both sides of both equations.
Natural log of y1 equals the natural log of e to the power x1.
And that is simply the natural log of y1 equals x1 because that leaves, I'm just, all I've done is, I've brought this exponent forward by the properties of logarithms.
And I'm left with the natural log of e there, which is just 1, so that is x1 times 1, which is just x1.
On the other side, I'm going to also take the natural logarithm of both sides.
And that is going to be natural log of e to the power x2.
So, the natural log of y2 is going to be x2.
Now, let's simply add x1 plus x2 is going to be the natural log of y1 plus the natural log of y2.
I'm going to make use of the properties of natural logarithms or logarithms in general.
So, that's going to be y1, y2.
y1, y2.
Now, I'm going to exponentiate both sides.
All that means is I'm going to have base e there to the power x1 plus x2.
And that is going to be exactly the same as Euler's number to the power natural log of y1 times y2.
And we know what to do in this instance.
We said before, let me write it in red there.
That e to the power x equals the inverse of the natural log of x.
The inverse of the natural log of x.
In other words, I now have as my x value, as my x value, I now have this.
So, I'm going to have the inverse natural log of the natural log of y1, y2.
Those two cancel.
Oh, I think I've gone outside the edge, but you know what I'm talking about.
That is then going to leave us with e to the power x1 plus x2 is going to be equal to y1, y2.
And if I substitute those values, I get y1 was initially e to the power x1 and e to the power x2.
So, I've just proven.
That's ugly.
I have just proven our first property.
