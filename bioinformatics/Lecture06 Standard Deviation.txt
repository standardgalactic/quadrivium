Standard deviation
In this lecture we are going to look at the term standard deviation.
Very common term to use and very important to understand.
I'll use a bit of an analogy first. Imagine I am
back at school as a young boy and I live in a tiny little town
and all my friends live on the same street. If I walked out of my house
and looked up and down the street and imagined that in all the houses
I live to my left and to my right. In some of them my friends
live. And I imagine that I represent some average
value. Now I can measure the distance from my house to each of my friends
both left down the road and to the right up the road.
I can note that my first friend lives in a house 20 meters away. My second friend
lives in a house 30 meters away to my left.
Another friend lives 80 meters away to my right
house etc etc. I can add all those distances. Now
it doesn't matter whether my friend lives
to the left or to the right. These are not negative
distances and positive distances. These are just
different distances.
So I can measure up all these distances
and get their average.
So I can represent
the spread of all my friends.
What is the average distance
they are away from me. In essence that's
what I am doing. So if I am an average value
in this set of values A here
I can look at how far away
and remember in the previous video
what our average or our mean was
some of the values will be less than
some of the values will be higher than.
Now if I measured
how far removed each of these values was
from my average value
and as I say 9
for instance up top then B2
would be a negative distance away
because it is smaller than
standard deviation
disregards that. It will
immediately throw away that negative
and just see it as a positive distance.
It is a positive distance away from
my average. So it will just
combine all of those distances
each of these values
or values
each of these values are away from the average
sum them all up and divide by how many
they are. So let's have a look
and say equal
STD
and there we have
STDEV.P
and STDEV.S
and then the compatibility ones
at the bottom STDEV and STDEV.P
Now the S stands for sample
and the P for population
so most of the time in medical statistics
our patients
including our study is merely a sample
sample of the greater population
out there. So most instances
we are going to use the dot S
and under the compatibility functions
that will just be STDEV.
The STDEV P would be the same
as the dot P which is the newer
form and as I say
if you were to do some experiment
in the lab and the experiment
runs the whole population
of in existence
of your laboratory investigations
that might be
required to use the P value.
For us most of the time will be S
so I've used my arrow keys up and down
and I'm going to hit the tab key
to select that.
Once again I can just go down
all the way, select all of them, hit enter
or my
little green sign up there
and I get 3.0779906.
So I say 3.1.
So we know what the average was
and we know what the average distance
is. All of those values are away
from the mean.
They are 3.1
whatever the units were away from the average.
And that would be
explained as one standard deviation.
So I have an average and a standard deviation
of 3.1.
It means all the other values
in my data set are an average distance
of a 3.1 away from the average.
