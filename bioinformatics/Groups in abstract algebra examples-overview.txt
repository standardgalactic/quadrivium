The text discusses two examples of mathematical groups based on roots of unity under the binary operation of multiplication:

1. **Fourth Roots of Unity:**
   - The group \( A \) consists of the fourth roots of 1: \( \{1, -1, i, -i\} \).
   - The Cayley table for this group is provided, showing closure and associativity (left as an exercise to verify).
   - The identity element is 1.
   - Each element has a unique inverse: 
     - \( 1 \) is its own inverse,
     - \( -1 \) is its own inverse,
     - \( i \)'s inverse is \( -i \),
     - \( -i \)'s inverse is \( i \).
   - The group satisfies all the properties of a mathematical group.

2. **Third Roots of Unity:**
   - This set includes the third roots of 1: \( \{1, \omega_1, \omega_2\} \), where:
     - \( \omega_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \),
     - \( \omega_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \).
   - The identity element is 1 (denoted as \( \omega_3 \)).
   - The inverses are:
     - \( \omega_1 \)'s inverse is \( \omega_2 \),
     - \( \omega_2 \)'s inverse is \( \omega_1 \),
     - \( 1 \) is its own inverse.
   - Closure, associativity (assumed to hold), and the existence of unique inverses confirm that this set forms a group under multiplication.

The text highlights how groups naturally arise from roots of unity with specific operations.

The text provides an overview of two interesting examples of mathematical groups involving roots of unity under the operation of multiplication.

1. **Fourth Roots of Unity:**
   - The set \( A \) consists of the fourth roots of 1: \( \{1, -1, i, -i\} \).
   - These elements satisfy the property that each raised to the power of four equals one.
   - The binary operation is multiplication.
   - A Cayley table confirms closure and associativity (left for the reader to verify), identifies 1 as the identity element, and shows each element has a unique inverse within the set: 
     - \( 1 \) is its own inverse,
     - \( -1 \) is its own inverse,
     - \( i \)'s inverse is \( -i \),
     - \( -i \)'s inverse is \( i \).
   - This confirms that \( A \), under multiplication, forms a group.

2. **Third Roots of Unity:**
   - The set consists of the third roots of 1: \( \{1, \omega_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i, \omega_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\} \).
   - These elements satisfy the property that each raised to the power of three equals one.
   - The binary operation is multiplication.
   - A Cayley table demonstrates closure and associativity (again left for the reader), identifies 1 as the identity element, and shows unique inverses:
     - \( \omega_1 \)'s inverse is \( \omega_2 \),
     - \( \omega_2 \)'s inverse is \( \omega_1 \),
     - \( 1 \) is its own inverse.
   - This confirms that this set forms a group under multiplication.

Both examples illustrate how groups can naturally arise from algebraic structures involving roots of unity.
