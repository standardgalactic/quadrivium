The text discusses two examples of mathematical groups based on roots of unity under the binary operation of multiplication:

1. **Fourth Roots of Unity:**
   - The group \( A \) consists of the fourth roots of 1: \( \{1, -1, i, -i\} \).
   - The Cayley table for this group is provided, showing closure and associativity (left as an exercise to verify).
   - The identity element is 1.
   - Each element has a unique inverse: 
     - \( 1 \) is its own inverse,
     - \( -1 \) is its own inverse,
     - \( i \)'s inverse is \( -i \),
     - \( -i \)'s inverse is \( i \).
   - The group satisfies all the properties of a mathematical group.

2. **Third Roots of Unity:**
   - This set includes the third roots of 1: \( \{1, \omega_1, \omega_2\} \), where:
     - \( \omega_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \),
     - \( \omega_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \).
   - The identity element is 1 (denoted as \( \omega_3 \)).
   - The inverses are:
     - \( \omega_1 \)'s inverse is \( \omega_2 \),
     - \( \omega_2 \)'s inverse is \( \omega_1 \),
     - \( 1 \) is its own inverse.
   - Closure, associativity (assumed to hold), and the existence of unique inverses confirm that this set forms a group under multiplication.

The text highlights how groups naturally arise from roots of unity with specific operations.
