The text provides an explanation of how to represent the electron configurations of neutral atoms in their ground states using shorthand notation. It starts with hydrogen, which has one electron in the K-shell (1s orbital), and progresses through elements like helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, sodium, and explains how these configurations correspond to the periodic table.

Key points covered include:

1. **Electron Configuration Notation**: Each electron configuration is described using principal quantum numbers (n), subshell types (s, p, d), and the number of electrons in each subshell.
   
2. **Principle of Exclusion**: The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that no more than two electrons can occupy a given orbital.

3. **Ground State Configurations**:
   - Hydrogen: 1s¹
   - Helium: 1s² (full outer shell, noble gas)
   - Lithium to neon fill the first and second shells following similar patterns.
   - Sodium begins filling the third shell with a single electron in the 3s subshell.

4. **Periodic Table Correspondence**: The text highlights how these configurations explain periodic table trends:
   - Noble gases have full outermost shells, making them chemically inert.
   - Elements tend to gain or lose electrons to achieve stable (noble gas) configurations.

5. **Application Example**: It demonstrates how to write the electron configuration for krypton (atomic number 36), emphasizing the sequential filling of subshells until reaching a total of 36 electrons.

The explanation ties these concepts back to historical observations in chemistry, showing how Mendeleev’s periodic table was consistent with what we now understand about atomic structure and electron behavior.

The text explains how to determine electron configurations and assess whether a given configuration corresponds to an element in its ground state. It begins with basic arithmetic and lists of numbers leading to writing shell numbers (e.g., 1s², 2s²) up to 4p⁶ based on the periodic table's order. The text then discusses the capacity of electron subshells: a 5g subshell cannot hold 22 electrons because it holds at most 18 electrons according to the formula \( n \times (2l + 1) \), where \( l = 4 \). It clarifies that manganese, with atomic number 25, in an excited state has an electron configuration of 1s², 2s², 2p⁶, 3s², 3p⁶, 4s², 3d⁴, 4p¹. This is incorrect for the ground state because there are gaps before moving to a higher energy level (like 4p). The correct ground-state configuration should fully populate the 3d subshell before any electrons enter the 4p subshell.
