The text outlines key properties of logarithms involving multiplication, division, powers, and a special case:

1. **Multiplication**: The logarithm of a product can be expressed as the sum of the logarithms:  
   \(\log_a (b \times c) = \log_a b + \log_a c\).

2. **Division**: The logarithm of a quotient can be expressed as the difference of the logarithms:  
   \(\log_a \left(\frac{b}{c}\right) = \log_a b - \log_a c\).

3. **Power**: The logarithm of an exponentiated number allows the exponent to come down as a multiplier:  
   \(\log_a (b^c) = c \cdot \log_a b\).

4. **Special Case (1)**: The logarithm of a number with itself as the base equals 1, since any number raised to the power of 1 is itself:  
   \(\log_x x = 1\). 

These properties simplify calculations involving logarithms.
