in this lesson we're going to look at flow control now think about Julia as a language
in which you write lines of code and every line gets executed one after the other you might want
to write a piece of code though that you don't want every line to be executed you want some lines to
be skipped or you want some lines to be executed only under certain conditions now think about a
little raft going down a river the river forks and the raft can go down one of the forks and you can
force it to go down one or the other this is a very special kind of river because we can also have
tiny little loops where the little raft just goes round and round now this is all called flow control
we can control the flow of execution and let's have a look what we're going to see in this lesson
we're going to talk about the easiest one perhaps just branching our code through ternary operators
executing something or or not executing something or at least executing something else
by a ternary operator boolean switches we're going to have a look at the very useful if else if else
end conditions the for end loops we're going to have a look at compound expressions and then while
end loops let's start off with by looking at the ternary expressions now we're going to use what
is called the term ternary operator and you can see there it is a question mark now in this for this
lesson you'll see the code's already been written out it's just that in some places we're going to get
to multiple lines of code and I don't want to have to type all of those and waste some of your valuable
time that way so we're going to have the code here which you can work along with so first of all I'm
going to create this variable called a computer variable is going to call be called a it's this
little space in memory and inside of it I'm going to put a value which is 10 at this moment which is
an integer so if I run that line of code what Julia will do in the notebook it's going to print to the
screen this output 10 now here comes the ternary operator and it works like this first of all there's
my ternary operator you see the question mark and there's the colon so what does it do to the left of
the ternary operator is the question that we ask is a larger than 10 now remember a is just a computer
variable it holds a value and at the moment that value is 10 so the question there is really is 10
larger than 10 now after the ternary operator is the two branches that the program can now take
so the first one is if this question is true and then the colon and what comes after the colon is what
to do if the ternary operator returns a false so you can well imagine that this is false 10 is not
more than 10 it's actually equal to 10 so it's not going to execute this first lot it's going to execute
the second lot at the moment by this lot I mean it's just a string of text I can if I could put anything
in here some more code code to be executed etc I'm just using a string here as an example so let's run
this line this cell of code and indeed it's no it's not that's what's executed and it's just because
it's a string if I put other words in there those words would have been printed it's just that the
second lot or the lot after the colon gets executed if this is false so if I change this to a is larger
than or equal to 10 well 10 is equal to 10 so it's the first lot here the yes it is string that is going
to be executed and indeed it is this is a different way of doing it I can write everything in one line
r equals 1 and s equals 2 so two computer variables one called r one called s and each of them is going
to contain an integer value with r having the value 1 and s the value 2 I've put these the semicolon there
just to write everything on one line and the semicolon there is going to suppress the output to the screen
look what happens if I run that we just see a change to 4 there was no the q the code was not
written to screen so here we have this print line statement print l n it's not particularly useful
perhaps in the notebook more useful in the ripple in the terminal in a terminal window if you if you run
julia there but again whatever is in these little brackets and the parentheses are going to be executed
or it's going to be printed at least and it is a ternary operator that is going to be executed here
it asks is r less than s of course it is so it's going to print this first thing to this to the screen
if not it's going to print the second one and indeed one is less than two so we we know it is less that
is going to be executed and there we go just look at the difference though because it's print line it's
printing it without the quotation marks whereas here it did print as quotation marks again as I say not a
not a huge difference here in the in the notebook is r greater than s and of course no it's not going
to be if I run that line of code and just to show you here basically the print line output that gets
rid of those quotation marks when it does print to the screen next up we're going to look at boolean switches
a good thing just whisking
but I can't believe that they are passing out all of the atletons
I'll go check it out all of the random questions
all the charges
are going to be
