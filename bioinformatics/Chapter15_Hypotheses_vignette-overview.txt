In the lecture, the focus shifts to the foundational stage of conducting research: hypothesis formulation. Before beginning any empirical investigation, researchers need to establish their hypothesesâ€”specific predictions or educated guesses about what they expect to find. The speaker will discuss two essential types of hypotheses that must be clearly stated prior to initiating research activities. This step is crucial as it guides the direction and focus of the study.
