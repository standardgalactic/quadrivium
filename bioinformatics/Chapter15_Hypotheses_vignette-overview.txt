In the lecture, the focus shifts to the foundational stage of conducting research: hypothesis formulation. Before beginning any empirical investigation, researchers need to establish their hypothesesâ€”specific predictions or educated guesses about what they expect to find. The speaker will discuss two essential types of hypotheses that must be clearly stated prior to initiating research activities. This step is crucial as it guides the direction and focus of the study.

In the lecture, the focus is on the initial steps in conducting research, specifically the formulation of hypotheses. A hypothesis is an essential component that guides your study by proposing possible outcomes before data collection begins. The lecturer emphasizes there are two types of hypotheses typically stated prior to any research: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.

1. **Null Hypothesis (H0):** This hypothesis assumes no effect or no difference between groups in a study. It serves as a default position that indicates no relationship exists between variables being tested. The goal is often to challenge this hypothesis through your research, seeking evidence to reject it.

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):** In contrast to the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis suggests there is an effect or a difference. This represents what you aim to support with your data and analysis if the null hypothesis can be rejected.

Understanding these hypotheses is crucial as they frame the research questions and objectives, guiding the design and interpretation of the study.
