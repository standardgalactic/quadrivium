The text discusses three scenarios involving mirrors and image formation:

1. **Convex Mirror Scenario**:
   - An object of height 0.060 meters is placed 0.30 meters in front of a convex mirror with a radius of curvature of 0.40 meters.
   - The mirror's focal length is negative, as it is a convex mirror.
   - Using the mirror equation, the image distance (\( S_i \)) is calculated to be -0.12 meters, indicating a virtual image located behind the mirror.
   - The magnification results in an image height of 0.024 meters (2.4 cm), confirming that the image is erect and smaller than the object.

2. **Concave Mirror Scenario for Real Image**:
   - A concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 1.80 meters needs to form a real, inverted image half the size of the object.
   - The magnification required is -0.5, meaning \( S_i = 0.5S_0 \).
   - Solving the mirror equation, the object should be placed 2.7 meters from the mirror to achieve this image size.

3. **Concave Mirror Scenario for Virtual, Magnified Image**:
   - A concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 120 cm (focal length of -60 cm) is used to form an erect image four times larger than the object.
   - The magnification required is positive and equal to 4, resulting in \( S_i = -4S_0 \).
   - Solving the equations gives an object distance of approximately 45 cm (or 0.45 meters), placing it within the focal length for a virtual, erect image.

Each scenario uses specific optical principles to determine where objects must be placed relative to mirrors to achieve desired image characteristics.
