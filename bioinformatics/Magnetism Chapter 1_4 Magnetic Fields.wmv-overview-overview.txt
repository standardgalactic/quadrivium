Here's a summary of the provided text, broken down into two main parts:

### Part 1: Calculating Electric Field and Potential Difference

**Given:**
- A block with dimensions \(5 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m}\).
- Drift velocity of \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) in the x-direction.
- Magnetic field of \(30 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T}\) in the y-direction.

**Objective:**
1. Calculate the electric field inside the block.
2. Determine the electric potential difference across the block.

**Solution:**

- **Electric Field Calculation:**  
  The force due to the magnetic field is balanced by the force due to the electric field at equilibrium, leading to:
  \[
  \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = -\mathbf{E}
  \]
  With \(\mathbf{v} = 20 \, \hat{i} \, \text{m/s}\) and \(\mathbf{B} = 30 \times 10^{-3} \, \hat{j} \, \text{T}\), the cross product is:
  \[
  \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = 0.6 \, \hat{k} \, \text{V/m}
  \]
  Therefore, the electric field \(\mathbf{E} = -0.6 \, \hat{k} \, \text{V/m}\), indicating a \(0.6 \, \text{V/m}\) field in the negative z-direction.

- **Electric Potential Difference Calculation:**  
  The potential difference is calculated as:
  \[
  V = E \cdot d = 0.6 \times 2 = 1.2 \, \text{V}
  \]
  This results in a \(1.2 \, \text{V}\) potential difference, with the front face being positive relative to the back face.

### Part 2: Potential Difference in a Metal Strip

**Given:**
- Thickness of \(150 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\).
- Width of \(4.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}\).
- Magnetic field of \(0.65 \, \text{T}\).
- Current of \(23 \, \text{A}\).
- Known number of charge carriers per unit volume (\(n\)).
- Charge of an electron: \(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\).

**Objective:**
Calculate the potential difference across the width of the strip.

**Solution:**

- **Drift Velocity Calculation:**  
  The drift velocity (\(v_d\)) is determined using:
  \[
  I = n e A v_d
  \]
  Where \(A = w \times d\) is the cross-sectional area. Solving for \(v_d\):
  \[
  v_d = \frac{I}{n e w d}
  \] 

This setup allows you to calculate the potential difference across the width of the strip using the drift velocity and other given parameters.

The text describes the relationship between electric fields, potential difference, and velocity of charge carriers in a material, particularly through the Hall effect. The key equations are:

1. The electric field (\(E\)) is related to the potential difference (\(V\)) across a width (\(w\)) by \(E = \frac{V}{w}\).

2. From the Hall effect, the electric field can also be expressed as \(E = v_d B\), where \(v_d\) is the drift velocity and \(B\) is the magnetic field.

By equating these expressions for the electric field, we get:

\[ v_d B = \frac{V}{w} \]

Solving for the potential difference (\(V\)), the equation becomes:

\[ V = v_d B w \]

Substituting the expression for drift velocity \(v_d = \frac{I}{n e w d}\) (where \(I\) is current, \(n\) is charge carrier density, \(e\) is elementary charge, and \(d\) is thickness), we find:

\[ V = \left(\frac{I}{n e w d}\right) B w \]

**Conclusion:**

1. **Electric Field and Potential Difference in a Block:**  
   - The electric field inside the block is \(0.6 \, \text{V/m}\) directed negatively along the z-axis.
   - The potential difference across the block is \(1.2 \, \text{V}\).

2. **Potential Difference in a Metal Strip:**  
   - To find \(V\) for a metal strip, use the derived formula with known values of current (\(I\)), charge carrier density (\(n\)), elementary charge (\(e\)), magnetic field (\(B\)), width (\(w\)), and thickness (\(d\)).
