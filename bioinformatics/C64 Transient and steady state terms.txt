Now we just want to introduce this Transient and Steady State term.
There should be a T there.
This online version of OneNote just doesn't, if you want to use it on the Apple system,
it just doesn't allow for printing except in Firefox and then it does this as well.
So it's not that well programmed.
Anyway, in the previous example we had this as a solution.
This was our complimentary set and this was the particular set.
And what you will notice is that if you had to multiply e to the power negative 3
times some independent variable, if you distribute it in there,
this would become a non-periodic function.
And what I've done is here actually put it in blue
and it just goes, just drops below the x-axis and just becomes zero.
And that is called the transient term in this solution.
And then there's a steady state term as well.
And you can see we have this oscillation and then very quickly reaches steady state.
So this red part is the whole, the whole, the complete answer.
Just to show that this is a non-periodic function.
This is a periodic function and then the two combined will do this.
So we will say that if the uppercase f of t, that was the original driving force function divided by mass.
If that's a periodic function and that means either sine or cosine,
then the complementary set of solutions, the transient term and the p, the particular set,
becomes what we call the steady, the steady state term.
Now this part certainly we can still write in alternate form.
And then we've just got to add these terms as the, as the steady state, as the steady state term.
We'll get to that later.
Just to note that you get the, the transient and the steady state terms.
Then if you add them, will eventually, this transient term or its effect, it disappears.
As you can see there, it's just on its own.
So by the time it gets there, it has disappeared, leaving you just with a transient,
with a steady state term.
