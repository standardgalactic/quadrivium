The text discusses a scenario involving two objects moving towards each other and how their relative motion affects the observed frequency. The key points are:

1. **Relative Motion**: Both an observer and a source are moving towards each other. Their velocities in opposite directions affect the perceived frequency, with both contributing to an increased effect.

2. **Frequency Perception**: If we consider two submarines moving towards each other, the frequency heard by one due to the motion of the other can be determined by swapping their roles (observer becomes source and vice versa) as done in previous problems.

3. **Formula for Frequency**: When a source and observer move towards each other, the observed frequency is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   f_{\text{observer}} = f_{\text{source}} \times \left(\frac{v + v_{\text{observer}}}{v - v_{\text{source}}}\right)
   \]
   where \( v \) is the wave speed, \( v_{\text{observer}} \) and \( v_{\text{source}} \) are their respective velocities.

4. **Wavelength Calculation**: The wavelength of a wave in a medium depends only on the speed of the wave and the frequency observed, given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{v}{f_{\text{observer}}}
   \]
   This formula shows that the relative motion between source and observer does not affect the calculation of the wavelength directly. 

Overall, the text emphasizes how movement affects frequency perception and provides a method to calculate observed frequencies and wavelengths in such scenarios.
