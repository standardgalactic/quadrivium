The text discusses using the integral test for determining convergence and estimating errors in a p-series, specifically \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3} \). The speaker confirms that since \( p = 3 > 1 \), the series is convergent. They explain how to estimate the error when approximating the sum of the series with a partial sum, up to \( k = 100 \).

The integral test is applied by integrating \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3} \) from 100 to infinity, yielding an error estimation of \( \frac{1}{200,000} \). The speaker emphasizes that the convergence of the series allows for this error calculation using a specific inequality.

In subsequent content (presumably in another video), they plan to show how to determine the value of \( n \) such that the approximation's error is within a desired threshold. This involves setting up an inequality where the integral from \( n \) to infinity of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3} \, dx \) must be less than or equal to a given error bound (e.g., \( \frac{1}{200,000} \)). The speaker highlights that such problems in exams or real-life applications require applying these methods rather than simply recognizing convergence.

The text discusses determining an appropriate limit for a mathematical expression involving limits and inequalities. It focuses on evaluating the expression \(\frac{\star - 1}{2r^2}\) as \(r\) approaches infinity, ensuring it remains less than \(\frac{1}{200,000}\). The key steps include:

1. Setting up an inequality: \(\frac{1}{2r^2} + \frac{1}{2n^2} \leq \frac{1}{200,000}\).
2. As \(r\) approaches infinity, \(\frac{1}{2r^2}\) becomes negligible (approaches zero), simplifying the inequality to \(\frac{1}{2n^2} \leq \frac{1}{200,000}\).
3. Solving for \(n\): This leads to \(2n^2 \geq 200,000\), or \(n^2 \geq 100,000\). Therefore, \(n \geq 100\).

The conclusion is that the partial sum of at least 100 terms is necessary to ensure the maximum error in the approximation does not exceed a specified threshold. This provides a practical way to determine how many terms are needed to achieve desired accuracy in an experimental or computational context.

The text discusses using the integral test to determine the convergence of a p-series where \( p = 3 \). The series in question is \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\), which is known to converge because \( p > 1 \).

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Convergence Check**: The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3} \) is continuous, positive, and decreasing for \( x > 0 \). These conditions allow the use of the integral test to confirm convergence.

2. **Integral Test Application**: By evaluating the improper integral \(\int_{100}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^3} \, dx\), it is shown that the remainder (or error) when approximating the series by a partial sum (e.g., up to \( k = 100 \)) is small. Specifically, this remainder is calculated as approximately \( \frac{1}{200,000} \).

3. **Error Estimation**: The text explains how to estimate the error in using a partial sum to approximate the infinite series. This involves calculating the integral from a certain point \( n \) to infinity and ensuring it is less than or equal to a desired error threshold.

4. **Determining \( n \)**: The next step involves finding the value of \( n \) such that the remainder (error) when using the partial sum up to \( n \) is no more than a specified amount, in this case, \( \frac{1}{200,000} \). This involves solving the inequality \(\int_{n}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^3} \, dx < \frac{1}{200,000}\).

The text emphasizes understanding these steps to apply them in practical scenarios where exact values are needed for convergence and error estimation.

The text describes finding a limit involving an expression \(\frac{1}{2r^2} - \frac{1}{2n^2}\) as \(r\) approaches infinity. The goal is to ensure the expression remains less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{200,000}\). By substituting and simplifying:

1. As \(r \to \infty\), \(\frac{1}{2r^2} \to 0\).
2. This leaves \(\frac{1}{2n^2} \leq \frac{1}{200,000}\).
3. Rearranging gives \(200,000 \leq 2n^2\), which simplifies to \(100,000 \leq n^2\).
4. Solving for \(n\), we find \(n \geq \sqrt{100,000} = 100\).

Thus, the partial sum must be at least 100 to ensure the maximum error does not exceed \(\frac{1}{200,000}\). This allows setting a threshold for accuracy in an experiment by determining where to stop estimating the series.
