medical_data <- medical_data %>%
  mutate(time_difference = as.numeric(difftime(confirmation_date, onset_symptoms, units = "days")))

# Filter out negative differences
valid_data <- medical_data %>%
  filter(time_difference >= 0)

# Separate data by gender
female_data <- valid_data %>% filter(gender == 'Female')
male_data <- valid_data %>% filter(gender == 'Male')

# Plotting the time difference for each gender using boxplot
ggplot(valid_data, aes(x = gender, y = time_difference)) +
