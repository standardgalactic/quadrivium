Lecture 3 covers the Python `math` module, which enhances mathematical computations. Here are the key points:

1. **Importing the Math Module**: Use `import math` to access advanced functions and constants.
   
2. **Accessing Constants and Functions**:
   - Utilize constants like Pi (`math.pi`) and Euler's number (`math.e`).
   - Employ specific functions such as factorial (`math.factorial(x)`), exponentiation (`math.exp(x)`), logarithms (`math.log(x, base)`, with natural log as default), power calculations (`math.pow(base, exp)`), and square roots (`math.sqrt(x)`).

3. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - Calculate trigonometric values like sine (`math.sin(x)`) and cosine.
   - Convert between degrees and radians using `math.radians(degrees)` and `math.degrees(radians)`.

4. **Precision and Rounding**: 
   - The module uses floating-point numbers, which can introduce slight rounding errors (e.g., sine of Pi).

5. **Additional Functions**:
   - Includes advanced functions such as error and gamma functions.

The lecture emphasizes extending Python's arithmetic capabilities with the `math` module for complex calculations while understanding precision limitations in floating-point arithmetic.
