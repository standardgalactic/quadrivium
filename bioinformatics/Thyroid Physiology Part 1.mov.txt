The main function of the thyroid is to produce hormones.
There are three main hormones produced in the thyroid.
Thyroxin or T4, triodothyronin or T3, and calcitonin.
Inorganic iodide lands in the bloodstream from two main sources.
First, iodide is released by the breakdown of thyroid hormone in peripheral cells
and inorganic iodide is absorbed from the GIT.
This inorganic iodide in the bloodstream is absorbed into follicular cells
by a transmembrane protein against the chemical and electrical gradient.
It diffuses to the apical side of the cell and is absorbed into exocytic vesicles.
It is oxidized and bound to thytoglobulin to form MIT and DIT,
catalyzed by a peroxidized enzyme.
An MIT and a DIT molecule combine to form T3 and two DIT molecules combine to form T4.
It is stored in the follicular colloid.
It is reabsorbed into the cell with hydrolytic release of the hormones
and then released into the bloodstream where 99% is bound to circulating protein.
Calcitonin is released by paraphilicular C cells and they derive from neural crest ectoderm
that migrate into the supralateral aspect of the embryonic thyroid.
It is released due to an excess of calcium and chiefly decreases osteoclast calcium resorption.
