Now we're going to talk about line spectra. We should start this by saying anybody gives off electromagnetic radiation. If this was an infrared camera, you'd see infrared electromagnetic waves emanate from me, and indeed from everything else.
But if we just look at single atoms, you would note that they also give off electromagnetic radiation. But other than physical objects like myself, which will have a whole spectrum of wavelengths given off, what was noted a long time ago is that if you just take atom, we're going to look at atomic hydrogen.
So you take that gas in a vacuum tube, a bit of that gas, high potential difference across from place on the side, it gives off electromagnetic radiation, that atom, and through a diffraction grating, very fine slits, you can separate that as the electromagnetic waves that come from that gas then.
And you'll note that there's not a continuation, there's not a spectrum of wavelengths, that there are these individual wavelengths, and they make, because it's a diffraction grating, they make specific little lines.
And you can look up the line spectra. And you can look up the line spectra of atomic hydrogen, I might put a picture of that in there. And what was noted is, if you look at the electromagnetic spectrum, if this is gamma rays on this side, radio waves on this side, sitting here by ultraviolet, there were these lines, and then they go a bit further apart.
And then again in the infrared, they bunched up, and then they go further, and so let's say that's for visible light, and again then for the ultraviolet, again.
But what is noted is that on the smaller side, this in the ultraviolet was called the Lyman series, the Balmer series, after school teacher, in the 1800s, visible spectrum lines, and then the Russian series is in infrared.
So if you look at the red, you'll note that on the smaller side of that series, smaller wavelength side of that series, and then they sort of bunch up, and then they get further away, and then there's a final one, where it gets cut off.
And it was noted that these are the equations for these three series, and that is atomic hydrogen, so it's a proton with an electron around it, it's not molecular hydrogen, not H2, just H.
So 1 over the wavelength equals R, which is this Rydberg constant, at 1.097 times 10 to the power 7 inverse meters, times, now look at this, 1 over 1 squared minus 1 over N squared, where N is the integer starting from 2.
In the Balmer series, the integer starting from 3, and in the passion series, the integer starting from N, and we go from 1 squared to 2 squared to 3 squared in the denominator there.
So if we just wanted to look in the visible spectrum, which is the Balmer series, what would be the smallest wavelength, what would be the smallest wavelength?
So what we're going to go for here, what we're going to go for here, what we're going to go for here, is the smaller wavelength, is the larger number of N.
You can see from this equation there's 1 over lambda, and this is also in the denominator.
So the larger N is going to be, then you are going to get your smallest wavelength.
And the larger that N is going to be is N tends to infinity, and if N tends to infinity that becomes 0.
So we're going to have 1 over lambda equals the Rydberg constant times 1 over 4 minus 0.
If that tends to infinity, that term certainly tends to 0.
And that leaves you with the lambda of the lambda of the shortest wavelength, which is 365 nanometers.
So that would be certainly the last one of those bunches.
And then the largest one, before there's a gap, so for the Balmer series, the largest wavelength is going to be the smallest value of N,
and the smallest value of N there is going to be, so that's going to be 1 over 4 minus 1 over 3 squared, which is 9.
And that gives me a lambda of 656 nanometers.
So there's these definite cutoffs purely based on those equations.
