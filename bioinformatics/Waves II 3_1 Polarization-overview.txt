The text discusses how to understand and analyze the polarization of light. Here's a summary:

1. **Concepts**: Polarized light has lower intensity than unpolarized light because it oscillates in specific directions rather than all directions.

2. **Equations and Intensity**: The intensity of polarized light can be described using equations related to the electric field vector (\( \mathbf{E} \)) and its components. When considering a sinusoidal wave, this involves calculations based on the amplitude squared divided by constants like \( 2c\mu_0 \).

3. **Polarization Filters**: A polarized filter allows light waves oscillating in certain directions to pass through while blocking others. For instance, if light is passed through such a filter aligned along the y-axis, only the component of the electric field along that axis remains.

4. **Intensity Reduction**: When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, its intensity is reduced by half, a principle known as Malus's Law or the "one-half rule."

5. **Already Polarized Light**: If initially polarized light (with an existing direction of polarization) encounters a filter at an angle \( \theta \), only the component aligned with the filter’s axis passes through. The intensity is further reduced by \( \cos^2(\theta) \).

6. **Mathematical Relationships**:
   - For unpolarized light, passing through a polarizer reduces intensity to half.
   - For pre-polarized light at an angle \( \theta \), the outgoing intensity depends on \( \cos^2(\theta) \).

The text combines concepts of wave behavior with vector decomposition and trigonometry to explain how polarization filters affect light’s properties.

The text explains how light intensity changes when passing through polarizing filters. It begins by defining the cosine squared rule, which states that \( i = i_0 \times \cos^2(\theta) \), where \( i \) is the transmitted light intensity, \( i_0 \) is the initial intensity, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the light's polarization direction and the filter axis.

For unpolarized light passing through a polarizer aligned with one of its axes (e.g., the y-axis), half of the light's intensity is lost. Thus, the output intensity is halved.

When already polarized light passes through another polarizing filter at an angle \( \theta \) to its polarization direction, only the component along this new axis passes through. The transmitted intensity follows the cosine squared rule: it becomes proportional to \( \cos^2(\theta) \).

Key points include:
- If the filters are aligned (angle = 0 degrees), no loss occurs, and full intensity is transmitted.
- If the filters are perpendicular (angle = 90 degrees), no light passes through, resulting in zero output.

This illustrates why two crossed polarizers result in darkness: they block all the light due to their perpendicular orientation.
