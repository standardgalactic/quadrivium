The text discusses a method for calculating the length of a curve in the xy-plane using a line integral. It considers a scenario where the function \( z = f(x, y) \) is constant and equals 1, effectively creating a plane at height \( z = 1 \). The curve on this plane lies above an xy-plane curve described by parametric equations \( x(t) = e^t + 1 \) and \( y(t) = e^t - 1 \), with \( t \) ranging from -1 to 1.

To find the length of this curve, two methods are mentioned:

1. **Line Integral Method**: This involves integrating a constant function (in this case, 1) over the arc length \( ds \). Since the height is always 1, the line integral simplifies to calculating the arc length directly:
   \[
   \int_C 1 \, ds = \text{length of the curve}
   \]

2. **Vector Method**: This involves parameterizing the curve and computing its derivative with respect to \( t \). The norm (or magnitude) of this derivative gives the differential element \( ds \):
   - Derivative: \( \frac{d}{dt}(e^t + 1, e^t - 1) = (e^t, e^t) \)
   - Norm: \( \sqrt{(e^t)^2 + (e^t)^2} = \sqrt{2} e^t \)
   - Integral for arc length:
     \[
     \int_{-1}^{1} \sqrt{2} e^t \, dt
     \]
   This evaluates to \( \sqrt{2}(e^1 - e^{-1}) \).

The text illustrates that the line integral of 1 over this curve gives both the length of the curve and, conceptually, the area under a hypothetical "flat" shape with height 1 over the curve. This is analogous to calculating the area of a piece of paper where its base follows the curve in the xy-plane, and its top edge lies on the plane \( z = 1 \).

The text discusses calculating the length of a curve in the xy-plane using line integrals. It starts by describing a scenario where you have a plane \( z = 1 \) positioned above a parametrized curve given by \( (e^t + 1, e^t - 1) \), with \( t \) ranging from \(-1\) to \(1\).

The main idea is that the line integral of a constant function over this curve can yield the length of the curve. Specifically, for a constant height (in this case, \( z = 1 \)), the area under the plane and above the curve in the xy-plane is equivalent to the length of the curve itself.

To compute the length, you consider the line integral:

\[
\int_C 1 \, ds
\]

where \( ds \) represents an infinitesimal arc length along the curve. This can be expressed as:

\[
ds = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

For the given parametrization, \( x(t) = e^t + 1 \) and \( y(t) = e^t - 1 \), you compute:

- Derivatives: \( \frac{dx}{dt} = e^t \) and \( \frac{dy}{dt} = e^t \)
- Norm of the derivative vector: \( \sqrt{(e^t)^2 + (e^t)^2} = \sqrt{2} e^t \)

Thus, \( ds = \sqrt{2} e^t \, dt \). The line integral becomes:

\[
\int_{-1}^{1} \sqrt{2} e^t \, dt
\]

Evaluating this integral gives the length of the curve from \( t = -1 \) to \( t = 1 \):

\[
= \sqrt{2} \left[ e^t \right]_{-1}^{1} = \sqrt{2} (e^1 - e^{-1}) = \sqrt{2} \left(e - \frac{1}{e}\right)
\]

This result represents both the length of the curve in the xy-plane and, metaphorically, the "area" under the plane \( z = 1 \) when projected onto this curve.
