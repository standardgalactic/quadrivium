The text discusses a method for calculating the length of a curve in the xy-plane using a line integral. It considers a scenario where the function \( z = f(x, y) \) is constant and equals 1, effectively creating a plane at height \( z = 1 \). The curve on this plane lies above an xy-plane curve described by parametric equations \( x(t) = e^t + 1 \) and \( y(t) = e^t - 1 \), with \( t \) ranging from -1 to 1.

To find the length of this curve, two methods are mentioned:

1. **Line Integral Method**: This involves integrating a constant function (in this case, 1) over the arc length \( ds \). Since the height is always 1, the line integral simplifies to calculating the arc length directly:
   \[
   \int_C 1 \, ds = \text{length of the curve}
   \]

2. **Vector Method**: This involves parameterizing the curve and computing its derivative with respect to \( t \). The norm (or magnitude) of this derivative gives the differential element \( ds \):
   - Derivative: \( \frac{d}{dt}(e^t + 1, e^t - 1) = (e^t, e^t) \)
   - Norm: \( \sqrt{(e^t)^2 + (e^t)^2} = \sqrt{2} e^t \)
   - Integral for arc length:
     \[
     \int_{-1}^{1} \sqrt{2} e^t \, dt
     \]
   This evaluates to \( \sqrt{2}(e^1 - e^{-1}) \).

The text illustrates that the line integral of 1 over this curve gives both the length of the curve and, conceptually, the area under a hypothetical "flat" shape with height 1 over the curve. This is analogous to calculating the area of a piece of paper where its base follows the curve in the xy-plane, and its top edge lies on the plane \( z = 1 \).
