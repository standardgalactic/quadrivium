The text outlines the process of solving a second-order linear differential equation using the method of variation of parameters. The given differential equation has the form \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - y = \frac{1}{x} \), which simplifies to finding solutions for the homogeneous equation and then applying variation of parameters.

**Steps in solving:**

1. **Homogeneous Solution:**  
   The characteristic equation is \( m^2 - 1 = 0 \) with roots \( m_1 = 1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). This gives the complementary solution \( y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} \).

2. **Particular Solution via Variation of Parameters:**  
   The method requires finding particular solutions \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) such that:
   - \( y_p = u_1(x) y_1 + u_2(x) y_2 \), where \( y_1 = e^x \) and \( y_2 = e^{-x} \).
   
3. **Wronskian Calculation:**  
   The Wronskian of \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) is computed as:
   \[
   W(y_1, y_2) = \begin{vmatrix}
   e^x & e^{-x} \\
   e^x & -e^{-x}
   \end{vmatrix} = -2
   \]

4. **Integrals for \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \):**  
   Using variation of parameters:
   - \( u_1(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{e^t}{t} dt \)
   - \( u_2(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} t e^t dt \)

5. **Final Solution:**  
   The general solution is:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} + \frac{e^x}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt - \frac{e^{-x}}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} t e^t dt
   \]

The solution involves non-elementary integrals, which cannot be simplified further but are expressed in their integral form.

The text provides a step-by-step solution for solving a differential equation using the method of variation of parameters. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The differential equation is given in the form \(d^2y - y = f(x)\), with the homogeneous part solved first.

2. **Characteristic Equation**: Solving \(m^2 - 1 = 0\) yields roots \(m_1 = 1\) and \(m_2 = -1\).

3. **Homogeneous Solution**: The complementary solution is \(y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x}\), with basis functions \(y_1 = e^x\) and \(y_2 = e^{-x}\).

4. **Wronskian Calculation**: The Wronskian of the solutions is computed as \(-2\).

5. **Variation of Parameters**:
   - Express particular solution \(y_p\) using integrals involving the non-homogeneous term \(f(x) = 1/x\).
   - Calculate \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) using:
     \[
     u_1 = \frac{1}{-2} \int \frac{e^{-x}}{x} dx, \quad u_2 = \frac{-1}{2} \int \frac{x e^x}{x} dx
     \]
   - These integrals are non-elementary and expressed in definite integral form.

6. **Final Solution**: Combine the complementary and particular solutions:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} + \frac{e^x}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{e^t}{t} dt - \frac{e^x}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} e^t dt
   \]

The solution involves non-elementary integrals, which are expressed as definite integrals, providing a complete but complex answer.
