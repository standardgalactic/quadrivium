The text outlines the process of solving a second-order linear differential equation using the method of variation of parameters. The given differential equation has the form \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - y = \frac{1}{x} \), which simplifies to finding solutions for the homogeneous equation and then applying variation of parameters.

**Steps in solving:**

1. **Homogeneous Solution:**  
   The characteristic equation is \( m^2 - 1 = 0 \) with roots \( m_1 = 1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). This gives the complementary solution \( y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} \).

2. **Particular Solution via Variation of Parameters:**  
   The method requires finding particular solutions \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) such that:
   - \( y_p = u_1(x) y_1 + u_2(x) y_2 \), where \( y_1 = e^x \) and \( y_2 = e^{-x} \).
   
3. **Wronskian Calculation:**  
   The Wronskian of \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) is computed as:
   \[
   W(y_1, y_2) = \begin{vmatrix}
   e^x & e^{-x} \\
   e^x & -e^{-x}
   \end{vmatrix} = -2
   \]

4. **Integrals for \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \):**  
   Using variation of parameters:
   - \( u_1(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{e^t}{t} dt \)
   - \( u_2(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} t e^t dt \)

5. **Final Solution:**  
   The general solution is:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} + \frac{e^x}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt - \frac{e^{-x}}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x} t e^t dt
   \]

The solution involves non-elementary integrals, which cannot be simplified further but are expressed in their integral form.
