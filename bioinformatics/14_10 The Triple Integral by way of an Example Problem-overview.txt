The text describes a video tutorial on calculating a triple integral, which is an extension of the double integral to three dimensions. The focus is on evaluating the integral of a function \( f(x, y, z) = x \) over a tetrahedron defined by specific planes in 3D space.

### Key Steps:

1. **Region Description**:
   - The region (tetrahedron) is bounded by the coordinate planes (\(x=0\), \(y=0\), \(z=0\)) and the plane \( z = 2 - x - y \).
   - Limits for integration are derived based on these boundaries.

2. **Setting Up the Triple Integral**:
   - The integral is set up as follows: 
     \[
     \int_{x=0}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{2-x} \int_{z=0}^{2-x-y} x \, dz \, dy \, dx
     \]
   - \( z \) ranges from 0 to \( 2 - x - y \).
   - \( y \) ranges from 0 to \( 2 - x \).
   - \( x \) ranges from 0 to 2.

3. **Integration Process**:
   - Start with the innermost integral with respect to \( z \), integrating \( x \) over \( [0, 2-x-y] \).
   - Then integrate the resulting expression with respect to \( y \) over \( [0, 2-x] \).
   - Finally, integrate the result with respect to \( x \) over \( [0, 2] \).

4. **Result**:
   - The final evaluation of the triple integral yields a result of \( \frac{2}{3} \).
