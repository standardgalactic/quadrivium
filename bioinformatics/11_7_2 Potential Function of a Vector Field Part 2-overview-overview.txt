The text explores why certain vector fields lack potential functions using partial derivatives and integration. It presents examples in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) contexts:

1. **First Example (2D Vector Field)**:
   - The component \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 3x^2y \) is integrated with respect to \( x \), suggesting a potential function candidate \( f(x, y) = x^3y + g(y) \).
   - Differentiating this expression with respect to \( y \) gives \( x^3 + g'(y) \). Equating this to the given component \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = xy \) results in a contradiction, as \( g'(y) = xy - x^3 \) cannot depend only on \( y \). Thus, no potential function exists for this vector field.

2. **Second Example (3D Vector Field)**:
   - For the component \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xyz \), integration with respect to \( x \) suggests a potential function candidate \( f(x, y, z) = x^2yz + g(y, z) + h(z) \).
   - The text implies that similar steps would be applied for other components (like \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \)) to check for consistency and determine if a potential function exists.

The process involves using partial derivatives and integration to attempt constructing a potential function. The examples illustrate how inconsistencies in derived expressions indicate the absence of such functions.

Additionally, there is an informal discussion about resolving minor calculation errors, emphasizing that small mistakes do not significantly affect the overall task or its outcome. The speaker reassures themselves by focusing on the main issue rather than getting bogged down by trivial errors.
