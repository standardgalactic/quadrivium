In this video I discuss toxic adenoma.
A toxic adenoma refers to the presence of a hyper-functioning follicular adenoma in
an otherwise normal thyroid.
In rare instances there may be more than one adenoma.
As with toxic adenoma in multinodular goiter, there are TSH receptor and G protein gene
mutations involved.
These patients tend to be in their 30s or 40s and present with the symptoms and signs
of hyperthyroidism to a lesser extent than Graves' disease, without any eye or skin
symptoms, together with a neck mass that moves freely when swallowing.
These nodules tend not to develop hyperactivity until they are larger than about 3cm in diameter.
In some cases a rapid expansion or some other mechanism can lead to spontaneous hemorrhage
into the nodule with necrosis and relief of the hyperthyroidism.
In cases of spontaneous hemorrhage scintigraphy shows a cold nodule or a donut ring of hyperactivity
may be seen.
The cytography may indicate coarse calcifications, different from the fine calcifications of
papillary carcinoma.
Usually though, the scintigram shows a warm or hot nodule and ultrasonography differentiates
between a toxic multinodular goiter and Graves' disease.
TSH levels are suppressed and free T3 and T4 levels are elevated.
Some cases only have T3 elevation called T3 thytotoxicosis.
Again, the patient must choose between radioactive iodine therapy and surgery.
These patients are younger and are usually fit for surgery.
Unilateral thyroidectomy cures their hyperthyroidism leaving an otherwise healthy contralateral thyroid
lobe avoiding the dangers of hypothyroidism inherent in radioblative therapy.
