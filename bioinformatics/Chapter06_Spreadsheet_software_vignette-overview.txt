The lecture aims to introduce attendees to spreadsheet software, highlighting its utility in organizing data into columns and rows for easy collection. While spreadsheets are not ideal for statistical analysis, they serve as an effective tool for gathering data that can later be imported into Python for more advanced processing. The text also mentions a section about formulas but indicates there is no further information available on this part.
