The text provides a detailed derivation of the equations for velocity and acceleration in three-dimensional space using cylindrical coordinates. Here's a summary:

1. **Coordinate System Setup**: 
   - The world coordinate system is defined with \( \hat{k} \) as the vertical direction, \( \hat{i} \) as one horizontal axis, and \( \hat{j} \) completing the orthogonal basis.
   - A cylindrical coordinate system is introduced for a point \( A \), which helps express vectors relative to this frame.

2. **Vector Representation**:
   - The position vector of point \( B \) relative to point \( O \) is expressed as: 
     \[
     \mathbf{R}_{B/O} = \mathbf{R}_{A/O} + \mathbf{R}_{B/A}
     \]
   - In cylindrical coordinates, the vector from \( A \) to \( B \), \( \mathbf{R}_{B/A} \), is described by radial distance \( R \), height \( Z \), and angle \( \theta \).

3. **Velocity Derivation**:
   - The velocity of point \( B \) relative to the world frame \( O \) is derived using the chain rule:
     \[
     \mathbf{v}_{B/O} = \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{A/O} + (\dot{R}\hat{R} + R\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta} + \dot{Z}\hat{k})
     \]
   - Here, \( \hat{R} \) is the radial unit vector, and \( \hat{\theta} \) is the angular unit vector.

4. **Acceleration Derivation**:
   - The acceleration of point \( B \) relative to \( O \) involves taking derivatives of the velocity components:
     \[
     \mathbf{a}_{B/O} = \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{A/O} + (\ddot{R}\hat{R} + (2\dot{R}\dot{\theta} + R\ddot{\theta})\hat{\theta} + (\dot{R}\dot{\theta} - R\dot{\theta}^2)\hat{R} + \ddot{Z}\hat{k})
     \]
   - This results in terms grouped by unit vectors: radial (\( \hat{R} \)), angular (\( \hat{\theta} \)), and vertical (\( \hat{k} \)).

5. **Final Equations**:
   - The derived equations for velocity and acceleration in cylindrical coordinates are presented as straightforward applications of differentiation, considering the non-linear nature of the coordinate system.

This derivation highlights how cylindrical coordinates simplify expressions involving rotational motion by breaking down vectors into radial, angular, and vertical components.

The text describes how to derive equations for velocity and acceleration of a point B with respect to an origin O in three-dimensional space using cylindrical coordinates, which is more convenient than Cartesian coordinates for certain problems.

1. **Coordinate System Setup**:
   - The world coordinate system uses \( \hat{k} \) as the vertical direction, \( \hat{i} \) along one horizontal axis, and \( \hat{j} \) completing the orthogonal axes.
   - A point A in this system is used to establish a cylindrical coordinate frame where any other point B can be described relative to it.

2. **Position Vector**:
   - The position of B with respect to O (\( \vec{R}_{B/O} \)) is expressed as \( \vec{R}_{A/O} + \vec{R}_{B/A} \).
   - In cylindrical coordinates, \( \vec{R}_{B/A} = R\hat{r} + Z\hat{k} + \theta \).

3. **Velocity Derivation**:
   - The velocity (\( \dot{\vec{R}}_{B/O} \)) is derived by differentiating the position vector.
   - Since \( \hat{k} \) is constant, its derivative is zero.
   - The time derivative of \( R\hat{r} \) involves both \( \dot{R}\hat{r} \) and \( R\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta} \), where \( \hat{\theta} \) is perpendicular to \( \hat{r} \).
   - Thus, velocity in cylindrical coordinates becomes: 
     \[
     \dot{\vec{R}}_{B/O} = \dot{R}\hat{r} + R\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta} + \dot{Z}\hat{k}
     \]

4. **Acceleration Derivation**:
   - The acceleration (\( \ddot{\vec{R}}_{B/O} \)) is derived by differentiating the velocity vector.
   - Using the product rule, the derivatives of \( R\hat{r} \) and \( R\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta} \) yield terms involving \( \ddot{R} \), \( \dot{R}\dot{\theta} \), \( R\ddot{\theta} \), and \( -R\dot{\theta}^2 \).
   - The acceleration in cylindrical coordinates is:
     \[
     \ddot{\vec{R}}_{B/O} = (\ddot{R} - R\dot{\theta}^2)\hat{r} + (2\dot{R}\dot{\theta} + R\ddot{\theta})\hat{\theta} + \ddot{Z}\hat{k}
     \]

In summary, the text provides a method to express velocity and acceleration in three-dimensional space using cylindrical coordinates by differentiating position vectors and applying the product rule.
