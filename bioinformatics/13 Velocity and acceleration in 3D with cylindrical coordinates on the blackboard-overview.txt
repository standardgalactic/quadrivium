The text provides a detailed derivation of the equations for velocity and acceleration in three-dimensional space using cylindrical coordinates. Here's a summary:

1. **Coordinate System Setup**: 
   - The world coordinate system is defined with \( \hat{k} \) as the vertical direction, \( \hat{i} \) as one horizontal axis, and \( \hat{j} \) completing the orthogonal basis.
   - A cylindrical coordinate system is introduced for a point \( A \), which helps express vectors relative to this frame.

2. **Vector Representation**:
   - The position vector of point \( B \) relative to point \( O \) is expressed as: 
     \[
     \mathbf{R}_{B/O} = \mathbf{R}_{A/O} + \mathbf{R}_{B/A}
     \]
   - In cylindrical coordinates, the vector from \( A \) to \( B \), \( \mathbf{R}_{B/A} \), is described by radial distance \( R \), height \( Z \), and angle \( \theta \).

3. **Velocity Derivation**:
   - The velocity of point \( B \) relative to the world frame \( O \) is derived using the chain rule:
     \[
     \mathbf{v}_{B/O} = \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{A/O} + (\dot{R}\hat{R} + R\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta} + \dot{Z}\hat{k})
     \]
   - Here, \( \hat{R} \) is the radial unit vector, and \( \hat{\theta} \) is the angular unit vector.

4. **Acceleration Derivation**:
   - The acceleration of point \( B \) relative to \( O \) involves taking derivatives of the velocity components:
     \[
     \mathbf{a}_{B/O} = \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{A/O} + (\ddot{R}\hat{R} + (2\dot{R}\dot{\theta} + R\ddot{\theta})\hat{\theta} + (\dot{R}\dot{\theta} - R\dot{\theta}^2)\hat{R} + \ddot{Z}\hat{k})
     \]
   - This results in terms grouped by unit vectors: radial (\( \hat{R} \)), angular (\( \hat{\theta} \)), and vertical (\( \hat{k} \)).

5. **Final Equations**:
   - The derived equations for velocity and acceleration in cylindrical coordinates are presented as straightforward applications of differentiation, considering the non-linear nature of the coordinate system.

This derivation highlights how cylindrical coordinates simplify expressions involving rotational motion by breaking down vectors into radial, angular, and vertical components.
