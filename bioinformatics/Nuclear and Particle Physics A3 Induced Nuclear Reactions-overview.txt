The text discusses induced nuclear reactions, where external particles or radiation cause changes in atomic nuclei. These reactions can lead to transmutation, altering one element into another by changing its atomic number.

### Key Points:

1. **Induced Nuclear Reactions**: Unlike spontaneous decay, these reactions require an incident particle (like a proton, neutron, gamma ray, etc.) to collide with a target nucleus and induce changes.
   
2. **Transmutation**: This is the process of converting one element into another, such as nitrogen turning into oxygen.

3. **Conservation Laws**: The reactions must obey conservation laws, including nuclear number (total protons and neutrons) and electric charge.

4. **Examples**:
   - Striking nitrogen-14 with an alpha particle results in oxygen-17 and a proton.
   - Boron-10 struck by a proton produces lithium-7 and an alpha particle.
   - A gamma ray striking sodium-24 doesn't change the number of protons or neutrons, resulting in sodium-24.

5. **Transuranium Elements**: Induced reactions can create elements beyond uranium (atomic number 92), like neptunium and plutonium, which do not occur naturally on Earth.

6. **Example Problems**:
   - A copper-63 target struck by an unknown particle produces copper-62, a neutron, and a proton, resulting in a transient zinc-64 nucleus.
   - Striking magnesium-24 with a neutron results in sodium-23 and a deuteron (a nucleus of deuterium).

These reactions illustrate the power of induced nuclear processes to create new elements and isotopes.
