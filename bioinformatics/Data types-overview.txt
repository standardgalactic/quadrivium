This lecture discusses different ways to categorize data types essential for statistical analysis. Data types can be divided into two main categories: categorical and numerical.

1. **Categorical Data Types**: 
   - *Nominal*: These are labels or names without any inherent order, such as disease names or test outcomes.
   - *Ordinal*: These have a meaningful order but lack equal intervals between values, like survey rankings (e.g., strongly agree to strongly disagree) or star ratings for satisfaction.

2. **Numerical Data Types**: 
   - *Interval*: Numerical data without an absolute zero, where differences are meaningful, but ratios aren't. An example is temperature in Celsius.
   - *Ratio*: This type has a true zero point, allowing for meaningful comparisons of magnitude (e.g., hemoglobin levels or white cell counts).

The lecture also distinguishes between discrete and continuous numerical data:
- **Discrete Data**: Consists of distinct values with no intermediate possibilities, such as the outcome of flipping a coin.
- **Continuous Data**: Can be infinitely subdivided. Examples include measurements like white blood cell count or financial figures involving interest rates.

While it may seem straightforward to classify data as discrete or continuous, certain contexts can blur these distinctions. For example, although theoretically finite (like counting cells), in practical applications such as medicine or finance, these are often treated as continuous due to the scale and precision involved.

The text discusses the importance of understanding different data types in research. It highlights the distinction between continuous and categorical data, noting that while many datasets involve large orders requiring continuous data analysis, some research focuses on individual cells and may require different approaches. Key tests mentioned include the chi-squared test for categorical data and the students t-test for ratio type numerical data. Understanding these differences is crucial for appropriate data analysis. The text encourages reviewing lecture notes to gain a better grasp of these concepts.

This lecture discusses different ways to categorize data types, which is crucial for determining appropriate statistical analysis methods. Data can be categorized primarily into two main groups: categorical and numerical.

1. **Categorical Data**: 
   - Consists of subtypes called nominal and ordinal.
   - Nominal data includes categories that are words or terms without any inherent order (e.g., names of diseases). You cannot perform arithmetic operations on these, such as addition or multiplication.
   - Ordinal data has a meaningful order but does not allow for the quantitative comparison of differences between ranks. An example is survey responses like "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree."

2. **Numerical Data**: 
   - Includes interval and ratio types.
   - Interval data involves numbers without an absolute zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit). While you can discuss differences, you cannot say one value is twice another because the zero point isn't true zero.
   - Ratio data has a true zero, allowing for meaningful comparisons of magnitude. Examples include white cell count and hemoglobin levels.

Additionally, numerical data can be divided into discrete and continuous types:

- **Discrete Data**: 
  - Consists of distinct, separate values (e.g., coin flip results: heads or tails; gender classification).
  
- **Continuous Data**:
  - Can be divided infinitely and measured on a scale without gaps (e.g., white cell count, although in practical terms it is considered continuous due to the large numbers involved). Money, despite being represented in finite units like cents, is often treated as continuous in financial contexts due to decimal interest rates affecting large sums.

The lecture emphasizes that while some data types might not clearly fit into discrete or continuous categories, most clinical and financial analyses treat them as continuous for practical purposes.

The text discusses the importance of understanding various data types in research, particularly categorical and numerical data. It highlights that while continuous types are common, individual cell-level analysis might require different considerations. The chi-squared test is emphasized for categorical data, whereas the t-test is used for ratio type numerical data. Recognizing these distinctions is crucial for appropriate statistical testing and interpretation. The text encourages reviewing lecture notes for a deeper understanding of these concepts.
