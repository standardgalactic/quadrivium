The text provides an overview of preoperative pulmonary assessment strategies for patients with known respiratory diseases such as asthma or COPD, focusing on reducing the risk of postoperative complications like pneumonia and respiratory failure. Unlike cardiac assessments, which use structured algorithms, pulmonary evaluations rely more on risk assessment due to a lack of definitive research guidelines.

Key risk factors include age, existing COPD, cigarette use, congestive heart failure (CCF), functional status, ASA class, surgery duration and type, recent weight loss, long-term steroid or alcohol use, and a thorough clinical history. Emergency surgeries require immediate action without delay for tests, but non-emergent cases with uncontrolled symptoms or deviations from baseline need further investigation.

The recommended investigations are spirometry and chest X-rays, though their predictive value for postoperative outcomes is limited. Spirometry helps diagnose lung conditions and monitor therapy, while preoperative chest X-rays are common practice despite evidence showing minimal impact on management changes or patient outcomes. The discussion will continue in a subsequent lecture focusing on obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

The text outlines key points from upcoming lectures on preoperative pulmonary assessment, focusing primarily on patients with existing respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD, or those at risk of postoperative complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. Unlike cardiac assessments, which follow a clear algorithm, pulmonary assessments lack definitive research-backed protocols. Instead, practitioners are encouraged to focus on risk assessment and management.

The text lists various risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications: age, pre-existing COPD, cigarette use, congestive circulatory failure (CCF), functional status, higher ASA class, prolonged surgery duration, type of surgery, recent weight loss, long-term steroid use, and alcohol use. Emphasis is placed on obtaining a comprehensive patient history and clinical examination to evaluate symptoms like coughing, dyspnea, and orthopnea.

For emergency surgeries, preoperative tests are deemed unnecessary. However, for patients with known pulmonary disease who are not at their baseline, investigation may be warranted if there's unexplained dyspnea or exercise intolerance. The two primary investigations mentioned are spirometry and chest x-ray. While spirometry is valuable for diagnosing lung conditions and monitoring treatment, it has limited predictive value for postoperative outcomes. Similarly, routine preoperative chest x-rays above a certain age often do not alter patient management and have minimal impact on improving outcomes, although they remain standard practice in many healthcare settings.

The first part of the lecture series concludes with an introduction to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, which will be covered in detail in the next session.
