The text provides an overview of preoperative pulmonary assessment strategies for patients with known respiratory diseases such as asthma or COPD, focusing on reducing the risk of postoperative complications like pneumonia and respiratory failure. Unlike cardiac assessments, which use structured algorithms, pulmonary evaluations rely more on risk assessment due to a lack of definitive research guidelines.

Key risk factors include age, existing COPD, cigarette use, congestive heart failure (CCF), functional status, ASA class, surgery duration and type, recent weight loss, long-term steroid or alcohol use, and a thorough clinical history. Emergency surgeries require immediate action without delay for tests, but non-emergent cases with uncontrolled symptoms or deviations from baseline need further investigation.

The recommended investigations are spirometry and chest X-rays, though their predictive value for postoperative outcomes is limited. Spirometry helps diagnose lung conditions and monitor therapy, while preoperative chest X-rays are common practice despite evidence showing minimal impact on management changes or patient outcomes. The discussion will continue in a subsequent lecture focusing on obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.
