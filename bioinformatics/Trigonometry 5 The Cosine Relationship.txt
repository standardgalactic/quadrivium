The geometrical explanation of the law of cosines can be somewhat difficult to visualize.
Consider the following figure and let's sort out the information that it holds.
It is clear that the cosine of theta is x over a, thus x is a cosine theta.
The sine of theta is y over a, and thus y is a sine theta.
We can now use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the length of side c.
We have calculated the value of y, but what about the distance encompassing the lengths of x and b?
Note that as we have constructed the figure, x will hold a negative value.
Note also that point b will have coordinates of a cosine theta, a sine theta,
and thus an x value of a cosine theta.
Point a has coordinates b, 0.
Just for a moment suppose that x equals minus 3, and b equals 4.
The distance between x and b is 7.
But how do we get to 7?
Indeed there are a few ways.
One way would be to subtract x from b.
That would be 4 minus negative 3 and that is 7.
Another way would be to add the absolute value of x to b.
For our purposes we are going to square our result.
So let us choose a way to determine the length without having to resort to absolute values.
We can simply say x minus b, or negative 3 minus 4, and that is negative 7.
Squared would be positive 49.
So let us use a cosine theta minus b squared.
y squared would be a sine theta squared.
Adding these two gives us the value of c squared.
c squared is x minus b squared plus y squared.
Substituting for the known values of the square angled sides of our right triangle,
gives us c squared equals a times the cosine theta minus b squared plus a times the sine theta squared.
If we expand, we get c squared equals a squared cosine theta minus 2ab cosine theta plus b squared plus a squared sine squared theta.
We can rearrange this.
We can rearrange this and that leaves us with c squared equals a squared cosine theta plus a squared sine squared theta plus b squared and then minus 2ab cosine theta.
We have a common factor.
We have a common factor of a squared.
We have a common factor of a squared.
So c squared equals a squared times the cosine squared of theta plus sine squared of theta plus b squared minus 2ab cosine theta.
Since the cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals 1, we are left with the law of cosines.
c squared equals a squared plus b squared minus 2ab cosine theta.
So let's see what happens.
We have an operation that actually started running now.
So let's go back to it.
We can have a partnership between a avalanca,

So let's go back.
So I will focus on that.
