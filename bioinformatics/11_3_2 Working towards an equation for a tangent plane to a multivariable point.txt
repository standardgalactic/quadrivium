Now we've just looked at the gradient
the gradient of a function
and that again
reiterate that x means
a, b, c for a certain point or x, y, z
for the axis. We looked at the gradient. The gradient though
looks at something very specific. Say for instance my function
is of two variables. Then I'm going to have
a gradient of f in x and y
is going to be di f di x
and di f di y
or d1 of f of x and y
d1 or d2 of f and x and y
but remember we said this only looks at
this only looks at my three dimensional blanket
that I threw up in the head
along certain axis. This is a change in z
along the x axis and along the y axis.
Now what are we trying to get to here?
We're dealing just with differentiation. In other words
thinking back at one variable calculus
we're looking for the tangent line
the slope of the tangent line
and then the equation of the tangent line
here we're going to have a tangent slope.
So we're trying to get to
all of this builds up to the fact that
I want an equation for a tangent plane
to a curve at whatever certain point.
That's what we're trying to build to.
There's a second little thing that we're trying to build to as well.
Because in advanced calculus we're dealing with series
we want what we call a local linearization
a local approximation. Sometimes it is so difficult
to deal with that three dimensional
or even four, five, six, seven, eight dimensional
which we can't imagine in our minds
curve that we can't deal with the whole thing
we're only interested in a short, small piece of it
it's called a local, it's called local linearization
if we talk in x and y.
So not only are we interested in two things
the equation of the plane at a certain point
tangent to a certain point
and just as a line was something that's really straight
remember the plane is just going to be
also be a flat, flat, flat surface
absolutely a rigid, straight, flat surface
but that's not the only thing we're interested in
we're also interested in finding an approximation
if we can then somehow write an easier equation
that very nearly approximates our multivariable curve
in that region of a point
that might make life so much easier for us
that we have to do certain calculations
so those are the two things
in differentiation of multivariable calculus
we're interested in
we saw how to differentiate a vector
now we see how to differentiate
or at least get the partial derivatives
of a multivariable function
and we've seen that it actually
boils down to what we call a gradient
and that's the rate of change in certain axes
but now things get very interesting
more difficult but very interesting
when I had
when I had
just a single variable calculus
and I wanted to look at
the differentiability
at a certain point
and for instance
I had this sort of curve
I had a jump curve
if it was discontinuous
at that point
or I had another curve
which had a cusp
for instance there
or it was discontinuous like this
various reasons
why there is
there is not
or it's discontinuous
and you can't take
a derivative
at that
at that point
the limit doesn't exist
at that point
say for instance here
because
if I go from
the left hand side
or from the right hand side
to this point
I'm going to get
two different values
so the left hand limit
and the right hand limit
did not exist
now
if you think about it
the same thing
must happen
in multivariable calculus
not only in two dimensions
but in three dimensions up
the same thing
has got to happen
there might be something
wrong with that curve
which does not allow
for a tangent
to be
possible
at that point
and unfortunately
well fortunately
if you could take
the derivative
of this kind of function
it meant that
it was continuous
at that point
the same does not apply
for multivariable calculus
just because I have
this derivative
partial derivative
along one axis
and partial derivative
along the other axis
does not mean
there is automatically
that there is a smooth
curve
and that I
and I can get
a tangent plane
a tangent plane
there
unfortunately
you need something else
now here
we were just in this
single dimension
down here
so you could only
come from
from the left
or the right
when you took limits
the limit
if that is a
the limit
as x
tends to a
from the positive side
and from the negative side
remember we wrote that
but what about
a three dimensional
once again
think of my blanket
there is not just
two directions
along the x
and the y axis
I can come to a point
if I have this
if I have this
surface
here in three dimensional
space
if I have this curve
lying in three dimensional
space
then
at any point
I mean
I can come
I can come to this point
along the x axis
I can come to it
along the y axis
but I can actually
come to it
in from infinitely
many directions
imagine you made
a dot
in the middle
of a blanket
you can come to that
dot
along so many lines
along so many
curves
it is not only
from two directions
this was easy
this is
infinitely harder
okay
I can come
at this point
from any directions
and I better get
the same
I better get
the same
limit
for all of those
infinitely many curves
along which I can come
yeah I just came
yeah I just came
straight along the x
axis
straight along
the y axis
but I can come along
any curve
I can draw any curve
on that blanket
I can take
something
a marker
that can draw
a line on my blanket
I can draw
infinitely many curves
on that
and I've got to go
along all of them
through that point
and I better get
me give me
the same limit
value
for me to decide
that it is
smooth there
so that I can get
a tangent
and that is what
we're trying to get to
now let's look
at how we're going
to sort out
this problem
of coming
from infinitely
many directions
on this curve
to a single point
and one way
that we're going
to do this
is to
do the following
what we're
essentially dealing
with is this
we have a function
f of x and y
and we want
to take the limit
as x and y
x and y
approaches
some point
a b
of the f
of x of y
okay I can add
this in a different
form
remember I can
also write
the limit
as x approaches
p
and that p is a
vector
which has
two coordinates
this x vector
is also two coordinates
of the f
of x
now how can we
do that
well
instead of just
taking the gradient
which will be
along the x
and the y
axes
as a change
in z
along those
axes
the partial
derivatives
actually
let's answer that
and I'll get back
okay apologies
for that
I'm on call
we can do
something
that we can
construct a curve
now we're interested
in a certain point
p
certain value p
I can construct
just a single
curve
you know
just a single
line
going through
that point
and I can see
what the limit is
and I can choose
another one
through that point
and I can see
now obviously
if it doesn't exist
along a certain point
that means the limit
doesn't exist there
if I use two different ones
and I get different
values
it's the same as that
step function
I had before
and the limit
doesn't exist
if that doesn't
make a lot of sense
look
just keep on watching
I can construct
a certain curve
usually it's written
as a c there
let's have
the function
f of x
and y
f of x
and y
equals
x over y
obviously
it excludes
the domain
of f
excludes
y equals
zero
zero
and I want
to know
what the limit
is
as x and y
approaches
zero
comma zero
zero
comma zero
do I have a limit
there
well
let's look
at
a line
that crosses
through
that point
let's look
at the line
for instance
y equals
2x
so if I plug
in x equals
zero
y is also
zero
so this equation
I call
curve c
and that is a line
that goes through
this three-dimensional
curve of mine
z equals x
over y
and it goes
through that
very same point
the point
that I'm interested
in
the point
that I'm interested
in
now we're going
to deconstruct
this differently
we're now
looking for
this one
where this
is
zero
comma zero
what can I
do
now look
this
I write
the limit
as x
and y
approaches
zero
comma zero
along
curve c
along
curve c
of the
f
of x
and y
equals
so I'm
no longer
just genetically
going to
the point
I'm going
specifically
along
this curve
c
that I've
constructed
that must
satisfy
this point
must go
through that
point
and that
changes
things
to something
very simple
the limit
as x
goes to
zero
of the
f
of
x
comma
g of x
we call it
g of x
because this y
is the g of x
I've constructed
this curve
g of x
equals y
equals 2 of x
to go through
that point
specifically
and I'm going
to substitute
it in there
so what am I
left with
the limit
as x
tends to
zero
of the
f
of x
comma g
of x
so x
stays x
and y
becomes
the g of x
which is
2 of x
2 of x
the x
is cancelled
and my answer
is a half
so if I
go
to
this point
on my
three-dimensional
curve
z
equals x
over y
towards
on the x
axis
towards
oh not
along the x
axis now
it's not a
partial derivative
I'm going
along
this
I've reconstructed
call it a new
axis if you
want
I've constructed
a new axis
through that
point
and I see
well if I
do that
via
this thing
I get to
a half
I get to
a half
but what
if I
constructed
that's g1
let's make
the g1
what if I
constructed
another curve
g2
of x
and I
call that
3x
still goes
through my
point because
if I
substitute
zero in
there
y
remains
zero
and you
see what
is going
to happen
here
I'm going
to have
a 3
here
instead of
y
remember y
is now
equal to
3x
y is now
equal to
3x
and I'm
going to
have a
third
so coming
to that
point
coming to
that point
along a
different
curve
I'm going
to go
to that
point along
a different
curve
I'm going
to get
a different
value
here I've
got a
half
and here
I've got
3
those are
not equal
to each
other
in other
words
now I
can say
the limit
does not
exist
this limit
for this
function
as x
and y
approaches
0
does not
exist
similarly
if I
chose
any one
of these
and the
limit
did not
exist
I don't
even have
to test
for another
one
one limit
doesn't
exist
but
it was
a half
it was
a third
so this
partially
solves
this problem
for me
the problem
is what
if I
got
not in
this
instance
but in
other instances
I might
get the
same
answer
I might
take
4 curves
5 curves
10 curves
12
13
14
10
million
curves
and they
all come
to the
same
answer
that doesn't
help me
at all
because the
10 millionth
and 1
curve that I
chose
might have
been different
okay
so
this technique
helps
it helps
us
immediately
if one
of the
limits
does not
exist
or you
chose
two
after a
while
you start
to see
which ones
to choose
and you
can quickly
see
well they're
not the
same
thing
here
the limit
does not
exist
there
and if
the limit
does not
exist
there
that means
we can't
take a
tangent
plane
at that
specific
spot
and that's
what we're
trying
to get
to
okay
so it's
not as
simple
as just
taking
the two
partial
derivatives
for that
x and y
for us
just to
get to
an easy
way of
determining
the equation
of a
tangent
plane
to that
point
we have
to look
at whether
the limit
exists
as we
get to
that
point
and as
you can
see
that can
become
very
difficult
