The text provides an introduction to defining and using functions in Julia, highlighting different aspects of function syntax and behavior:

1. **Function Declaration**: You declare a function with the `function` keyword followed by a name (e.g., `MLTPL`) and a list of arguments (e.g., `X`, `Y`). Unlike some languages like Python, there's no need for a colon after argument lists in Julia; indentation automatically defines blocks.

2. **Return Values**: A function can explicitly return values using the `return` keyword. However, if `return` is omitted, the last expression evaluated within the function is implicitly returned as the result. This behavior allows multiple expressions separated by commas to be treated as a tuple.

3. **Examples**:
   - *MLTPL*: Prints a message and returns the product of two arguments.
   - *MLTPL2*: Similar to `MLTPL`, but omits an explicit return, showcasing implicit returning of the last evaluated expression.
   - *MLTPL3*: Illustrates that only the result of the final expression is returned if no `return` keyword is used.

4. **Returning Multiple Values**: Functions can return multiple values as tuples (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication results), which can be unpacked into separate variables.

5. **Optional Arguments and Defaults**: The text mentions upcoming content on handling optional arguments and default values, though it doesn't delve into specifics here.

This overview provides insight into basic function creation and behavior in Julia, setting the stage for more advanced features like optional parameters.
