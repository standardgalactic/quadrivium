To solve this problem, we need to find the gradient of the function \( f(x, y, z) = xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} \) at the point \( (1, 1, 0) \). The gradient vector \(\nabla f\) consists of the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

### Step 1: Compute the Partial Derivatives

#### Partial Derivative with Respect to \( x \)

Using the product rule, where \( u = xyz \) and \( v = e^{x+y+z} \):

\[
f_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z}) = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xyz)\right) \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(e^{x+y+z})
\]

Calculate each part:

- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xyz) = yz\)
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(e^{x+y+z}) = e^{x+y+z}\)

Thus,

\[
f_x = yz \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (yz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z}
\]

#### Partial Derivative with Respect to \( y \)

Similarly, using the product rule:

\[
f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z}) = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xyz)\right) \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(e^{x+y+z})
\]

Calculate each part:

- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xyz) = xz\)
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(e^{x+y+z}) = e^{x+y+z}\)

Thus,

\[
f_y = xz \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (xz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z}
\]

#### Partial Derivative with Respect to \( z \)

Again, using the product rule:

\[
f_z = \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z}) = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(xyz)\right) \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(e^{x+y+z})
\]

Calculate each part:

- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(xyz) = xy\)
- \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(e^{x+y+z}) = e^{x+y+z}\)

Thus,

\[
f_z = xy \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (xy + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z}
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Partial Derivatives at \( (1, 1, 0) \)

#### Evaluate \( f_x \) at \( (1, 1, 0) \)

\[
f_x(1, 1, 0) = (yz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0) \cdot e^{1+1+0} = 0
\]

#### Evaluate \( f_y \) at \( (1, 1, 0) \)

\[
f_y(1, 1, 0) = (xz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0) \cdot e^{1+1+0} = 0
\]

#### Evaluate \( f_z \) at \( (1, 1, 0) \)

\[
f_z(1, 1, 0) = (xy + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0) \cdot e^{1+1+0} = 1 \cdot e^2 = e^2
\]

### Step 3: Form the Gradient Vector

The gradient of \( f \) at \( (1, 1, 0) \) is:

\[
\nabla f(1, 1, 0) = \langle f_x(1, 1, 0), f_y(1, 1, 0), f_z(1, 1, 0) \rangle = \langle 0, 0, e^2 \rangle
\]

### Geometric Interpretation

The gradient vector \(\nabla f\) at a point gives the direction of the steepest ascent of the function at that point. In this case, at \( (1, 1, 0) \), the gradient is \(\langle 0, 0, e^2 \rangle\), indicating that the steepest increase in the value of \( f \) occurs in the positive \( z \)-direction. The magnitude of this vector, \( e^2 \), represents the rate of change of \( f \) in that direction.

The text discusses calculating the gradient of a function \( f(x, y, z) \), where \( e^2 \) seems to be related to this calculation. The speaker mentions having computed three partial derivatives and suggests that these form the components of the gradient vector at any point \((x, y, z)\). By substituting specific values \( x = 1 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( z = 0 \) into these partial derivatives, one can determine the gradient at this particular point.

The text then explains that while it might seem complex because it involves a four-dimensional space (including the function itself as an additional dimension beyond \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\)), the concept is about understanding how the function changes along different axes. This change corresponds to a hyperplane in 4D space, which can be difficult for humans to visualize. Essentially, this gradient represents the rate of change of the function with respect to each variable.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the gradient of the function \( f(x, y, z) = xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} \) at the point (1, 1, 0). The gradient vector consists of the partial derivatives with respect to each variable: \( \nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right) \).

### Step-by-step Calculation

1. **Partial Derivative with Respect to \(x\):**

   Using the product rule, we have:
   \[
   u = xyz, \quad v = e^{x+y+z}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial (xyz)}{\partial x} \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot \frac{\partial (e^{x+y+z})}{\partial x}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\partial (xyz)}{\partial x} = yz, \quad \frac{\partial (e^{x+y+z})}{\partial x} = e^{x+y+z}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = yz \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (yz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z}
   \]

2. **Partial Derivative with Respect to \(y\):**

   Similarly, using the product rule:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial (xyz)}{\partial y} \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot \frac{\partial (e^{x+y+z})}{\partial y}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\partial (xyz)}{\partial y} = xz, \quad \frac{\partial (e^{x+y+z})}{\partial y} = e^{x+y+z}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = xz \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (xz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z}
   \]

3. **Partial Derivative with Respect to \(z\):**

   Again, using the product rule:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial (xyz)}{\partial z} \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot \frac{\partial (e^{x+y+z})}{\partial z}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\partial (xyz)}{\partial z} = xy, \quad \frac{\partial (e^{x+y+z})}{\partial z} = e^{x+y+z}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = xy \cdot e^{x+y+z} + xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (xy + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z}
   \]

### Evaluate at the Point (1, 1, 0)

- **For \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \):**
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\bigg|_{(1,1,0)} = (yz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0) \cdot e^{1+1+0} = 0
  \]

- **For \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \):**
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\bigg|_{(1,1,0)} = (xz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0) \cdot e^{1+1+0} = 0
  \]

- **For \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \):**
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\bigg|_{(1,1,0)} = (xy + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} = (1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0) \cdot e^{1+1+0} = 2e^2
  \]

### Gradient Vector

The gradient of \( f \) at the point (1, 1, 0) is:
\[
\nabla f(1, 1, 0) = (0, 0, 2e^2)
\]

This vector indicates that at the point (1, 1, 0), the function \( f \) increases most rapidly in the positive \( z \)-direction.

The text discusses calculating partial derivatives of a function \( f(x, y, z) \), referred to as components of its gradient. These derivatives represent the rate of change of the function with respect to each variable (x, y, and z). The author mentions evaluating this gradient at the point \( (1, 1, 0) \).

The text also touches on the concept that while a surface is three-dimensional, adding another dimension for the function itself makes it four-dimensional. This visualization challenges human understanding, as it involves a hyperplane in four-dimensional space, which is difficult to imagine. The gradient at the specified point can be interpreted geometrically as this hyperplane in four dimensions.
