The text provides an introduction to logarithms, explaining their fundamental concept. A logarithmic expression like "log base a of b equals c" means that \(a\) raised to the power \(c\) equals \(b\). For example, \( \text{log}_2 8 = 3 \) because \(2^3 = 8\).

The text further illustrates this with an example: finding the value of \(x\) in the expression \( \text{log}_8 2 = x \), which asks "8 to the power what gives me 2?" By rewriting 8 as \(2^3\), we get:

\[ (2^3)^x = 2^1 \]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[ 2^{3x} = 2^1 \]

Thus, equating the exponents gives \(3x = 1\), so \(x = \frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, \( \text{log}_8 2 = \frac{1}{3} \) because raising 8 to the power of \(\frac{1}{3}\) results in 2. Logarithms essentially help find the exponent needed for a base number to produce a given value.
