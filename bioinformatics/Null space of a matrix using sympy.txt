in this video i want to show you a simple way to calculate the specific solutions for the null
space of a matrix so i've already typed a few things here but that's just to explain to you
again should you have forgotten what a null space is remember you can also watch some of my
playlists here on youtube i'll link to them below where you can watch videos on the null space
so i've just created a title here null space of a matrix you'll see i've named the notebook
null space of a matrix from simpi we're importing matrix and init printing let's run that and we're
just going to initialize in a printing with open and close parentheses so we do have large tech
printing to the screen you'll note that this next cell is already a markdown cell so what i want to
show you is these three equations in four unknowns so we have the four unknowns x sub one x sub two
x sub three and x sub four we see three equations so not really enough and we see that they're all
equal to zero i want to know the solution to this and you see that i've printed it here in matrix form
so i have my matrix of coefficients here i have this column vector here for which i want solutions
and that all equals this zero vector now if you're into spaces and subspaces the null space is always a
subspace of a larger space and we want to know what the null space is that what solutions here of
this four dimensional space here will give us these zeros so what we can do is we can just take this
matrix of coefficients and do gauss elimination on that and we get to this this row echelon form so this
is this matrix and we're going to do that just in some pi to see that we are correct and we see this
reduced form here and what we have at the bottom here is a row of all zeros
now look at it we don't have enough equations for unknowns another little thing to look at here if
you notice if we look at the column space so what this is saying i want x sub one times this first column
plus x i x sub two times the second column plus x sub three for the third column and x sub four times
the fourth column should equal the zero vector that's what we're doing here with a column space
but you'd notice that column two is just twice column one so if i take column one one two and three and i
multiply by two a scalar times this column vector one two three it gives me two four six so it gives me
that second column vector and that's a problem these are not independent of each other they this
is just a linear combination uh at least column vector two here it's a linear combination it's twice
this first column vector and that's going to leave us with issues here we see the zero zero zero
if i were to try and scribe this though just into a normal equations that we can you know that we are
used to just from this row echelon form it would say one times x sub one plus two times x sub two
minus two times x sub four equals zero and one times x sub three plus two times x sub four is going to
equal zero if i just simplify that by just getting one element on the left hand side this is all i'm
doing here it would say x sub one equals minus or negative twice x sub two plus two times x sub four
and x sub three equals minus two times x sub four this is what this row echelon form is showing us if
i just simplify it and now to get to those special solutions remember you're just going to let all the
unknowns here on the right hand side equals zero except one of them which will make one so let's start
off by making x sub four zero fortunately for us that means x sub three would also be zero as you see
here and make x sub two one so if x sub two is one and x sub four zero that means x sub one is negative
two and that leaves us with this first particular solution minus two one zero zero in as far as our
null space is concerned now we're going to let everything be zero except x4 if we make x4 one and all the
other zero well if x4 is one that does mean that x3 x sub three is negative two x sub two we set we
kept that at zero that means x sub one from this these two equations here is going to be two and there
we have a two zero negative two one and that is going to be the second special solution particular solution
in our null space and any linear combination of these two would still be in the null space and that would solve
our system of equations here so if that was too quick for you if you didn't fully understand please watch
some of my videos explaining this in detail let's create this matrix though in some pi so we can see how
very quickly we can get to these two particular special solutions so there's our matrix of coefficients
and i can just print this into reduced row echelon form remember we've done that very easily and that's
exactly what we saw there and i can just say a dot null space a dot null space open close parentheses
and there we go the two special solutions that we saw there there we go negative two one zero
negative two one zero zero and two zero negative two one two zero negative two one there they are as
simple as that you can do all your hard work come and check it in some pi very very easy to do to get
the null space and remember you can plug this into your system of linear equations and you'll get to the
zero vector on the right hand side either of them and any linear combination of them for instance three
times this plus four times that it's going to give you a new column vector and that will also be a solution
and all of these solutions together form the null space of this matrix here that we started with
so
see
you
a lot of
and
we're hit
and that looks like

this is
one
this is
this is
this is
this is
alright
what
we're going to be
on you
other

on you
let's
