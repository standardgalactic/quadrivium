The text provides a brief explanation of the linearity property of the Laplace transform. It states that the Laplace transform is linear, meaning that if you have two functions multiplied by constants, \( a \cdot f(t) + b \cdot g(t) \), their Laplace transforms can be expressed as:

\[ a \cdot \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} + b \cdot \mathcal{L}\{g(t)\} \]

This property allows you to bring constants outside the transform and handle each term separately. As an example, it demonstrates finding the Laplace transform of \( 1 + 4t \). Using linearity:

- The Laplace transform of 1 is \( \frac{1}{s} \).
- The Laplace transform of \( t \) is \( \frac{1}{s^2} \).

Thus, for \( 1 + 4t \), the Laplace transform is:

\[ \frac{1}{s} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{s^2} = \frac{1}{s} + \frac{4}{s^2} \]

This illustrates how to apply linearity and handle constants in Laplace transforms.
