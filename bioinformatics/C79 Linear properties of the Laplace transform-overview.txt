The text provides a brief explanation of the linearity property of the Laplace transform. It states that the Laplace transform is linear, meaning that if you have two functions multiplied by constants, \( a \cdot f(t) + b \cdot g(t) \), their Laplace transforms can be expressed as:

\[ a \cdot \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} + b \cdot \mathcal{L}\{g(t)\} \]

This property allows you to bring constants outside the transform and handle each term separately. As an example, it demonstrates finding the Laplace transform of \( 1 + 4t \). Using linearity:

- The Laplace transform of 1 is \( \frac{1}{s} \).
- The Laplace transform of \( t \) is \( \frac{1}{s^2} \).

Thus, for \( 1 + 4t \), the Laplace transform is:

\[ \frac{1}{s} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{s^2} = \frac{1}{s} + \frac{4}{s^2} \]

This illustrates how to apply linearity and handle constants in Laplace transforms.

The text explains the linearity property of the Laplace transform. It states that if you have two functions multiplied by constants and summed together, the Laplace transform of this sum can be expressed as the sum of the individual transforms of these functions, each multiplied by their respective constant.

For example, given a function \( af(t) + bg(t) \), where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, the Laplace transform is:

\[ \mathcal{L}\{af(t)\} + \mathcal{L}\{bg(t)\} = a\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} + b\mathcal{L}\{g(t)\}. \]

This means you can distribute the constants and apply the Laplace transform to each function separately. 

An example is provided: finding the Laplace transform of \( 1 + 4t \). Using linearity, this is:

\[ \mathcal{L}\{1\} + 4\mathcal{L}\{t\} = \frac{1}{s} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{s^2}. \]

This simplifies to \( \frac{1}{s} + \frac{4}{s^2} \). 

The key takeaway is that because the Laplace transform is linear, constants can be factored out and each function's transform handled independently.
