The text provides a detailed explanation on how to determine and classify critical points for a given function \( f(x, y) = x^3 + y^2 - 6xy + 6x - 3y + 1 \). Here's a breakdown of the key steps and conclusions:

1. **First Partial Derivatives (Gradient)**:
   - The gradient components are calculated as:
     - \( f_x = 3x^2 - 6y + 6 \)
     - \( f_y = 2y - 6x - 3 \)
   - Setting these equal to zero, two critical points are found: 
     1. \( (5, \frac{27}{2}) \)
     2. \( (1, \frac{3}{2}) \)

2. **Second Partial Derivatives**:
   - The second partial derivatives necessary for the Hessian matrix are:
     - \( f_{xx} = 6x \)
     - \( f_{yy} = 2 \)
     - \( f_{xy} = f_{yx} = -6 \)

3. **Hessian Determinant** (\(\Delta\)):
   - The determinant of the Hessian matrix is given by:
     \[ \Delta = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 = 12x - 36 \]

4. **Classification of Critical Points**:
   - Evaluate \(\Delta\) and \(f_{xx}\) at each critical point to determine their nature:
     1. **At \((5, \frac{27}{2})\)**:
        - \(\Delta = 24\) (since \(12(5) - 36 = 24\))
        - \(f_{xx} = 30\)
        - Since \(\Delta > 0\) and \(f_{xx} > 0\), this point is a **local minimum**.
     2. **At \((1, \frac{3}{2})\)**:
        - \(\Delta = -24\) (since \(12(1) - 36 = -24\))
        - Since \(\Delta < 0\), this point is a **saddle point**.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The critical point \((5, \frac{27}{2})\) is classified as a local minimum.
   - The critical point \((1, \frac{3}{2})\) is identified as a saddle point.

The analysis uses the Hessian determinant to classify the nature of critical points in determining where local minima or saddle points occur on the surface described by \( f(x, y) \). This method helps in understanding the behavior and topology of the function's graph.
