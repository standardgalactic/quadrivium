The text discusses transitioning from analytical methods of solving differential equations to numerical methods. Analytical solutions often involve deriving exact formulas or "recipes" for solving differential equations or systems of them, which can be challenging and isn't always possible. Most differential equations are solved numerically by plotting points to approximate a solution graph.

Initially, the focus is on initial value problems within this context, where only one specific solution from a family of solutions is required based on given initial conditions. The text highlights that numerical methods involve calculating x and y values to build an approximation of the solution curve rather than deriving exact equations.

A simple example given is \(y = x^2\), illustrating how to calculate slopes at any point using derivatives. It introduces the concept of tangent lines (representing instantaneous slope) and secant lines (approximating average slope over a segment). This lays the groundwork for developing Euler's method, named after mathematician Leonhard Euler.

Eulerâ€™s method is introduced as a basic numerical technique that uses known slopes at specific points to approximate the solution curve. It involves calculating new y-values based on initial values and given slopes across small intervals (\(\Delta x\)). The text prepares to delve deeper into this method by emphasizing its foundational reliance on elementary mathematics principles.

The text discusses an approximation method where reducing the interval size (\(\Delta x\)) allows closer adherence to a curve. It suggests that smaller intervals lead to better approximations of the desired function or shape. The author indicates that this approach has interesting origins and plans to share their perspective on it. They also mention examining specific points, such as a "half point," and imply using this method to explore particular regions more effectively. The text hints at mathematical techniques related to calculus, possibly involving concepts like Riemann sums or integration, where dividing into smaller intervals can yield better approximations of areas under curves.
