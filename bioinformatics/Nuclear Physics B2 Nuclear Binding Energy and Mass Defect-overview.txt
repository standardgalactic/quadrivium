The text discusses calculating the binding energy per nucleon for mercury-202 and provides an example problem involving potential energy change when a rock falls into a mine shaft. Here's a summary:

1. **Binding Energy Calculation for Mercury-202:**
   - The atomic mass of mercury-202 is given as 201.970617 units.
   - To find the binding energy per nucleon, consider breaking mercury-202 into its constituent particles: 80 protons (hydrogen nuclei) and 122 neutrons.
   - Use atomic masses for hydrogen (1.007825 u) and neutron (1.008665 u).
   - Calculate total mass of constituents and subtract from the mass of mercury-202 to find the binding energy in atomic mass units.
   - Convert this energy into mega electron volts (MeV) using the equivalency 1 atomic mass unit = 931.5 MeV/c².
   - Divide by the number of nucleons (202) to get the binding energy per nucleon, which is approximately 7.90 MeV/nucleon.

2. **Example Problem with a Falling Rock:**
   - A 245 kg rock falls into a mine shaft 4.2 x 10³ meters deep.
   - Calculate the change in gravitational potential energy using \( \Delta PE = mg\Delta y \).
   - The energy lost (binding energy) is approximately 1.0 x 10⁷ joules.
   - Using Einstein's equation \( E=mc^2 \), calculate the mass equivalent of this energy loss, resulting in a change in mass of about 1.1 x 10⁻¹⁰ kg for the Earth-rock system.

3. **Binding Energy for Removing Nucleons:**
   - Discusses binding energies when removing one neutron or one proton from nitrogen-14.
   - Calculations show that releasing one neutron requires less energy (10.55 MeV) compared to removing a proton (7.55 MeV).
   - This indicates that protons are more tightly bound in this nucleus than neutrons.

The text highlights the concept of nuclear binding energy and its calculations, alongside an analogy with gravitational potential energy changes.

The text explains how to calculate the binding energy per nucleon for mercury-202 and explores a conceptual question about energy changes due to gravitational potential energy in an earth-rock system. Here's a summary:

1. **Binding Energy of Mercury-202**:
   - The goal is to determine the binding energy per nucleon for mercury-202, which has an atomic mass number (A) of 202 and an atomic mass of 2.01,970617 units.
   - To find this, you calculate the total mass of its constituent protons (80 hydrogen atoms) and neutrons (122 neutrons), using their respective atomic masses from a reference table.
   - The binding energy is found by subtracting the mass of these nucleons from the actual mass of mercury-202. This difference is converted to energy units (mega electron volts, MeV) using an equivalence factor (1 unit = 931.5 MeV).
   - Dividing this total binding energy by the atomic mass number gives a binding energy per nucleon of approximately 7.90 MeV.

2. **Earth-Rock System and Potential Energy**:
   - A thought experiment considers a rock falling into a mine shaft, losing potential energy as it descends.
   - This loss in gravitational potential energy is equated to the concept of binding energy within an earth-rock system.
   - Using mass-energy equivalence (\(E=mc^2\)), the change in mass due to this energy conversion is calculated. The result shows a very small mass loss, illustrating how energy changes correspond to mass changes.

3. **Binding Energy Differences for Nucleons**:
   - Further exploration involves calculating the binding energies required to remove one neutron or one proton from nitrogen-14.
   - Using atomic mass units and conversion factors, it is shown that removing a proton requires more energy than removing a neutron, indicating a higher binding energy for protons in this context.

Overall, the text combines nuclear physics calculations with conceptual exploration of energy transformations.
