Let's continue our study of calculus by looking at integration.
Whereas differentiation determined the instantaneous rate of change, or the slope of a graph,
integration is used to determine the area under a graph.
Actually, in broader terms, the idea behind integration is to compute quantities
by dividing it up into smaller parts and then summing the contribution of each part.
Mathematically, it's all about determining area.
We all know the formula for calculating the area of a circle.
It is pi times the radius squared.
The area of a rectangle is its width times its height.
But what about this shape?
It is certainly not one of the main geometric shapes that we are familiar with.
It is defined on the left by the y axis,
at its base by the x axis,
and a curve defined by the function y equals 1 minus x squared in the first Cartesian quadrant.
When we started learning about differentiation, we considered the concept of a limit.
In integration, we start by considering the simple concept of addition and sigma notation.
And we will get to determining the area of this shape.
We will get started in the next movie.
In this image that ara Hi√ß today takes place in the very beginning,
we will get to the left before.
And divide by the combination and saithrange sat into the inner body and the upper body,
we make a resistance and glimpsus of a little more depth.
