So let's have a look at this first separable variable problem.
We have 1 plus x dy minus y dx equals 0.
Why can we separate it?
Well, this 1 plus x we can see as the g of x.
And this we can see as the h of y.
And we can clearly separate them in as much as we can have 1 plus x dy equals y dx.
Okay, now simply bring this over to the other side.
That will be 1 over y dy equals 1 over 1 plus x dx.
I can transform this equation by taking the integral of both sides,
which will leave me with the natural log of the absolute value of y
equaling the natural log of the absolute value of 1 plus x
plus some constant c.
We'll call that c1.
To get rid of the natural logs, I can write all of this as exponents.
e to the power.
This will leave me with y equals...
This will be...
On this side, there'll be an e to the power c1.
And on this side, there'll be an e to the power...
Well, not...
Let me get my eraser from here.
e to the power of the natural log of anything remains that.
Anything that's 1 plus x.
Now, these are an absolute value, and those were the y was as well.
But e to the power c1, I can just write as c2.
c2, 1 plus x.
And depending on what the value of c is, it can have any sign.
That can give us positives or negatives.
So, I can leave out this absolute value sign.
So, that this is going to leave me with c1 plus x.
And that is a family of solutions depending on what value c is going to take.
Okay?
