The text discusses acute cholecystitis, a common complication of gallstones managed at the Q-Care Surgery Unit of Grytiskir Hospital. This condition arises when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct, causing inflammation and various complications in the gallbladder. 

**Prevalence:** Acute cholecystitis is more frequent among females across different age groups.

**Symptoms:** Patients typically experience persistent pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastric area, along with nausea, vomiting, fever, tachycardia, and dehydration.

**Diagnosis:** Diagnosis involves a raised white cell count with neutrophilia, signs of dehydration (e.g., high urea), normal bilirubin levels, ultrasound findings such as gallstones, thickened gallbladder wall, and pericolecystic fluid. A positive Murphy's sign also aids diagnosis.

**Treatment:** Initial treatment includes IV fluids, electrolyte monitoring, analgesia, and antibiotics. The definitive treatment is a cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder), ideally performed within three to seven days after diagnosis.

The text notes that while some patients with asymptomatic gallstones may not develop acute cholecystitis, logistical issues can delay surgery due to late presentations or overbooked operating theaters. 

For treatment approaches, it describes using antibiotics initially, followed by elective cholecystectomy six weeks later if the patient improves. Early diagnosis could allow for immediate surgical intervention.

For patients unresponsive to antibiotics, a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is a newer option, though its long-term management requires further research. Percutaneous drains are used in severely ill patients unable to undergo surgery. The text summarizes both standard and alternative treatments for acute calculus cholecystitis.
