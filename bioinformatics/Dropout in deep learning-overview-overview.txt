The text explains dropout regularization as a method to combat overfitting or high variance in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on validation or real-world data. Dropout addresses this by randomly setting some nodes' outputs to zero during training, effectively "dropping" certain neurons.

This process involves generating a mask of zeros and ones for each layer's nodes based on a predefined probability (keep probability). The dropped neurons are compensated by scaling up the active ones, ensuring consistent output levels. This technique simplifies the model during training, which can improve generalization to unseen data. Dropout is easy to implement in existing models with minimal code changes.

The text also suggests that future discussions might explore combining dropout with L2 regularization for further overfitting reduction in datasets.
