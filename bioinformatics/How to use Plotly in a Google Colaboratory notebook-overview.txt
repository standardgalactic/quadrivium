This tutorial explains how to use Plotly within Google's Colab environment. It begins by opening a new Jupyter notebook as a Colaboratory file on Google Drive, mentioning that Plotly is one of the pre-loaded libraries, making it easy to import and use without issues.

The steps outlined include:
1. Importing necessary packages: `numpy` for numerical operations, `stats` from `scipy` for data simulation, and specific functions (`iPlot`, `init_notebook_mode`) from `plotly.offline`.
2. Additionally, importing `graph_objects` from Plotly as `go`.

The tutorial emphasizes the need to configure each cell that will render a Plotly graph by creating a function named `configure_plotly_browser_state`. This function uses IPython's display capabilities and must be called in every relevant cell to initialize Plotly's notebook mode.

To demonstrate, simulated data (white cell count) is generated using a normal distribution with specified parameters. The tutorial guides the user through setting up a histogram plot of this data using standard Plotly syntax (`go.Histogram`), customizing the layout for better visualization, and rendering it with `iPlot`.

Each step includes practical tips on executing cells and ensuring proper configuration to display Plotly graphs seamlessly within Colab notebooks. The process emphasizes copying predefined code snippets into each cell where a plot is generated to ensure smooth integration of Plotly's functionality in the notebook environment.
