The text outlines a process for solving an initial value problem by separating variables in functions of \(y\) and \(x\). Here's a concise summary:

1. **Separation of Variables**: The differential equation separates terms involving \(e^{2y} - y\) on one side and \(\sin(2x)\) on the other.

2. **Trigonometric Identity**: Simplify using the identity \(\sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)\).

3. **Integration**: Transform the equation for integration by dividing terms in the numerator by \(e^y\) and simplifying.

4. **Integration by Parts**: Use integration by parts for the term involving \(y e^{-y}\), selecting \(u = y\) and \(dv = e^{-y} dy\).

5. **Resulting Equation**: An implicit solution is obtained: \(e^y + y + \frac{1}{e^y} = 4 - 2\cos(x)\).

6. **Initial Condition**: Apply the initial condition to solve for the constant \(c_1\), resulting in \(c_1 = 4\).

7. **Implicit Solution**: The solution is implicit, as explicitly solving for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) is not feasible.

8. **Contour Analysis**: Construct a function \(g(x, y)\) to analyze contours where \(g(x, y) = 0\), representing intersections with the xy-plane, though visualizing these curves can be complex.
