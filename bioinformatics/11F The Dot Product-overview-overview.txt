The text provides a method for calculating the angle between a diagonal of a cube and one of its sides using vector mathematics. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Cube Setup**: Consider a cube with unit side lengths aligned along the x, y, and z axes. The vectors representing these axes are \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0, 0) \), \( \mathbf{j} = (0, 1, 0) \), and \( \mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1) \).

2. **Diagonal Vector**: The diagonal from one corner of the cube to the opposite is represented by the vector \( \mathbf{d} = (1, 1, 1) \).

3. **Angle Calculation**:
   - To find the angle between the diagonal vector \( \mathbf{d} \) and the z-axis vector \( \mathbf{k} \), use the dot product formula.
   - The cosine of the angle \( \theta \) is given by:

     \[
     \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{k}}{\|\mathbf{d}\| \|\mathbf{k}\|}
     \]

   - Calculate:
     - Dot product: \( \mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{k} = 1 \)
     - Magnitude of \( \mathbf{d} \): \( \sqrt{3} \)
     - Magnitude of \( \mathbf{k} \): \( 1 \)

   - Thus, 

     \[
     \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

4. **Angle Result**:
   - The angle is \( \theta = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \).

5. **Generalization**: This method can be applied to any cube, regardless of side length, as the calculation remains consistent due to cancellation of scaling factors.

6. **Dot Product and Angles**:
   - The dot product helps determine whether angles are acute (\(0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ\)), obtuse (\(90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ\)), or right (\(\theta = 90^\circ\)).
   - Positive dot products indicate acute angles, negative indicate obtuse angles, and zero indicates perpendicular vectors.

This explanation emphasizes using vector mathematics to find angles in geometric shapes like cubes.
