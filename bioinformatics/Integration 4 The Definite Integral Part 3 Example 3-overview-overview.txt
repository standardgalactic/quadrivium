To calculate the total area between the sine curve \( y = \sin(x) \) and the x-axis over the interval from 0 to \( 2\pi \), you need to consider both positive and negative areas as absolute values. The sine curve has two symmetric parts in this interval: a positive area from 0 to \( \pi \) and an equivalent negative area from \( \pi \) to \( 2\pi \).

1. For the interval from 0 to \( \pi \):
   - Integrate \( \sin(x) \), which gives the antiderivative \(-\cos(x)\).
   - Evaluate: \(-\cos(\pi) - (-\cos(0)) = 1 + 1 = 2\).

2. For the interval from \( \pi \) to \( 2\pi \):
   - Integrate \( \sin(x) \), again giving the antiderivative \(-\cos(x)\).
   - Evaluate: \(-(\cos(2\pi) - \cos(\pi)) = -(1 + 1) = -2\).

Since the area must be positive, take the absolute value of \(-2\), which is \(2\).

The total area between the curve and the x-axis from 0 to \(2\pi\) is the sum of these absolute values: \(2 + 2 = 4\) square units.
