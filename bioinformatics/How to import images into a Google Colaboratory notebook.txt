In this tutorial I want to show you how easy it is to import images into a
co-laboratory notebook. So I'm on my Google Drive here, I've navigated to I
keep my YouTube tutorials and I'm going to simply say new, scroll down to more
and then co-laboratory. After a few seconds it opens a Jupyter notebook for
me. Let's change the name of this notebook. I'm just going to highlight
untitled zero and we're going to say display images as the title for our
Jupyter notebook. So we've got our first cell here and I'm going to import two
things. I'm going to say from google.colab we're going to say import
files. Very important because we're going to use that files to actually import our
image. And then to display the image in a notebook I'm going to say from ipython dot
display import image. So those two lines of code and we're going to use them as I
say to import our image and then to display our image. We'll add a new code
cell and then here we're going to create a computer variable called uploaded and
that is going to be files dot upload files dot upload. So we're going to call
this upload and we can now choose a file. It's going to open the browser that is
put into our operating system and I'm going to choose from one of those files. It's
going to upload now as you can see 0% 18% 35% and there you go 100%. Now you'll
notice it says saving krg logo dot light png to krg logo light space 2. So I've got
two other notebooks open and I've already loaded these logos there and an instance of that will
exist. And it is this name that I now have to use to display whatever it was called during
the upload is what I'm now going to use. So let's use image and inside of image we're now
going to use krg logo light and then to dot png. And I just want to add one more argument because it's a quite a large image that I'm importing here. So it's width. Let's set the width here.
Let's set the width here. In my case to 1200. Let's run that. And there we go. We can see the logo being displayed there beautifully. So that is how you import an image and how you display an image in a co-laboratory Jupyter Notebook.
And there I go.
