The text describes damped harmonic motion, which involves a retarding force proportional to velocity that acts against the movement of an oscillator. This damping is often due to factors like air resistance or internal friction in the spring mechanism. The mathematical model for this system is represented by a second-order differential equation:

\[ x'' + 2\lambda x' + \omega^2 x = 0 \]

In this equation, \( 2\lambda \) equals \( \beta/m \), where \( \beta \) is the damping coefficient and \( m \) is mass. Similarly, \( \omega^2 \) represents \( k/m \).

The behavior of the system under different damping conditions can be categorized into three scenarios based on the nature of the roots of the equation:

1. **Overdamped**: Occurs when the roots are real and distinct (\(\lambda^2 > \omega^2\)), leading to a solution with two negative exponential terms:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 e^{(m_1 t)} + c_2 e^{(m_2 t)}
   \]
   Here, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the distinct real roots.

2. **Critically Damped**: Happens when the roots are real and equal (\(\lambda^2 = \omega^2\)), resulting in a repeated root solution:
   \[
   x(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t) e^{-\lambda t}
   \]

3. **Underdamped**: Arises when the roots are complex conjugates (\(\lambda^2 < \omega^2\)), indicating oscillatory motion with exponential decay:
   \[
   x(t) = e^{-\lambda t} (c_1 \cos(\beta t) + c_2 \sin(\beta t))
   \]
   where \( \beta = \sqrt{\omega^2 - \lambda^2} \).

These scenarios illustrate how the system responds under varying damping conditions, influencing whether it oscillates and the rate at which it returns to equilibrium.
