To find all the fourth roots of \(1\), we can use both algebraic and geometric approaches. Let's go through them step-by-step.

### Algebraic Approach

Firstly, express \(1\) as a complex number:
\[ z = 1 + 0i \]

The modulus of \(z\) is:
\[ |z| = \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 \]

The principal argument (\(\theta\)) of \(z\) is:
\[ \theta = 0 \]

We are looking for the fourth roots, so we set \(n = 4\). The formula for the \(n\)th roots of a complex number is given by:
\[ z_k = |z|^{1/n} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right) \]

For \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\), we calculate:

1. **\(k = 0\):**
   \[
   z_0 = 1^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 0 \times \pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 0 \times \pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   z_0 = 1 \left( \cos(0) + i \sin(0) \right) = 1
   \]

2. **\(k = 1\):**
   \[
   z_1 = 1^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 1 \times \pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 1 \times \pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   z_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = i
   \]

3. **\(k = 2\):**
   \[
   z_2 = 1^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 2 \times \pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 2 \times \pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   z_2 = \cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi) = -1
   \]

4. **\(k = 3\):**
   \[
   z_3 = 1^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 3 \times \pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 3 \times \pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   z_3 = \cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -i
   \]

Thus, the fourth roots of \(1\) are:
\[ 1, \, i, \, -1, \, -i \]

### Geometric Approach

On the complex plane, the number \(1\) is represented as a point on the positive real axis at a distance of \(1\) from the origin. The fourth roots of unity form vertices of a square inscribed in the unit circle.

- Start with \(z_0 = 1\), which lies on the positive x-axis.
- Rotate \(90^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians) counterclockwise to get \(z_1 = i\).
- Another \(90^\circ\) rotation gives \(z_2 = -1\).
- A final \(90^\circ\) rotation results in \(z_3 = -i\).

This confirms the algebraic results: the fourth roots of \(1\) are indeed \(1, \, i, \, -1, \, -i\).

The text explains the process of selecting values for \( k \) to obtain four roots. By setting \( k \) to 1, 2, and 3, they choose \( k = 3 \) to achieve four roots (1, 2, 3, and 4). The concept is described as very simple with no difficulty involved.

To find all the fourth roots of \(1\), we first express \(1\) as a complex number: \(1 + 0i\). This means its modulus is \(r = \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1\), and its argument (or angle with the positive x-axis) is \(\theta = 0\).

We are looking for all solutions to the equation:

\[ z^4 = 1. \]

Using De Moivre's Theorem, we can express these roots in polar form as:

\[ z_k = r^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{4}\right) \right), \]

where \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \).

Since the modulus of \(1\) is \(1\), we have:

\[ r^{1/4} = 1. \]

The principal argument \(\theta = 0\). Thus, each fourth root will be given by:

\[ z_k = \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{4}\right), \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3. \]

Calculating each \(z_k\):

- For \(k = 0\):
  \[
  z_0 = \cos(0) + i \sin(0) = 1 + 0i.
  \]

- For \(k = 1\):
  \[
  z_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0 + i = i.
  \]

- For \(k = 2\):
  \[
  z_2 = \cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi) = -1 + 0i = -1.
  \]

- For \(k = 3\):
  \[
  z_3 = \cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = 0 - i = -i.
  \]

Thus, the fourth roots of \(1\) are:

\[ 1, \, i, \, -1, \, -i. \]

These roots are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane at angles of \(0\), \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\pi\), and \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\) radians from the positive real axis.

The text discusses identifying the four roots of a problem or equation. It suggests using values \( k = 1, 2, \) and \( 3 \), and specifically choosing \( k = 3 \) to obtain four roots: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The speaker emphasizes that this concept is simple and straightforward, without any complexity involved.
