To find all the fourth roots of \(1\), we can use both algebraic and geometric approaches. Let's go through them step-by-step.

### Algebraic Approach

Firstly, express \(1\) as a complex number:
\[ z = 1 + 0i \]

The modulus of \(z\) is:
\[ |z| = \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 \]

The principal argument (\(\theta\)) of \(z\) is:
\[ \theta = 0 \]

We are looking for the fourth roots, so we set \(n = 4\). The formula for the \(n\)th roots of a complex number is given by:
\[ z_k = |z|^{1/n} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right) \]

For \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\), we calculate:

1. **\(k = 0\):**
   \[
   z_0 = 1^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 0 \times \pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 0 \times \pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   z_0 = 1 \left( \cos(0) + i \sin(0) \right) = 1
   \]

2. **\(k = 1\):**
   \[
   z_1 = 1^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 1 \times \pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 1 \times \pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   z_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = i
   \]

3. **\(k = 2\):**
   \[
   z_2 = 1^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 2 \times \pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 2 \times \pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   z_2 = \cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi) = -1
   \]

4. **\(k = 3\):**
   \[
   z_3 = 1^{1/4} \left( \cos\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 3 \times \pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{0 + 2 \times 3 \times \pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]
   \[
   z_3 = \cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -i
   \]

Thus, the fourth roots of \(1\) are:
\[ 1, \, i, \, -1, \, -i \]

### Geometric Approach

On the complex plane, the number \(1\) is represented as a point on the positive real axis at a distance of \(1\) from the origin. The fourth roots of unity form vertices of a square inscribed in the unit circle.

- Start with \(z_0 = 1\), which lies on the positive x-axis.
- Rotate \(90^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians) counterclockwise to get \(z_1 = i\).
- Another \(90^\circ\) rotation gives \(z_2 = -1\).
- A final \(90^\circ\) rotation results in \(z_3 = -i\).

This confirms the algebraic results: the fourth roots of \(1\) are indeed \(1, \, i, \, -1, \, -i\).

The text explains the process of selecting values for \( k \) to obtain four roots. By setting \( k \) to 1, 2, and 3, they choose \( k = 3 \) to achieve four roots (1, 2, 3, and 4). The concept is described as very simple with no difficulty involved.
