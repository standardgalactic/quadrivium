The text explains orthogonality in Euclidean spaces using the dot product as a criterion. In 2D and 3D, two vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) are orthogonal if their dot product is zero (\( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \)). This concept extends to any dimension, such as 4D, 5D, or \( n \)-dimensional spaces. Orthogonal vectors are also referred to as perpendicular.

The text notes a key property of orthogonal vectors: the Pythagorean theorem applies. Specifically, if two vectors are orthogonal, the squared norm of their sum equals the sum of their individual squared norms, expressed mathematically as \( \| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \|^2 = \| \mathbf{u} \|^2 + \| \mathbf{v} \|^2 \). This relationship is unique to orthogonal vectors.
