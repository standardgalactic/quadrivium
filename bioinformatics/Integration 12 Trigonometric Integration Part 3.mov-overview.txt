The text provides an explanation on how to find derivatives of certain trigonometric functions: tangent and secant. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Derivative of Tangent**:
   - The derivative of \( \tan(x) \) is found by rewriting it as the quotient \( \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \).
   - Using the quotient rule, where \( u = \sin(x) \) and \( v = \cos(x) \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \frac{v \cdot u' - u \cdot v'}{v^2} = \frac{\cos(x) \cdot \cos(x) - \sin(x) \cdot (-\sin(x))}{\cos^2(x)}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} = \sec^2(x)
     \]
   - Thus, the derivative of \( \tan(x) \) is \( \sec^2(x) \), which can also be expressed as \( 1 + \tan^2(x) \).

2. **Derivative of Secant**:
   - The derivative of \( \sec(x) \) involves rewriting it as \( \frac{1}{\cos(x)} \).
   - Using the quotient rule, where \( u = 1 \) and \( v = \cos(x) \), we get:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \frac{v \cdot u' - u \cdot v'}{v^2} = \frac{\cos(x) \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot (-\sin(x))}{\cos^2(x)}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \sec(x) \tan(x)
     \]
   - Therefore, the derivative of \( \sec(x) \) is \( \sec(x) \tan(x) \).

These results are essential for understanding trigonometric integration and related calculus problems.

The text discusses trigonometric identities and derivatives, specifically focusing on the secant function. It states that "one over cosine of \( x \)" is equivalent to the secant of \( x \) (\(\sec(x)\)). The first derivative of \(\sec(x)\) is given as \(\tan(x) \times \sec(x)\). Following this explanation, it indicates a transition to exploring integrals involving tangent and secant functions. Additionally, there seems to be a numerical mention "97 of x," but its context or relevance is unclear in the provided text.

The text provides a concise explanation of how to derive the derivatives of two trigonometric functions: tangent and secant.

1. **Derivative of Tangent (\( \tan(x) \)):**
   - Start with expressing \( \tan(x) \) as \( \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \).
   - Use the quotient rule for differentiation, where if \( u = \sin(x) \) and \( v = \cos(x) \), then:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{u}{v}\right) = \frac{v \cdot u' - u \cdot v'}{v^2}
     \]
   - Substitute: \( u' = \cos(x) \) and \( v' = -\sin(x) \).
   - Calculate:
     \[
     \frac{\cos(x) \cdot \cos(x) - \sin(x) \cdot (-\sin(x))}{\cos^2(x)} = \frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}
     \]
   - Use the Pythagorean identity: \( \cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1 \).
   - Simplify to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} = \sec^2(x)
     \]
   - Recognize that \( \sec^2(x) = 1 + \tan^2(x) \).

2. **Derivative of Secant (\( \sec(x) \)):**
   - Express \( \sec(x) \) as \( \frac{1}{\cos(x)} \).
   - Again, use the quotient rule with \( u = 1 \) and \( v = \cos(x) \), where:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{u}{v}\right) = \frac{v \cdot u' - u \cdot v'}{v^2}
     \]
   - Substitute: \( u' = 0 \) and \( v' = -\sin(x) \).
   - Calculate:
     \[
     \frac{\cos(x) \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot (-\sin(x))}{\cos^2(x)} = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)}
     \]
   - Simplify to:
     \[
     \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos(x)} = \tan(x) \sec(x)
     \]

In summary, the derivative of \( \tan(x) \) is \( \sec^2(x) \), and the derivative of \( \sec(x) \) is \( \sec(x) \tan(x) \).

The text explains that the secant of \( x \) is defined as \( 1/\cos(x) \). It further states that the derivative of the secant function, \( \sec(x) \), with respect to \( x \) is given by \( \tan(x) \cdot \sec(x) \). The text then transitions to discussing integrals involving tangent and secant functions in future content. Additionally, there's a mention of something labeled "97 of x", which seems out of context or incomplete in this snippet.
