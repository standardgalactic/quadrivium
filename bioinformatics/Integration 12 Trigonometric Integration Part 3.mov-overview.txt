The text provides an explanation on how to find derivatives of certain trigonometric functions: tangent and secant. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Derivative of Tangent**:
   - The derivative of \( \tan(x) \) is found by rewriting it as the quotient \( \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \).
   - Using the quotient rule, where \( u = \sin(x) \) and \( v = \cos(x) \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \frac{v \cdot u' - u \cdot v'}{v^2} = \frac{\cos(x) \cdot \cos(x) - \sin(x) \cdot (-\sin(x))}{\cos^2(x)}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} = \sec^2(x)
     \]
   - Thus, the derivative of \( \tan(x) \) is \( \sec^2(x) \), which can also be expressed as \( 1 + \tan^2(x) \).

2. **Derivative of Secant**:
   - The derivative of \( \sec(x) \) involves rewriting it as \( \frac{1}{\cos(x)} \).
   - Using the quotient rule, where \( u = 1 \) and \( v = \cos(x) \), we get:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \frac{v \cdot u' - u \cdot v'}{v^2} = \frac{\cos(x) \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot (-\sin(x))}{\cos^2(x)}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \sec(x) \tan(x)
     \]
   - Therefore, the derivative of \( \sec(x) \) is \( \sec(x) \tan(x) \).

These results are essential for understanding trigonometric integration and related calculus problems.

The text discusses trigonometric identities and derivatives, specifically focusing on the secant function. It states that "one over cosine of \( x \)" is equivalent to the secant of \( x \) (\(\sec(x)\)). The first derivative of \(\sec(x)\) is given as \(\tan(x) \times \sec(x)\). Following this explanation, it indicates a transition to exploring integrals involving tangent and secant functions. Additionally, there seems to be a numerical mention "97 of x," but its context or relevance is unclear in the provided text.
