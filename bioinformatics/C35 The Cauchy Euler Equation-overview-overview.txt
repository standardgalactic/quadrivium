The text discusses solving higher-order linear differential equations with non-constant variable coefficients, specifically focusing on the Scalci-Euler equation. These equations are notable because they allow explicit solutions in terms of polynomial or transcendental functions.

For second-order homogeneous Euler equations, the text introduces a solution method assuming \( y = x^m \). By applying the power rule to find derivatives and substituting them back into the equation, one simplifies it to solve for \( m \), leading to a characteristic or auxiliary equation. This approach is practical when each term's power of \( x \) matches its corresponding derivative order.

The domain of \( x \) is considered from 0 to positive infinity. The method provides a simpler alternative to complex techniques like variation of parameters, focusing on finding solutions through the assumed form \( y = x^m \).

When solving second-order polynomial functions (auxiliary equations), three solution types arise based on the roots:

1. **Real and Distinct Roots**: Two distinct real roots result in the solution:
   \[
   y(x) = c_1 x^{m_1} + c_2 x^{m_2}
   \]
   
2. **Real and Equal Roots**: A repeated real root leads to:
   \[
   y(x) = (c_1 + c_2 \ln x) x^m
   \]

3. **Complex Roots**: Complex roots \( m_{1,2} = \alpha \pm \beta i \) give a solution involving trigonometric functions:
   \[
   y(x) = x^\alpha (c_1 \cos(\beta \ln x) + c_2 \sin(\beta \ln x))
   \]

Each root type results in a distinct structure for the equation's solutions.
