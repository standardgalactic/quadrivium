Here we consider the relationship between the sides and angles of a scalene or regular
triangle.
That is one without a right or 90 degree angle.
Take a look at this triangle ABC.
Side A is opposite angle A, side B is opposite angle B and side C is opposite angle C.
Note that we have dropped a line from angle C down to AB, so that it is perpendicular
to AB at point P, dividing our scalene triangle ABC into two right triangles, CAP and CBP.
The length between P and B is X, and therefore the length between A and P is C minus X.
In triangle CBP the sine of B equals H over A, and therefore H equals A sine B.
In triangle CAP the sine of A equals H over B, and therefore H equals B sine A.
Equating the two H values means that A sine B equals B sine A, and rearranging through
algebraic manipulation means that A over sine A equals B over sine B.
Through the concept of symmetry we can add that this also equals C over sine C, and you
can prove this easily by dropping a perpendicular from another corner.
We will use this same triangle in our next video discussing the area of triangles.
