The text outlines a series of nuclear decay problems involving alpha and beta decays to understand particle emissions.

1. **Radon-220 to Lead-208 Decay:**
   - The goal is to determine how many alpha and beta particles are emitted when radon-220 decays into lead-208.
   - Alpha decay reduces the atomic number by 2 and mass number by 4, while beta-negative decay keeps the mass number constant but increases the atomic number by 1 as a neutron transforms into a proton.
   - The difference in mass numbers (220 to 208) is 12 units. To achieve this through alpha decays alone (each reducing the mass by 4), you need three alpha particles, accounting for a reduction of 12 in mass and 6 in atomic number.
   - Since we start with radon-222 (atomic number 86) and end at lead-208 (atomic number 82), an additional increase of 2 in atomic number is needed. This requires two beta-negative decays.

   **Result:** The sequence involves 3 alpha particles and 2 beta-negative particles.

2. **Energy Calculation for Gamma Rays from Uranium-235 Decay:**
   - Given the wavelength (1.14 x 10^-11 meters) of gamma rays emitted, use the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \) to find energy in joules.
   - Convert this energy into mega electron volts using conversion factors (1 eV = 1.60 x 10^-19 J).
   - The calculation results in an energy of approximately 0.109 MeV for each gamma photon.

3. **Energy of Anti-Neutrino from Phosphorus-32 Decay:**
   - In beta-negative decay, phosphorus-32 transforms into sulfur-32 with the emission of a beta particle (electron) and an anti-neutrino.
   - Using atomic mass units, find the difference between the initial and final states including the emitted electron to determine energy release.
   - Subtracting the known kinetic energy of the beta particle (1.2 MeV) from this total energy gives the possible energy for the anti-neutrino as 0.511 MeV.

These calculations illustrate how changes in atomic structure during decay processes can be quantified and understood through particle emissions and energy transformations.

The text describes a process to determine the number of alpha and beta particles produced when radon-220 decays into lead-208 through successive alpha and beta negative decay processes. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Alpha Decay:** Alpha decay reduces the atomic number by 2 and the mass number by 4, resulting in an alpha particle (helium nucleus).

2. **Beta Negative Decay:** Beta negative decay increases the atomic number by 1 while keeping the mass number unchanged, due to the conversion of a neutron into a proton with the emission of an electron.

To solve for the sequence from radon-220 (atomic number 86) to lead-208 (atomic number 82):

- The mass difference is 12 units, indicating four alpha decays (since each alpha decay reduces the mass by 4).
- Four alpha decays reduce the atomic number by 8. Since we only need a reduction of 4 in the atomic number to reach lead (from 86 to 82), two beta negative decays are required to increase the atomic number back up by 2.
  
Thus, the decay sequence involves three alpha decays and two beta negative decays.

Additionally, the text provides solutions for related nuclear physics problems:

1. **Gamma Ray Energy:** For uranium-235 decay emitting gamma rays with a wavelength of \(1.14 \times 10^{-11}\) meters, using the formula \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), the energy is calculated as approximately 0.109 MeV.

2. **Beta Decay and Neutrino Energy:** In the beta negative decay of phosphorus-32 to sulfur-32, an electron is emitted with an energy of 1.20 MeV. The difference in mass-energy between initial and final states (calculated using atomic masses) gives a total available energy of 1.711 MeV. Subtracting the electron's energy leaves approximately 0.511 MeV as the possible energy for the anti-neutrino emitted during this decay.
