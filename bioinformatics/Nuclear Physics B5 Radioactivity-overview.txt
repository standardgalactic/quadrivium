The text outlines a series of nuclear decay problems involving alpha and beta decays to understand particle emissions.

1. **Radon-220 to Lead-208 Decay:**
   - The goal is to determine how many alpha and beta particles are emitted when radon-220 decays into lead-208.
   - Alpha decay reduces the atomic number by 2 and mass number by 4, while beta-negative decay keeps the mass number constant but increases the atomic number by 1 as a neutron transforms into a proton.
   - The difference in mass numbers (220 to 208) is 12 units. To achieve this through alpha decays alone (each reducing the mass by 4), you need three alpha particles, accounting for a reduction of 12 in mass and 6 in atomic number.
   - Since we start with radon-222 (atomic number 86) and end at lead-208 (atomic number 82), an additional increase of 2 in atomic number is needed. This requires two beta-negative decays.

   **Result:** The sequence involves 3 alpha particles and 2 beta-negative particles.

2. **Energy Calculation for Gamma Rays from Uranium-235 Decay:**
   - Given the wavelength (1.14 x 10^-11 meters) of gamma rays emitted, use the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \) to find energy in joules.
   - Convert this energy into mega electron volts using conversion factors (1 eV = 1.60 x 10^-19 J).
   - The calculation results in an energy of approximately 0.109 MeV for each gamma photon.

3. **Energy of Anti-Neutrino from Phosphorus-32 Decay:**
   - In beta-negative decay, phosphorus-32 transforms into sulfur-32 with the emission of a beta particle (electron) and an anti-neutrino.
   - Using atomic mass units, find the difference between the initial and final states including the emitted electron to determine energy release.
   - Subtracting the known kinetic energy of the beta particle (1.2 MeV) from this total energy gives the possible energy for the anti-neutrino as 0.511 MeV.

These calculations illustrate how changes in atomic structure during decay processes can be quantified and understood through particle emissions and energy transformations.
