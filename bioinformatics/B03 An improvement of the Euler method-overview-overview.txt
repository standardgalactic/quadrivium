The text discusses predictor-corrector methods for solving differential equations, enhancing Euler's basic approach. Euler's method approximates solutions using a simple linear step between points, which often underestimates the true solution due to its reliance on the slope from the previous point. To improve this accuracy, the predictor-corrector method is introduced.

This method involves two main steps:

1. **Predict**: Use Eulerâ€™s method to calculate an initial estimate for the next point \((x_1, y_1)\).
2. **Correct**: Calculate a new slope at this predicted point using the differential equation and average it with the original Euler slope. This averaged slope is then used to find a corrected \(y\) value, denoted as \(y_{n+1}^*\).

This process is called an improved Euler's method or second-order method because it uses two slopes for better accuracy. The formula for finding the corrected value involves adding to the previous \(y\)-value a term that combines both the original and predicted slopes.

The key advantage of this approach is its iterative refinement, which reduces error by averaging slopes, leading to solutions that more accurately follow the true curve of the differential equation.
