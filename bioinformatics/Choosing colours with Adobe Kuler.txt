One of the most important parts in designing a website, designing courseware, designing online videos, is to stick to some kind of color scheme.
Everyone knows the red of Coca-Cola, and so everyone must know instantly that they are dealing with something that you created, and you can do that by choosing the correct colors.
A good way to go about it is to go to a website such as this, Adobe Cooler. That's cooler.adobe.com.
You can sign in, as I've already done here. If you've never done this, just create your free account.
When you're brought to this site, you can create your own colors, and what it will do for you is to create five different colors.
And one should probably never go for more than five colors at a time.
It should be the maximum on top of, say, a white background.
What you can do here is just to go to the Explore section.
Under the Explore section, it will load up some themes.
You can choose Popular themes, Most Used, or just Random, and see what someone else has done.
If there's something you like, say, for instance, here, you can just click on the Edit button, for instance, and that will allow you to edit this.
You can grab some of these, drag it around.
If you're a bit concerned that you don't know anything about choosing colors, you can, on this drop-down box, just choose, say, Complementary Colors.
And wherever you go, it will choose from both sides of the color wheel, so that the colors are indeed complementary.
We see that orange and blue, this kind of orange and blue always goes well together.
Once you've signed in, you can hit this button, give it a new name, let's call it Alpha, and you can save it.
Now, that'll always be available under My Themes.
You can also download it, and when you download it, it is available as a .ase file that you can bring into Photoshop or into Illustrator, and use those color swatches in all your designs.
