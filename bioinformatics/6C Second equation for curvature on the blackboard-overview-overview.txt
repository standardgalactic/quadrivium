The text describes deriving the formula for curvature (\(\kappa\)) through vector calculus, focusing on the cross product method:

1. **Cross Product Approach**: The derivation involves the cross product of two acceleration-related vectors:
   - One vector is derived from \( \frac{d^2t}{dt^2} \).
   - The second vector is \( t \times \frac{ds}{dt} \), simplified using unit vector properties and cross product rules.

2. **Simplification**: 
   - The simplification uses the fact that the cross product of identical vectors is zero.
   - Known relationships like \( t \times n = b \) (where \( b \) is a unit vector) aid further simplifications.

3. **Magnitude and Curvature**:
   - By focusing on magnitudes, expressions are reduced to scalar quantities.
   - The curvature formula becomes:
     \[
     \kappa = \frac{\|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|^3}
     \]
   - Here, \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) is the position vector, with \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}''(t) \) as its first and second derivatives.

4. **Conclusion**: The derived curvature formula is both elegant and practical, relying solely on the position vector and its first two derivatives, showcasing the power of vector calculus in expressing geometric properties concisely.
