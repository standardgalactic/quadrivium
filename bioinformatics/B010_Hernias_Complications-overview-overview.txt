The text discusses the potential complications associated with hernias themselves and their surgical repairs. Hernias can lead to discomfort, pain, cosmetic issues, restricted movement, incarceration (where hernia contents cannot be reduced), and strangulation (which affects blood supply). Surgical repair of hernias carries risks such as recurrence of the hernia, wound sepsis (especially in emergency surgeries), graft sepsis from prosthetic mesh infections, injury to surrounding structures during surgery, and seromas or hematomas resulting from dead spaces created by tissue manipulation. Despite these potential complications, they can often be managed with careful surgical planning and diligent post-operative care.
