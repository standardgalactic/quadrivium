Oh I better not fall off these steps. In this video we're going to just do a
couple of problems actually only five and we're going to look at the arc length
of a parametric curve. Now we've looked at I think when you did for single
variable calculus you looked at the length of a curve on some interval and
we're going to generalize that and it becomes very easy when we just deal with
or change them at least to parametric equations. So only five
problems. Just to get the idea the first one's going to be how do we
derive an equation for the the arc length the length of a section of a
parametric curve. And then we're just going to do four problems. These are all
pretty much the same and what you might find in your homework or what you have to
do is just to dig into single variable calculus trying to remember how to do
these problems in single variable calculus of course. So we'll just do a
couple of them just just as I said to get the ball rolling. So we get to the arc
length of a parametric curve and with these problems we really are just going
to well some of them would be easy because we just do derivatives and
integrals of polynomials. Some are going to be more difficult and they might be
forcing you just to remember your single variable calculus and how to do
derivatives and integrals and all the different techniques. So if you are
required to remember all of those these arc length problems are going to be you
know very good for you. If you if you don't have to do them you can use the
Warframe language for instance it's easy to get these derivatives or they might
just be given to you and just a sheet you know with all these with all the
derivatives of transcendental functions etc. But first of all we need to
understand what this what this arc length of a parametric curve is all about
and the way to do that is just to derive an equation for a parametric curve. So in the
notes you'll see we have to we have to be clear about a few things. So we want
this length of the arc over this the length of this parametric curve going
from from a starting point to an end position on this curve and if so so that
means we have this parameter t and we're going from a to b on this parameter. But
then the first derivative of x with respect to t and the first derivative of y
respect to t they've got to be continuous on this interval for this arc. And this
arc can also not intersect itself from the starting to the end position of t
except perhaps at a finite number of points. It can't happen at an infinite
number of points. It's got to be a finite number of points and that must be so
because of the way that we're going to construct this derivation. So we've got this
arc length this part of this parametric curve and let's call it c and it's an
equation of x as an equation of t and y as an equation of t or function of t and
we're going to go from we have this idea that we're going to go from a less than
equal to t less than equal to b. That's our start and end position on this curve. So
we've got to have as I said x and y both are functions of t and their first
derivatives with respect to t they must be continuous on this closed interval and
then as I said the curve cannot intersect itself other than perhaps at a finite
number of points. Because what we're going to do is we're going to take this
this closed interval of ours a to b and we're going to divide that up. Divide and
conquer. Divide and we're going to divide it into equal length sections and we're
going to have divide up into n of these sections. n of these sections. So if we
divided that up into these equal length little bits so if we have our curve there
we're just going to divide it up in these equal little and remember they're all
going to have a specific t value. So what we're going to have here we're going to
start at a and that's at t sub zero for instance and that's going to be less than t
1 and less than t 2 and then all the way less than t n at the end which is b. So
the fact that we can write this delta t is this b minus a divided by n that's how
long each one of these you know how long each one of these are and what really
happens there is or this delta t at least delta t remember that is just if we go
from we subtract t sub i wherever we are now and we subtract from that i minus 1 the
previous point where we were because they all have equal length and that means you know
when we at let's just look at these these these two points where are we at these two
points so when we start so let's just write here when we start what what values of x and
y do we have well the value for x and y what we have at the start that's going to
be x of t and that's going to be at i minus 1 and we're going to be at y of t i minus 1
that's where we start and we're going to end our x and y where we end well that's
going to be x of t at this i position and y of t at this i position that's where we start
and that's where we end now if you think about it if we zoom in very closely that's this curve
running there but we have you know we have an x delta x and a delta y for that and because these
are very small we're sort of approximating that by a straight line there we're approximating that
by a straight line and you know because we're making these very very small and if we do that
we can make use of just the pythagorean theorem because it's this length squared plus this length
squared and we just take the square root of that and we get the length of the hypotenuse
so we can really say as let's just take one of these little segments and we call its arc length
as si that's the one we're dealing with so that's going to be approximately equal to depending on
how small this little segment is that's the square root of the one side squared and the other side
squared so when we go from x we will go from there to there in other words we're going from there
from this one to this one so it's just the difference of those two squared so let's put it in this order
so that's going to be the x of t sub i minus x of t sub i minus one and we square that and we're going
to do exactly the same for for the y so the delta y in other words it's y of t sub i minus y of t sub i
minus one and we square all of that so we just made use there of the pythagorean theorem just going from
this in position to the start position and we just use the linear process approximation here because
it's very small and that piece of the curve there is very close and that's why we also don't want this
finite number of intersections and as much as we can divide this curve up into bits so that we
incorporate these intersections so what we have to remember here and that's the sort of the big jump
here is just the the this mean value theorem and that says look if i've got this curve going here
and i connect the start and the end position that gives me a slope somewhere along the line there's lots
of slopes here along the line somewhere along the line we've got to have this equality between
this slope here connecting the two and the slope right there somewhere along the line at some point
and we're going to call that point c sub i so we're going to have this fact that dx dt
dx dt at this point c i at this point c i that is going to be this delta x divided by delta t
at that point and that's you know going from start to end so that's going to be x of t sub i minus x of t
sub i minus one the previous one and we divide that by delta t just this little gap that we have
and that means we can sort of rewrite this as the x of t sub i minus the x of t sub i minus one
and that is just going to equal dx dt at c sub at the c sub i so let's just write that as x prime because
that becomes very difficult x prime at that very little point delta t so that was just going to be
some it's just some algebra so i'm just taking this delta t over to the other side
and what we'll see is as far as dy dt is concerned if we do dy dt we're going to get exactly the same
thing but instead of it being at one point c sub i it's going to be at some other point so let's just
make a d sub i so we're going to get this exact same thing that y of t sub t sub i minus y of t sub i
minus one that's going to be y prime of let's make a di delta t for that same sort of the same argument
but now if delta t goes to zero if if it approaches zero these become so small that ci and di they're going
to coincide they're going to be they're going to coincide so i can just rewrite this i can rewrite
all of this as this si that is going to equal and instead of using this one squared and this one
squared as we used it there we're going to just use this we're going to say uh x prime at c sub i
delta t and remember that's all squared and then we're going to have y prime and instead of c sub i
i can put d sub i can put c sub i and delta t and this is all going to be squared so just squaring all
of those and then it's easy to see that we can take a delta t out as a common factor delta t squared
and the square root of delta t though that's just delta t so what we're going to have here is s sub i
it's going to be approximately equal to so we're going to have this x prime at c sub i and that's
all squared plus y prime at c sub i and that's all squared and that's the square root of that
oh that's so ugly let's do this so it's all of that delta t because we had a delta t squared there
delta t squared we took that out as a common factor it is the square root of a square and that just leaves
us with that so what we all we have to do now is just sum up all of these to get all of these little
segments we just sum them up and if we sum them up s it's still going to be approximately equal to but
now we're just summing all of the all of these so we're going to have i equals one to n over all of
them square root of x prime c sub i squared plus c prime at c sub i squared delta t and we can easily
go from there we can easily go from there to the integral because we're summing over these small
things so we just need this limit as n goes to infinity so the arc length then is this going to be
this limit as n goes to infinity we just have infinite number of these little segments of this
of this of this summation here so of this summation the sum of i equals one to n of the square root of
x sub i at c sub i remember all of that is squared and y prime c sub i all of that is squared delta t
t and the limit as n goes to infinity of all of this remember that becomes the integral there
and from our starting position to our ending position and now the c sub i at that this is now so small
as the as n goes to infinity on this delta t goes to zero it becomes so small that that point c sub c sub i
well that's just at every point t so we can just have the square root of now x prime let's just write
it out as dx dt squared plus dy dt squared dt that's just in the limit and as i say we go from the c to the t
there because these little line segments are so short we're taking the we're taking the derivative there
with respect to t at every one of those little points so just on top of each other basically
and that is it that is the equation for the arc length very simple the arc length of a parametric
curve going from start to an end positions the definite integral going from the start to the finish
of the square root and we just square the first derivative of x with respect to t and we square the
first derivative of y with respect to t you know we just square them add them take the square root of all
of that dt and it's as simple as that now that we know what this equation is and let's just write it
down the more you write it down the more that you can remember that so that's s that's our arc length
that's going to be the square root of dx dt all squared plus dy dt all squared and that's the integral remember
going from a to b and there's my ruler
dt so it's as simple as that so the first thing we need to do let's just do some side work
so we need to know what dx dt is in this first problem dx dt and we can see that that is the
equation of a circle if you pop this parametric equation into the wolfram language you're going to
see that on on our parameters theta in this instance but we have this interval for theta being from zero to
two pi so let's just do that that's going to be minus r times the sine of theta and if we do dy dt
that is going to be r times the cosine of theta and if we square these dx dt should make my x is a
bit better that's going to be r squared sine squared of theta and if we do dy dt and we square that that's
going to be r squared and we have cosine squared of theta great so let's do let's tackle the problem
so the arc length is then going to be the definite integral and going from zero to two
pi of the square root and we have r squared sine squared of theta plus r squared cosine squared of
theta d theta d theta what am i writing dt for our problem is the moment is d theta theta here is our
parameter for this parametric equation so s is going to be the definite integral going from zero to two
pi and i see i think you can see let's just do another color again we're going to take under the
square root sine we're going to take our squared out as a common factor and then we're going to have
cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta and we know that from the trigonometric identities that's
just equal to one and we have the square root of r squared and that's just r good and you can see where
this is going to go so what we have at the moment here is just r d theta we just have r d theta and
now what we have to do is we can take the r out because it's not part of the integral it is just a
constant d theta and that is just equal to r and then theta but theta going from zero to two pi
and that is r of two pi minus zero and that is just two pi r so the length of a circle in other words
the circumference of a circle is two pi r and that's where the equation comes from from for the
circumference of a circle let's calculate the length of this parametric curve half t squared that's our x
and then for y we have one over nine six t plus nine to the power three over two and then t goes
from zero to four plot that in the wolfram language and you can see what this parametric curve looks
like first of all let's just remember what our equation is for the arc length of a parametric curve so
that's the definite integral going from a to b of the square root of dx dt all squared plus dy dt
all squared dt and we just have to close down our square root symbol there so once again let's have a
look at this what is dx dt well dx dt as far as x concerned two comes to the front so that is just
going to equal t this is going to equal t and if we square that that is going to be t squared and dy dt
is a bit more involved we have three over two which we now have to bring to the to the front so we're
going to have one over nine we're going to multiply that by three over two and we're going to have 60
plus nine and three over two minus two over two that's one over two and by the chain rule we still
have to have a six there because we still have to integrate the inside expression so dy dt
so it's a bit more involved we can cancel out the three there and this becomes a three and then we
have six divided by six because three times two three times two is six times that six is six times
a six that's just one so we have here in effect the square root of 60 plus nine because it's to the
power half and if we square that dy dt squared that's going to be 60 plus nine so we can eventually
start doing our problem here so we're going to say the arc length is going to be this definite integral
in going from and going from zero to four and what we have for x squared plus y squared so all of this is
still square root so that's going to be t squared plus six t plus nine and there's my ruler and then dt
well if we look at it what is t squared plus six t plus nine well that's just going to be t plus three
squared and the square root of t plus three squared well that's just t plus three so when it comes to our
s here our arc length that is going to be zero to four t plus three dt problem becomes becomes really
simple so if we do that so if we do that that's going to be a half t squared plus three t and we're
going to go from zero to four we can forget the zero because we've got two t's there so that's going to
be zero plus zero so arc length is going to be a half four squared plus three times four and four squared is
16 divided by two is eight and three times four is 12 so our arc length is 20. so this is just a nice
exercise in a bit of simple algebra and just remembering what the equation is for the arc length
problem number four calculate the arc length of the parametric equation x comma y equals the cosine of t
plus t times the sine of t and then the sine of t minus t times the cosine of t and we've got this
interesting interval for our parameter goes from pi over six to pi over four so the reason why we're
doing all these problems to write down these equations until they become second nature so the arc length is
going to be the definite integral and going from a to b square root of dx dt all squared plus dy dt all squared
and we close our square root symbol there all of that with respect to t so let's do some side work
let's just have a look at what dx dt is going to look like so dx dt we have cosine of t there that's first
derivative with respect to t is negative the sine of t and then we add to that now we have to make use of
the product rule so let's keep t first and then take the derivative of sine t with respect to t that's
just cosine of t and then we're going to keep the sine of t but we take the first derivative of t with
respect to t that's just one so we're left with sine of t and then very nicely for us let's take another
color just to show negative sine of t positive sine of t so that's very nice and if we square dx dt
that just means it's t squared plus cosine squared of t let's look at have a look at dy dt
so dy dt we have the sine of t first derivative of that with respect to t is the cosine of t then
we have a minus sign so let's just keep that separate so let's keep the t and then differentiate
cosine of t so that's negative sine of t so that becomes negative t sine of t and then the other way
around we're going to keep cosine of t take the first derivative of t with respect to t that just
leaves us with the cosine of t and so if we write this out that's going to be the cosine of t
minus times minus is positive t sine of t and we have negative the cosine of t and again again that's
very nice because we have cosine of t negative cosine of t that's the way this problem was designed
so if we square this we're just going to be left with t squared plus sine squared of t
so let's get some work done so we're going to have the arc length that's going to be the definite
integral going from pi over six to pi over four again draw that curve in the warframe language you
can see what it looks like and that's going to be the square root of t squared cosine squared of t
plus t squared sine squared of t and i think you can immediately see what's going to happen there
let's just close our square root symbol there let's just do it on the side so if we have the
square root we're going to take t squared out as a common factor and we're left with cosine squared of t
plus sine squared of t and that's a trigonometric identity remember which is just one so we're left
with the square root of t squared and this is t so that makes life very simple for us so we're going
to have arc length is going to be this definite integral and going from pi over six to pi over four
and that's just going to be t all of that just becomes t dt and if we take the integral of that
that's going to be a half t squared and we have to go from pi over six to pi over four so that's going to
be a half and what do we have we have pi squared over four squared oh what am i writing now pi
pi over four pi squared over four squared and we subtract from that pi squared over six squared so
that's still going to be this half that we have and we have pi squared over 16 minus pi squared over 36
and so we have to have a common factor there and i think i did it before that's going to be 100
144 times the half that we have to have there and that leaves us with check just check that it's
correct five pi squared divided by 288 there we go so again this is just a just a friendly exercise
and doing these very simple integrals and i'm going to do one more problem and what you're going to see
is with your problems doing this arc length you're just going to get more and more complicated
single variable calculus problems you're going to have single variable integration and it's going to
become more and more complex and you might have to do that or you might you know just use the orphan
language to do those different those integrals for you or you'll just have to remember all the
techniques that we do have to get these definite integrals calculate the arc length of the
parametric curve x comma y that's half times the natural log of one plus t squared and then the
inverse tangent or arc tangent function of t over the interval for this parameter t going from zero to one
as always just do it every time you do these exercises arc length is the definite integral and
going from the a to b and that is a there remember that's b there of the square root of dx dt all squared
plus dy dt and that's all squared and we close our square root symbol there dt and now we just have to do
some side work let's have a look at what dx dt is dx dt and that's why i said these problems are now going to
become that you just have to remember what your first variable calculus single variable calculus
was was all about and how do we take the derivative first derivative of the natural log of something
with respect to to your variable and if we just have a look at doing this dx dt and you'll remember that
we have the half out in the front that's just a constant and as far as the natural log of something
is going to concerns so for instance what is the natural log of x so natural log of x first derivative
of that with respect to x well that's going to be 1 over x so this is going to be 1 over and the x here
was this t squared plus 1 or 1 plus t squared and with a chain rule we just have to remember that we
still have to do we still have to do the inside function and that's just going to give us a 2t
so if we put all of that together the 2s are going to go so i'm left with t over t squared plus 1 or 1
plus t squared and remember we have to square that so we have to square all of that let's look at dy dt
so the first derivative of the inverse tangent of t so the first derivative of the inverse tangent of t
with respect to t well that's very simple if you remember your arc tangent derivatives that's just
going to be 1 over 1 plus t squared or t squared plus 1 and if we square that we have to square that
so that's why i say these problems are just going to be either they're going to give you this in the
exam or you just have to remember sort of these single variable calculus derivatives and how to
do the derivatives and the integrals so that's going to go from we have 0 to 1 and we have the square
root of that squared plus that squared so that's just going to be t over t squared plus 1 all of that
squared and then we're going to have 1 over t squared plus 1 all of that squared dt so we have this common
denominator here so let's just do that on the side as well so we've got this t squared plus 1 all squared
as the common denominator and so that's just going to be on the top we have a t squared plus 1
and now we can cancel one of them out so that will go and that will go and that will just be 1 so that's
1 over t squared plus 1 and i think you remember those kind of substitutions so that goes from 0 to 1
so we still we are still left with the square root symbol here so that's 1 over t squared plus 1
and close our square root symbol there why am i writing d theta i don't know where that d theta came
from dt of course well i suppose it comes from the fact that we now have to do some substitutions so let's
do that so let's say t equals the tangent of theta remember those substitutions when we have 1 over
x squared plus 1 so d dt d theta so we're going to have dt d theta remember what that's going to be
what is the first derivative of the tangent of a function well that's the secant squared of that
function so we have the fact that dt is now the secant squared of theta d theta so we're just bringing
that d theta over to the other side so we can replace that or substitute that dt
and all we have to remember now what you can do otherwise you can bring it back is just to say
what is going to be when is the tangent of theta going to equal zero because we're going from zero to
one remember so we just want to replace those well that happens when theta equals zero and when is the
tangent of theta equal to one well that's when theta equals pi over four remember so we can replace
those so we can now say the arc length is going from zero to pi over four we've got a slightly
different blue color here and now we have this one over and we have this um sequence or remember t is now
the tangent of of of of t so that's going to be the tangent squared plus one remember this um
um this t here we're just replacing that and then dt we're replacing this is close there dt we're
replacing with a secant squared secant squared d theta so now it's this whole problem in theta
so we are fortunate here because we remember that the tangent squared of an angle the tangent squared of an
angle plus one well that's just the secant squared of that angle so we have one over the secant squared
but the square root of all of that oops that would be totally the wrong color let's just go back so
this is going to be this definite integral and going from zero to pi over four so it's one over secant
squared but the square root of all of that so that's just one over secant but we've got secant
squared of theta there so let me just write it out sequence squared of theta forgive me for leaving
out these parameters so there should be a theta there as well over secant or theta d theta but that
is just the different integral going from zero to pi over four of the secant of the secant without the
square the secant of theta d theta and now you'll just have to remember what that is and if you do
remember what that is that's going to be the absolute the natural log of the absolute value
of the secant i can't write today secant of theta plus the tangent of theta okay and all of this has
got to go from zero to pi over four so that leaves us with the natural log of the absolute value of so what
is the secant of pi over four that's square root of two that's going to be square root of two
and then plus a tan of that so the tangent of that that's one and we're going to subtract from that the
natural log of the absolute value of if we put zero in there we're just left with we're just left with
one and because this is a negative remember we can also just divide those so s is going to be
this natural log of the absolute value or then the positive square root of two plus one you can
just write that as natural log of the square root of two and it's just the positive one that we're
taking plus one and there you go so this all your other problems you're basically going to see that
it all boils down to can you remember your single variable calculus so as i mentioned it's either going
to be given to you or you'll just have to remember these and if you have to remember your single
variable calculus how to do derivatives and integrals of that these problems are good and just to do
your exercises to remember all those techniques of getting the derivative and the integral so that's
it for these five problems and arc length quite a bit of fun and of course it has a lot of real world uses
to calculate the the arc length of a parametric curve
so
