Good, we're back here in the Julia box and you see the little home page there and you
can see I think it happened already right at the end of the next section it loaded my
file structure so these are the files that I already have folders I should say that I
already have on my Julia box it works just like a hard drive on your computer but it
lives in the cloud and how you can make these little folders or folders with inside of folders
you just say new folder and oh server error that's phenomenal that's a good start let's try
again new folder there we go it makes or it did it twice so there was a little hiccup no problems
there you don't have when you create a new folder like that you don't have the control over what
you call the folder but what we do have is the following I can click on that and we see a little
rename and delete button appears let's delete that folder which happened twice now this folder
I'm going to click on that and I'm going to rename that folder just call it a new folder new folder
hit enter or return and there we have now we seem to have quite a bit of server errors at the moment
it just might it's just a connection issue I'm just going to hit this little reload button there and
there we go we see a new folder there I can click that one my new folder there's another folder I made
previously I can just delete both of those no problem another little error we just sink of that
now unfortunately that's just how it seems to go this morning but certainly that's not the norm you
shouldn't worry about these things at all the one folder that I've already created contains our first
lesson there's the lectures on Julia so if I click on that obviously that folder opens up I can see
the folder structure and I can go back home or I'm in this folder now once I'm in this folder I can click
new and start a new notebook so if I start a new notebook we see that this tab opens up and it's going
to download from the internet a new clean notebook and this is what it looks like you can see the Julia
kernel starting up there please wait kernel is now ready we can write a Julia file in Julia version 0.3.11
so let's just get familiar with this up top here it says untitled once again I can click on that and
say my new file so it just has a name so it's a file that lives there now and these are the code blocks
inside of these little blocks I can write my code and I can execute my code so we'll learn what all of
these are about one that you can look out for now is just the save button if you've written some lines
of code it will just save that for you once again I seem to have a very bad connection today it's not
going to do much for me for the next bit of these lessons I'll try to reboot the system these are where
you write your lines of code very easy to see though this little drop down box each of these little cells
can be either lines of code or lines of markdown we won't worry about these two markdown is where you
just write normal text I can write a normal line of text they're executed and it will look like a web
page with nice text on it I can even format this text using either markdown or HTML normal HTML code
that I can put into these little cells and I can have nice words in between my lines of code and this is
what is referred to as a notebook this is a Jupiter notebook running right inside it didn't have to
install Jupiter notebooks I did not have to install Julia I'm running everything right here so in the
next section we're going to start our first look at the actual language which is what you're here for
