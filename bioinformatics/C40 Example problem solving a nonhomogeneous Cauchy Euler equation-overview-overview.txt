The text provides a step-by-step method for solving a non-homogeneous differential equation using variation of parameters. Here's a summary:

1. **Homogenization**: Start by transforming the given non-homogeneous differential equation into its associated homogeneous form, which involves identifying and solving it to find characteristic roots.

2. **Complementary Solution**: Use these roots (in this case, \( r = 0 \) and \( r = 1 \)) to construct the complementary solution, resulting in \( y_c = c_1 + c_2x \).

3. **Particular Solution via Variation of Parameters**:
   - Calculate the Wronskian determinant from the solutions of the homogeneous equation.
   - Determine functions \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) by solving integrals based on the non-homogeneous part of the original equation.

4. **Integration Process**: Perform integration to explicitly find \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \), using techniques like integration by parts if necessary.

5. **Final Solution Construction**: Combine the complementary solution \( y_c \) with the particular solution \( y_p \) to form the general solution of the original differential equation.

6. **Key Advice**: The method emphasizes first converting the non-homogeneous equation into a homogeneous one, solving it, and then applying variation of parameters to find the particular solution, ensuring correct handling of the forcing function for calculating necessary integrals.

Overall, this guide focuses on systematically addressing second-order linear differential equations with variable coefficients using these mathematical techniques.
