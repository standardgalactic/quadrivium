The text introduces methods for solving ordinary first-order linear differential equations where the rate of change of a variable is proportional to the variable itself, represented by the equation \( \frac{dy}{dt} = ky \). Two primary solution techniques are discussed:

1. **Homogeneous Linear Equations with an Integrating Factor**: This method involves rearranging the equation into standard form and using an integrating factor (\( e^{-kt} \)) to simplify it. By multiplying through by this factor, the left side of the equation is transformed into a derivative that can be easily integrated.

2. **Separation of Variables**: In this approach, variables are separated so that terms involving \( y \) are on one side and those involving \( t \) are on the other. Integrating both sides leads to an exponential solution: \( y = Ce^{kt} \), where \( C \) is a constant determined by initial conditions.

Both methods result in the same general solution, demonstrating different techniques for solving linear differential equations. The constant \( C \) is crucial as it often relates to initial conditions and is significant in applications involving growth or decay over time.
