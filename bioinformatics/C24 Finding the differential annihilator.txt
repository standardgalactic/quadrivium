So if we look at this problem, we will note that, just think about the fact that there's an x to the power 0 here as well, that means n equals 1, n should equal 1, and alpha here is negative 1 and beta equals 2.
So if we do write out our solution, remember that that should be d squared, and then alpha is negative 1 times, remember as far as the solution goes, that will have to then be a positive 2d, then alpha squared plus beta squared, that will be plus 5, plus 5.
And n is equal to 1 of all of this, of all of that should equal 0.
So it doesn't matter that 1 is cosine and 1 is a sine, these annihilating operators really gets rid of both, remember, let me just write it down,
remember that was d squared minus 2 alpha d plus alpha squared plus beta squared or beta squared, and if we just get this, that was the annihilating differential operator.
For any of the functions where, well, I should actually just say to the power n, and remember here, x was to the power 0, but that's actually an n minus 1 there.
So n minus 1 equals 0, thus n equals 1, so that was 1, so that just left this to the power 1, which is this as my annihilating operator, irrespective of the fact whether that's cosine and sine and whether they were mixed, it works for both.
