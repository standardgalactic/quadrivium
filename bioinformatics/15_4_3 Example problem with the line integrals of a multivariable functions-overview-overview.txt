The text describes evaluating a line integral over a composite curve \( C \) made up of two segments, \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \), focusing on integrating with respect to the \( x \)-direction. Here's a summary:

**Curve \( C_1 \):**
- It starts at (2, 0, 2) and ends at (0, 1, 0).
- Parametrized by:
  - \( x(t) = 2 - 2t \)
  - \( y(t) = t \)
  - \( z(t) = 2 - 2t \)
  - For \( t \) in [0, 1].
- The derivative with respect to \( t \) is:
  - \( x'(t) = -2 \), \( y'(t) = 1 \), \( z'(t) = -2 \).
- Function for integration: \( f(x, y, z) = 3x + 2y + z \).
- Substituting the parameterization into \( f \):
  - \( f(r(t)) = 6 - 6t + 8 = 14 - 6t \).
- The integral becomes:
  - \(\int_0^1 (14 - 6t)(-2) \, dt\), which evaluates to \(-10\).

**Curve \( C_2 \):**
- A quarter circle at \( x = 0 \) from (0, 1, 0) to (0, 0, 1).
- Parameterized as:
  - \( x = 0 \)
  - \( y = \cos(t) \)
  - \( z = \sin(t) \)
  - For \( t \) in [0, \(\pi/2\)].
- Since \( dx/dt = 0 \), the integral in the \( x \)-direction is zero.

The overall line integral over both curves is determined by the contribution from \( C_1 \), which is \(-10\). The contribution from \( C_2 \) is zero due to no change in \( x \). Thus, the total result for the line integral along the entire curve \( C \) is \(-10\).
