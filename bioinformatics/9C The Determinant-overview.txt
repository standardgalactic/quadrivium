The text discusses a specific property related to determinants of matrices. It highlights that generally, the determinant of the sum of two matrices \(A + B\) does not equal the sum of their individual determinants, \(\det(A) + \det(B)\). However, an exception exists under certain conditions: if matrices \(A\) and \(B\) differ by only one row or one column, then the determinant of their sum can be expressed as the sum of their individual determinants. Specifically, matrix \(C = A + B\) must have identical rows or columns with one differing row or column being the addition of those in \(A\) and \(B\).

The text provides an example where this property is verified by calculating the determinants using cofactor expansion. It shows that under these conditions, \(\det(A) + \det(B) = \det(C)\).

Additionally, it briefly touches on a fundamental concept in linear algebra: if a square matrix \(A\) is invertible, its determinant must be non-zero. This property links the concepts of determinants and matrix invertibility.

The text discusses properties related to invertible matrices in linear algebra. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Determinant and Invertibility**: If the determinant of matrix \( A \) is 0, then \( A \) is not invertible.

2. **Trivial Solution**: For a square matrix \( A \), if \( Ax = 0 \) (where \( x \) is a column vector), the only solution is the trivial one (\( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \ldots = 0 \)) if and only if \( A \) is invertible.

3. **Reduced Row Echelon Form**: An invertible square matrix can be transformed into an identity matrix of the same size through row operations, indicating it has a reduced row echelon form (RREF) as the identity matrix.

4. **Elementary Matrices**: Any invertible matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices, which are derived from the identity matrix by performing a single elementary row operation.

5. **Solutions for \( Ax + b \)**: If \( A \) is an invertible square matrix, then the equation \( Ax + b = 0 \) has exactly one solution for every column vector \( b \), ensuring consistency in solutions across different values of \( b \).

The text emphasizes that invertibility guarantees a unique solution to linear systems and connects this with concepts like elementary matrices and row operations.

The text discusses a specific property related to determinants of matrices. It highlights that while you cannot generally assert that the determinant of matrix \(A + B\) equals the sum of the determinants of \(A\) and \(B\), there are special cases where this can be true. Specifically, if two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) differ by only one row or column, then the determinant of their sum equals the sum of their individual determinants when a third matrix \(C\) is constructed such that it combines the identical rows/columns from \(A\) and \(B\) and takes the differing row/column as the sum of those in \(A\) and \(B\).

The text provides an example to illustrate this property, demonstrating calculations of determinants using cofactor expansion for matrices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). It shows that if \( \text{det}(A) = -10 \), \( \text{det}(B) = -14 \), then \( \text{det}(C) = -24 \), confirming the property since \( C\) is constructed according to the described rules.

Additionally, it notes a fundamental aspect of linear algebra: if an \(N \times N\) matrix \(A\) is invertible, its determinant must be non-zero. This condition ensures that the matrix has full rank and a unique inverse.

The text discusses properties related to square matrices, particularly focusing on invertibility and solutions to linear equations. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Invertibility and Determinants**: A matrix \( A \) is not invertible if its determinant is zero.

2. **Trivial Solution for Homogeneous Systems**: For a homogeneous system \( Ax = 0 \), where \( A \) is an invertible square matrix, the only solution is the trivial one (i.e., all components of \( x \) are zero).

3. **Reduced Row Echelon Form**: If \( A \) is invertible, its reduced row echelon form is the identity matrix of size \( n \), where \( n \) is the number of rows/columns in \( A \).

4. **Elementary Matrices**: An invertible square matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices. Elementary matrices are derived from identity matrices by applying a single elementary row operation.

5. **Uniqueness of Solutions for Non-Homogeneous Systems**: If \( A \) is an invertible matrix, then the equation \( Ax + b = 0 \) has exactly one solution for every column vector \( b \). This implies that such systems are consistent and will always have a unique solution.

6. **Consistency**: A system of equations is consistent if there is at least one set of values (solution) satisfying all equations. For invertible matrices, the system \( Ax + b = 0 \) guarantees this consistency with exactly one solution per \( b \).

The text intertwines these mathematical concepts to explain properties and implications related to linear algebra, particularly focusing on the behavior of square matrices in systems of linear equations.
