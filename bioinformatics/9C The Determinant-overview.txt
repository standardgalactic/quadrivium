The text discusses a specific property related to determinants of matrices. It highlights that generally, the determinant of the sum of two matrices \(A + B\) does not equal the sum of their individual determinants, \(\det(A) + \det(B)\). However, an exception exists under certain conditions: if matrices \(A\) and \(B\) differ by only one row or one column, then the determinant of their sum can be expressed as the sum of their individual determinants. Specifically, matrix \(C = A + B\) must have identical rows or columns with one differing row or column being the addition of those in \(A\) and \(B\).

The text provides an example where this property is verified by calculating the determinants using cofactor expansion. It shows that under these conditions, \(\det(A) + \det(B) = \det(C)\).

Additionally, it briefly touches on a fundamental concept in linear algebra: if a square matrix \(A\) is invertible, its determinant must be non-zero. This property links the concepts of determinants and matrix invertibility.

The text discusses properties related to invertible matrices in linear algebra. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Determinant and Invertibility**: If the determinant of matrix \( A \) is 0, then \( A \) is not invertible.

2. **Trivial Solution**: For a square matrix \( A \), if \( Ax = 0 \) (where \( x \) is a column vector), the only solution is the trivial one (\( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \ldots = 0 \)) if and only if \( A \) is invertible.

3. **Reduced Row Echelon Form**: An invertible square matrix can be transformed into an identity matrix of the same size through row operations, indicating it has a reduced row echelon form (RREF) as the identity matrix.

4. **Elementary Matrices**: Any invertible matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices, which are derived from the identity matrix by performing a single elementary row operation.

5. **Solutions for \( Ax + b \)**: If \( A \) is an invertible square matrix, then the equation \( Ax + b = 0 \) has exactly one solution for every column vector \( b \), ensuring consistency in solutions across different values of \( b \).

The text emphasizes that invertibility guarantees a unique solution to linear systems and connects this with concepts like elementary matrices and row operations.
