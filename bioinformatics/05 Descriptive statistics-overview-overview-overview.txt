The text describes how to perform basic descriptive statistics in SPSS for both numerical and categorical data. For numerical variables like age or heart rate, it explains calculating statistical measures including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range. When dealing with categorical data, the text suggests using cross-tabulation (Cross Tabs) to create matrices that show counts of outcomes based on categories such as diabetes status versus patient outcome (survived/died). Additionally, it recommends further analysis by dividing data into subgroups to compare specific metrics, for instance, comparing ages between survivors and non-survivors.
