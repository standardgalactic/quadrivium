The text describes solving a second-order linear differential equation using the reduction of order technique when one solution is already known. Given that \( y_1 = e^x \) is a solution, the goal is to find another linearly independent solution to form the general solution.

The process involves assuming the second solution has the form \( y = u(x)e^x \). By substituting this into the differential equation and applying differentiation using the product rule, it simplifies to a first-order linear differential equation in terms of the derivative of \( u \), denoted as \( u' \).

Solving this reduced first-order equation through separation of variables leads to an expression for \( u(x) \) involving an exponential function. The integration results in another solution, \( e^{-x} \).

Thus, the general solution of the differential equation is given by \( y = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. The solutions \( e^x \) and \( e^{-x} \) are confirmed to be linearly independent, completing the process of finding the general solution.

The text also hints at a moment of realization or achievement with phrases like "And lo and behold," suggesting an unexpected discovery or conclusion in the problem-solving journey. However, without further context, the specific nature of this realization remains unclear.
