The provided texts discuss fundamental concepts related to vectors, their arithmetic properties, norms (or lengths), and geometric interpretations in both two- and three-dimensional spaces. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Vector Arithmetic**:
   - Vectors follow commutative (\( \mathbf{U} + \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V} + \mathbf{U} \)) and associative properties, allowing flexible grouping in addition.
   - The identity element is the zero vector, as adding it to any vector does not change that vector (\( \mathbf{U} + 0 = \mathbf{U} \)).
   - Each vector has an inverse (negative), such that adding a vector to its negative results in the zero vector (\( \mathbf{U} + (-\mathbf{U}) = 0 \)).

2. **Distributive Property**:
   - Scalars can be distributed over vector addition, expressed as \( K(\mathbf{U} + \mathbf{V}) = K\mathbf{U} + K\mathbf{V} \).

3. **Norm (Length) of a Vector**:
   - In 2D space, the norm is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: \( \|\mathbf{V}\| = \sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2} \).
   - For vectors not starting at the origin, calculate by subtracting coordinates of the tail from the head.
   - In 3D space, extend this to three components: \( \|\mathbf{V}\| = \sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2} \).

4. **Effect of Scalar Multiplication on Norm**:
   - The norm of a scalar multiple of a vector is the absolute value of the scalar times the norm: \( \|K\mathbf{V}\| = |K|\|\mathbf{V}\| \).
   - Norms are always positive, regardless of direction.

5. **Example with Trigonometry**:
   - For a 2D vector \( \mathbf{V} = (V_1, V_2) \), components can be expressed using trigonometric functions: 
     - \( V_1 = \|\mathbf{V}\| \cos(\theta) \).

6. **Geometric Interpretation in 3D**:
   - Involves describing points in three-dimensional space such that the norm of the vector difference between two points equals a specific value (e.g., 1).
   - This condition describes all points forming a sphere with radius 1 centered at a given point \( P_0 \).

7. **Equation for Sphere**:
   - The equation representing this sphere is: 
     - \((x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 = 1\)

Overall, the texts emphasize vector operations, their norms, and how these concepts extend to geometric representations like spheres in three-dimensional space.
