The text explains line integrals with respect to \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates in a plane, contrasting them with line integrals with respect to arc length (\(ds\)). Key points include:

1. **Parametrization**: A curve is described by a vector function \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))\).

2. **Derivatives and Differentials**: Derivatives \(x'(t)\) and \(y'(t)\) are computed, leading to differentials \(dx = x'(t) dt\) and \(dy = y'(t) dt\).

3. **Integral Expression**:
   - For a function \(f(x, y)\), the line integral with respect to \(x\) is \(\int f(\mathbf{r}(t)) x'(t) dt\).
   - With respect to \(y\), it is \(\int f(\mathbf{r}(t)) y'(t) dt\).

4. **Direction Sensitivity**: Unlike arc length integrals, these integrals are direction-sensitive:
   - Positive contributions occur when moving in the positive coordinate direction.
   - Negative contributions arise with movement in the negative direction.

This method assesses how changes in each coordinate contribute to the integral, influenced by the curve's traversal direction.
