There you go, I decided to turn the car around so now I'm facing the sun.
The late afternoon sun peaking through right in between two sections of the mountain.
Lots of dogs coming for the run. Anyway that was a good run.
Quite a cool breeze late in the afternoon and so quite a good pace.
One video I uploaded for today at least I've had a chance to make some.
I run so late in the afternoon and then you know it's either running or making a video and
I come for a run so it's very difficult these days. Anyway there's one video we're looking at
some of the interesting things you can do with group actions in abstract algebra and that is
starting at least to look at the orbit stabilizer theorem and in today's video particularly I look
at what the orbit of a set is in abstract algebra. I've also made a Mathematica notebook
and I'll put some links in where you can download the notebook. Remember you can
always use Mathematica free online and I'll put some links to that as well so if you're interested
in the notes that go that I'm starting to make at least to go with the abstract algebra have a
have a look at that. Otherwise hopefully I can I can do both video recording and a run tomorrow
and I'll see you then.
