In this video I will discuss a list of causes of hypothyroidism and the concept of subclinical
hypothyroidism.
Many of the causes of hypothyroidism are discussed in other videos and I urge you to watch these.
A list of causes include iodine insufficiency, over administration of thyroxine, thyroiditis
especially Hashimoto thyroiditis, radioactive iodine ablation or surgical resection, medications
such as iodide, potassium perchlorate, lithium and amiodarone, agenesis or dysgenesis of the
thyroid and secondary hypothyroidism due to hypothalamic and pituitary disorders and these
include pituitary tumors, metastases, hemorrhage, necrosis, aneurysms, surgery, trauma, infiltrative
disorders, infectious diseases, chronic lymphocytic hypophysitis, brain tumors, congenital abnormalities
and any disorders of these systems resulting in decreased hormone production.
One form of hypothyroidism that must be mentioned is subclinical hypothyroidism.
The causes are the same as for proper hypothyroidism with the rate of conversion to overt hypothyroidism
in the region of 4-18% per year.
The majority of cases simply represent the early stages of most of the diseases mentioned above.
A large subset of patients will recover normal function though and in these cases a transient
form of thyroiditis is the most probable cause.
On laboratory diagnosis, subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by normal thyroid hormone levels
and slightly elevated TSH levels.
The symptom complex varies from a clinical euthyroid state to some measure of any of the symptoms
mentioned with overt hypothyroidism.
In the next video I will discuss the diagnosis and general management of hypothyroidism.
