The provided text explains how to calculate the cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional space. Here is a concise summary:

1. **Definition**: The cross product \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\) results in a vector perpendicular to both input vectors, useful for finding normals to surfaces.

2. **Calculation Method**:
   - Express vectors as \((u_1, u_2, u_3)\) and \((v_1, v_2, v_3)\).
   - Form a 3x3 matrix with unit vectors \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) in the first row:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     i & j & k \\
     u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
     v_1 & v_2 & v_3
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Use cofactor expansion along the first row to calculate:
     - \(i\)-component: \(u_2v_3 - u_3v_2\)
     - \(j\)-component: \(-(u_1v_3 - u_3v_1)\) (note the negative sign)
     - \(k\)-component: \(u_1v_2 - u_2v_1\)

3. **Result**: The resulting vector is perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\), confirmed by a zero dot product with each original vector.

4. **Application**:
   - This method applies to two-dimensional vectors extended into three dimensions.
   - For 2D vectors, the cross product results in a perpendicular vector along the z-axis (k direction).

5. **Methodology**: The text emphasizes using matrix determinants and cofactors rather than memorizing formulas.

6. **Limitations**: This approach is not applicable to four or higher-dimensional spaces but covers common problems in physics and engineering.

The text concludes by highlighting an example of calculating a cross product using the matrix method, confirming perpendicularity through dot products.
