This presentation provides an overview of managing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a common and serious condition seen in emergency departments. The speaker begins by wishing luck to colleagues DJ, Lian, and Anthony.

Upper GI bleeds often present with symptoms like hematemesis (vomiting blood), while melena (black, tarry stools) is less common, and hematogesia (blood in stool without blackening) is rare. Common causes include gastric ulcers, esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss tears, angiodysplasia, Dieulafoy lesions, and sometimes no identifiable lesion. Dieulafoy lesions involve submucosal vessel dilations that erode into the epithelium.

Less common causes of upper GI bleeding can be hemobilia (blood in the biliary system), hemocystic pancreaticus (blood in the pancreatic duct), aorto-enteric fistula, and Cameron lesions. The latter occurs rarely in hiatal hernias.

The approach to managing an upper GI bleed involves initial patient evaluation for stability, diagnostic studies like endoscopy, identifying the source of bleeding, and potential management via endoscopic intervention.

Key aspects include:

- **History**: Prior bleeds often indicate a repeat from the same lesion. History can suggest possible sources (e.g., portal hypertension suggesting varices, aortic repairs hinting at fistulas) and relevant comorbidities affecting treatment.
  
- **Symptoms Assessment**: Signs of hypovolemia such as tachycardia or orthostatic changes indicate severity.

- **Physical Examination**: Look for signs like abdominal guarding that may suggest perforation. Examine stool color, though it's not always reliable.

- **Lab Tests**: Include complete blood count, liver tests, coagulation studies, and specific markers such as BUN to creatinine ratio indicating upper GI bleeding.

- **Nasogastric Lavage**: While helpful for reducing endoscopy time, its impact on mortality or hospital stay is inconclusive.

For risk stratification, the presentation introduces three scoring systems:

1. **Roc 2 Score**: Considers age, hemodynamic shock, comorbidities, and endoscopic findings.
   
2. **Blatchford Score**: Based on clinical data without endoscopy (e.g., BUN levels), useful in emergency settings.

3. **AIMS-65 Score**: Easy to implement with high accuracy; factors include albumin levels, among others, as part of a mnemonic tool for assessment.

These tools help clinicians assess the risk and guide management strategies for patients with upper GI bleeding.

Based on your description, here's a structured summary and guidance related to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding management:

### Patient Management

1. **Hospitalization**: 
   - Severe cases with ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability require hospitalization.
   - Monitor vital signs and blood work.

2. **Resuscitation**:
   - Initial focus should be on stabilizing the patient through fluid resuscitation and possibly blood transfusions if necessary.

3. **Medications**:
   - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used to reduce stomach acid, which can help in healing ulcers.
   - Antibiotics may be considered for cirrhotic patients due to a high risk of infection.

### Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures

1. **Upper Endoscopy**:
   - The first-line diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity.
   - Recommended early (within 24 hours) to identify the bleeding source.
   - Use Forrest Classification to assess ulcer severity and predict re-bleeding risks.

2. **Endoscopic Treatment Options**:
   - **Thermal Coagulation**: Effective for actively bleeding ulcers, works by coaptive coagulation.
   - **Hemoclip Application**: Similar to surgical ligation; useful as a marker for further interventions if needed.
   - **Injection Therapy**: Should be used in conjunction with other methods like thermal or hemoclip due to higher re-bleed rates if used alone.

3. **Second Endoscopy (Relook)**:
   - Consider within 24 hours of initial endoscopy, especially in high-risk patients identified via Forrest Classification.
   - Aim to prevent recurrent bleeding and ensure initial therapy success.

### Follow-up Care

1. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Evaluate the risk of re-bleeding based on Forrest classification and clinical presentation.
   - High-risk cases may require more aggressive follow-up or interventions like angiography or surgery if endoscopic methods fail.

2. **Long-term Management**:
   - Address underlying causes, such as H. pylori infection or NSAID use.
   - Lifestyle modifications, including diet changes and cessation of smoking/alcohol consumption, can be beneficial.

### Additional Considerations

- **Antifibrinolytic Agents**: Limited role in upper GI bleed management due to lack of impact on mortality or need for surgery/transfusion.
- **Patient Education**: Inform about signs of re-bleeding and when to seek immediate medical attention.

This overview should help guide the initial approach, but always tailor interventions based on individual patient needs and clinical judgment.

The text discusses considerations and options regarding second relook endoscopy, which is not typically recommended unless necessary. It advises performing a second relook if visualization during the initial procedure was compromised due to blood or debris, or if there were concerns about suboptimal therapy in previous endoscopic treatments.

For managing recurrent or persistent gastrointestinal bleeding:
- **Persistent Bleeding:** This occurs when bleeding continues despite endoscopy or starts during treatment of a non-bleeding lesion. 
- **Recurrent Bleeding:** This happens after initial spontaneous hemostasis, following successful earlier endoscopy.

Treatment options include:
1. **Surgery**: Surgical interventions are considered, especially if endoscopic therapy fails or the patient is stable but suffers from recurrent hemorrhage and perforation. Types of surgeries mentioned are oversewing arteries with truncal vagotomy, trunctomy with gastrojejunostomy (Piloris 2), and highly selective vagotomy, which can be done laparoscopically in stable patients.

2. **Interventional Angiography**: This is a less invasive option that's effective but best suited for high-risk patients.

3. **Treatment of Bleeding into Biliary or Pancreatic Ducts**: This technique may not work well in patients with impaired coagulation.

Post-treatment, itâ€™s essential to follow up with discharged patients to address the underlying causes of their ulcers, such as Helicobacter pylori infection or NSAID use.
