This presentation provides an overview of managing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a common and serious condition seen in emergency departments. The speaker begins by wishing luck to colleagues DJ, Lian, and Anthony.

Upper GI bleeds often present with symptoms like hematemesis (vomiting blood), while melena (black, tarry stools) is less common, and hematogesia (blood in stool without blackening) is rare. Common causes include gastric ulcers, esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss tears, angiodysplasia, Dieulafoy lesions, and sometimes no identifiable lesion. Dieulafoy lesions involve submucosal vessel dilations that erode into the epithelium.

Less common causes of upper GI bleeding can be hemobilia (blood in the biliary system), hemocystic pancreaticus (blood in the pancreatic duct), aorto-enteric fistula, and Cameron lesions. The latter occurs rarely in hiatal hernias.

The approach to managing an upper GI bleed involves initial patient evaluation for stability, diagnostic studies like endoscopy, identifying the source of bleeding, and potential management via endoscopic intervention.

Key aspects include:

- **History**: Prior bleeds often indicate a repeat from the same lesion. History can suggest possible sources (e.g., portal hypertension suggesting varices, aortic repairs hinting at fistulas) and relevant comorbidities affecting treatment.
  
- **Symptoms Assessment**: Signs of hypovolemia such as tachycardia or orthostatic changes indicate severity.

- **Physical Examination**: Look for signs like abdominal guarding that may suggest perforation. Examine stool color, though it's not always reliable.

- **Lab Tests**: Include complete blood count, liver tests, coagulation studies, and specific markers such as BUN to creatinine ratio indicating upper GI bleeding.

- **Nasogastric Lavage**: While helpful for reducing endoscopy time, its impact on mortality or hospital stay is inconclusive.

For risk stratification, the presentation introduces three scoring systems:

1. **Roc 2 Score**: Considers age, hemodynamic shock, comorbidities, and endoscopic findings.
   
2. **Blatchford Score**: Based on clinical data without endoscopy (e.g., BUN levels), useful in emergency settings.

3. **AIMS-65 Score**: Easy to implement with high accuracy; factors include albumin levels, among others, as part of a mnemonic tool for assessment.

These tools help clinicians assess the risk and guide management strategies for patients with upper GI bleeding.

Based on your description, here's a structured summary and guidance related to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding management:

### Patient Management

1. **Hospitalization**: 
   - Severe cases with ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability require hospitalization.
   - Monitor vital signs and blood work.

2. **Resuscitation**:
   - Initial focus should be on stabilizing the patient through fluid resuscitation and possibly blood transfusions if necessary.

3. **Medications**:
   - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used to reduce stomach acid, which can help in healing ulcers.
   - Antibiotics may be considered for cirrhotic patients due to a high risk of infection.

### Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures

1. **Upper Endoscopy**:
   - The first-line diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity.
   - Recommended early (within 24 hours) to identify the bleeding source.
   - Use Forrest Classification to assess ulcer severity and predict re-bleeding risks.

2. **Endoscopic Treatment Options**:
   - **Thermal Coagulation**: Effective for actively bleeding ulcers, works by coaptive coagulation.
   - **Hemoclip Application**: Similar to surgical ligation; useful as a marker for further interventions if needed.
   - **Injection Therapy**: Should be used in conjunction with other methods like thermal or hemoclip due to higher re-bleed rates if used alone.

3. **Second Endoscopy (Relook)**:
   - Consider within 24 hours of initial endoscopy, especially in high-risk patients identified via Forrest Classification.
   - Aim to prevent recurrent bleeding and ensure initial therapy success.

### Follow-up Care

1. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Evaluate the risk of re-bleeding based on Forrest classification and clinical presentation.
   - High-risk cases may require more aggressive follow-up or interventions like angiography or surgery if endoscopic methods fail.

2. **Long-term Management**:
   - Address underlying causes, such as H. pylori infection or NSAID use.
   - Lifestyle modifications, including diet changes and cessation of smoking/alcohol consumption, can be beneficial.

### Additional Considerations

- **Antifibrinolytic Agents**: Limited role in upper GI bleed management due to lack of impact on mortality or need for surgery/transfusion.
- **Patient Education**: Inform about signs of re-bleeding and when to seek immediate medical attention.

This overview should help guide the initial approach, but always tailor interventions based on individual patient needs and clinical judgment.

The text discusses considerations and options regarding second relook endoscopy, which is not typically recommended unless necessary. It advises performing a second relook if visualization during the initial procedure was compromised due to blood or debris, or if there were concerns about suboptimal therapy in previous endoscopic treatments.

For managing recurrent or persistent gastrointestinal bleeding:
- **Persistent Bleeding:** This occurs when bleeding continues despite endoscopy or starts during treatment of a non-bleeding lesion. 
- **Recurrent Bleeding:** This happens after initial spontaneous hemostasis, following successful earlier endoscopy.

Treatment options include:
1. **Surgery**: Surgical interventions are considered, especially if endoscopic therapy fails or the patient is stable but suffers from recurrent hemorrhage and perforation. Types of surgeries mentioned are oversewing arteries with truncal vagotomy, trunctomy with gastrojejunostomy (Piloris 2), and highly selective vagotomy, which can be done laparoscopically in stable patients.

2. **Interventional Angiography**: This is a less invasive option that's effective but best suited for high-risk patients.

3. **Treatment of Bleeding into Biliary or Pancreatic Ducts**: This technique may not work well in patients with impaired coagulation.

Post-treatment, itâ€™s essential to follow up with discharged patients to address the underlying causes of their ulcers, such as Helicobacter pylori infection or NSAID use.

This presentation discusses an approach to managing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a common yet serious condition often seen in emergency departments. The speaker begins by acknowledging colleagues who have recently passed exams and offers well wishes.

Upper GI bleeds typically present with hematemesis (vomiting blood), though melena (black, tarry stools) can occur but is rarer than hematogesia (blood in the stool). Common causes include gastric and duodenal ulcers, esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss tears, angiodysplasia, Dieulafoy lesions, and sometimes no identifiable lesion.

Dieulafoy lesions involve submucosal blood vessel dilations that erode into the epithelium. Other less common causes are hemobilia (blood in the biliary system), usually due to liver or biliary pathologies; hemocircus pancreaticus (blood in the pancreatic duct); and aorto-enteric fistula, typically occurring at specific duodenal sections.

The general approach to managing upper GI bleeding involves initial patient evaluation focusing on stability and diagnostic studies. Severity assessment identifies potential sources of bleeding and determines if endoscopic management is feasible. A thorough patient history can provide insights into the bleeding source, such as previous bleeds or conditions like portal hypertension suggesting esophageal varices.

Medications are crucial in this context, with NSAIDs, warfarin, or antiplatelet therapies being common contributors to ulcers and bleeds. Comorbid conditions such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CCF), renal failure, or hepatic dysfunction significantly influence management strategies.

Symptoms like hypotension, dizziness, or altered mental status indicate the severity of bleeding. Lab tests include blood counts, serum chemistries, liver and coagulation studies, with a high BUN-to-creatinine ratio suggesting an upper GI bleed.

Nasogastric lavage's diagnostic value is debated; while it may shorten endoscopy time, it doesn't impact mortality, hospital stay length, or transfusion needs. Risk stratification can utilize scoring systems like the Rockall, Blatchford, and AIMS-65. The Rockall score considers age, shock, comorbidities, and endoscopic findings but is complex. The Blatchford score excludes endoscopy results, considering BUN/creatinine ratios and other clinical markers. AIMS-65 uses a mnemonic for albumin levels, among other factors, and is noted for its accuracy and ease of implementation.

Overall, the presentation emphasizes thorough evaluation and risk assessment in managing upper GI bleeding, integrating both clinical judgment and scoring systems to guide treatment decisions effectively.

The text you provided covers various aspects of managing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, particularly focusing on ulcer-related bleeds and the use of endoscopy for diagnosis and treatment. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Initial Assessment and Management**:
   - The management of upper GI bleeding depends on factors like hemodynamic stability, comorbidities, and patient preferences.
   - Early intervention with endoscopy is recommended within 24 hours to diagnose and manage the bleed effectively.

2. **Endoscopic Classification (Forest Classification)**:
   - Ulcers can be classified based on their appearance during endoscopy using the Forrest classification system:
     - Forrest Ia: Actively bleeding ulcers.
     - Forrest Ib: Oozing without visible vessel.
     - Forrest IIa: Non-bleeding visible vessels.
     - Forrest IIb: Adherent clot.
     - Forrest III: Clean base ulcer.
   - The risk of re-bleeding varies with this classification, being highest in actively bleeding ulcers (Forrest Ia).

3. **Endoscopic Treatment Options**:
   - **Thermal Coagulation**: Uses heat to achieve hemostasis by sealing blood vessels.
     - Contact probe technique compresses the probe against the vessel for effective coagulation.
   - **Hemoclipping**: Application of clips to control bleeding, similar to surgical ligation. It can serve as a marker if re-bleeding occurs.
   - **Injection Therapy**: Involves injecting agents like epinephrine but should not be used alone due to higher re-bleed rates. Often combined with thermal or mechanical methods.

4. **Second Re-look Endoscopy**:
   - A follow-up endoscopy is typically performed within 24 hours after initial treatment, especially in patients at high risk of re-bleeding (e.g., those with Forrest Ia ulcers).

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for cirrhotic patients due to a high risk of infection.
   - Antifibrinolytic agents like tranexamic acid have been shown to reduce mortality but not re-bleeding or the need for surgery.

6. **Choice of Endoscopic Therapy**:
   - The choice between different endoscopic therapies (thermal coagulation, hemoclipping) depends on factors such as ulcer location and the expertise of the endoscopist.
   - Meta-analyses suggest that combined approaches are more effective than monotherapy with epinephrine for preventing re-bleeding.

These points provide a comprehensive overview of managing upper GI bleeding through endoscopic interventions, highlighting the importance of timely diagnosis, appropriate classification, and tailored treatment strategies.

The text discusses considerations and options for managing recurrent or persistent gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly after an initial endoscopy.

1. **Second Re-look Endoscopy**: Generally not recommended unless necessary. Indications include limited visualization during the first procedure due to blood or debris, or concerns about suboptimal previous endoscopic therapy.

2. **Management of Bleeding**:
   - **Persistent Bleeding**: Defined as active bleeding that continues despite endoscopy or occurs during treatment of a non-bleeding lesion.
   - **Recurrent Bleeding**: Occurs after initial hemostasis from successful endoscopy has been achieved, but the bleeding resumes.

3. **Treatment Options**:
   - **Surgery**: Discussed as an option for cases where endoscopic therapy fails or is inappropriate. Types of surgeries mentioned include oversewing arteries with truncal vagotomy and trunctomy with gastrojejunostomy (Pilorat 2), highly selective vagotomy, which can be performed laparoscopically.
   - **Indications for Surgery**: Include failure of endoscopic therapy, hemodynamic instability in stable patients despite resuscitation, recurrent hemorrhage, or perforation.

4. **Interventional Angiography**: Described as a less invasive but equally effective option compared to surgery, recommended for high-risk patients. Its success may be limited in those with impaired coagulation.

5. **Follow-up Care**: After discharging the patient, it is crucial to manage and address the underlying cause of the ulcer, such as H. pylori infection or NSAID use, to prevent recurrence. 

This summary highlights key points about managing gastrointestinal bleeding post-endoscopy, including indications for further interventions, surgical options, and follow-up care.
