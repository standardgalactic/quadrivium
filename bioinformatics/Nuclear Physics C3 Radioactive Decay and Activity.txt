To some of our famous quick-fire questions, let's just see if we understand.
We have Thallium 208 and it has a half-life of 3.053 minutes.
At a given instant, the activity, remember the activity is the change divided by time,
is 2,400, so it's 2,400 integrations per disintegrations per second, 2,000 point back it off.
Nine minutes later, the activity is, without doing calculations,
is it less than 8, just less than 8, just more than 8, just less than a third,
but just more than a third times 2,400 integrations.
Now remember, what did we do?
We divided the half-life into the time we have,
so if I have 9 divided by 3.053,
then it's just going to be just under 3, 2.9, 2.9 something.
Now I take 2 to the power, that is 2 to the power 3,
it's almost 3, 2 to the power 3 is 8,
but it's not really 3, it's 2.9 something.
So 2.9 something.
Don't know what happened there.
It's 2.9 something, not really.
Not really, 3 then.
So it's not fully 8, it's actually just under 8.
So it will have to be this one, because I'm dividing by 8 would give me this,
but I'm dividing by something slightly smaller than 8, 7.9 something.
In other words, my denominator is slightly smaller,
in other words, the answer will be slightly bigger.
So it must be this one, slightly bigger than an eighth.
Another quick question, we have indium-115,
and it has a half-life of 4.4 times 10 to the power of 14 years.
If you think the universe, we think, is about 14 or 13.7 whatever billion years,
that's 10 to the power of 12 years old,
that's longer than the age of the known universe.
Is it possible, though, for a single nucleus to decay in the next second,
in one second?
Yes, it is.
Because remember, it happens completely at random.
At any one time, one nucleus can.
It does not mean that we have to wait this long,
and then suddenly, on that day of the half-life, boom,
and that very day, half of them disappear.
No, some of them slowly disappear in that time.
So by the time we get there, half is left.
So one can decay, one nucleus can decay at any time.
It's completely random.
The last one, I haven't even written it down,
but if I have two samples of the same radioactive material,
is it possible for, I'm looking at them now,
that the activities, changes per second, is different?
Yes, it's completely possible for them to be different.
Because once again, at any instant in time,
it is completely random which, and if any,
one particular one decays.
So this is completely possible for them
to have different activity,
that's becurel, or curie,
that is, for becurel,
at least the number of disintegrations per second,
for them to be different
for those two same exact samples.
This is an absolutely general problem.
I know that the mass of a neutron
is 1.675 times 10 to the power,
negative 27 kilogram.
If a neutron is free on its own,
it is not forming part of a nucleus,
as a, as a nucleon,
it has a half-life of 10.4 minutes
and undergoes beta-negative decay.
So you're going to get a proton,
plus an electron,
plus an anti-neutrina.
So the half-life there is 10.4 minutes.
If I multiply that by 60,
if I multiply that by 60,
that's 624 seconds indeed.
So, if I have a beam
of five electron-volved neutrons,
I hope I didn't see neutrinas before,
and a mass of a neutron,
half half of a neutron, neutron,
and outside of that,
nucleus.
If I have a beam
of five electron-volved neutrons,
how far would they have traveled
from an instant in time
until 25% of them have decayed?
So what am I asking myself here?
I have N0 to start off with,
and then 25% are gone,
so I have 0.75 of N0 left.
So 25% has decayed,
so I'm left with 75%.
And remember,
I think these problems
are not about how many have decayed,
but how many are left.
So it's 0.75 N0.
Now, I think what we need to do
is just to work out
how long it will take
for 0.750 to have decayed.
In other words,
if I have N equals N0
N0 times E to the power
negative lambda times T.
Now, it's not the T half-life,
I only use T equals,
N equals a half N0
and use the T to the power of half-life
to get lambda.
So, as I'm not using that equation,
this is T how long it will take.
Now,
I know,
I don't know N,
and I don't know N0,
but I'm sitting there
that N0,
N equals,
in other words,
N is going to equal
0.75 N0.
So I can put 0.75,
0.75 N0
equals N0
to the power,
E to the power,
E to the power,
negative lambda T.
So I can get rid of this.
So I have two unknowns still,
lambda and T,
but I do know the equation for lambda
in as much as it was 0.693
or the natural log of 2
divided by the half-life.
So if I divide 0.693
by 10.4 minutes,
I get 0.0,
I think it was,
666 inverse minutes.
And if I divide it by 624 seconds,
I get 1.11 times 10 to the power,
negative 3 inverse seconds.
So now it remains for me
to solve for T.
I can take the natural log
of both sides.
So it's the natural log
of 3 quarters
or 0.75
equals the natural log,
natural log of E to the power,
negative lambda T.
Okay.
Remember with exponent,
with natural log,
I can bring this in front.
So I'm left with negative lambda T
equals the natural log of E
and the natural log of E
is just 1.
So I'm left with
negative log of 0.75
equals negative lambda T.
And I can solve for T
and as much as T
is going to equal
the natural log of 0.75
divided by minus lambda.
Now, I would like T in seconds.
Why would I like T in seconds?
Because I can convert electron volts,
I can convert electron volts into,
so that energy equals 5.00 electron volts
times 1.60 times 10 to the power,
negative 19 joule
per 1 electron volt.
That's my conversion rate.
Okay, that does not mean
that there's any charge involved here.
Certainly, a neutron has no charge,
0 coulomb,
but I can still express electron volts
as joules.
And joules involves SI units,
which include seconds.
So I want seconds in my problem.
So I'm going to solve here
for negative 1.11
times 10 to the power,
negative 3 in those seconds.
And that gives me a time,
I think, of about 259 seconds.
So for me to have 75% left,
the original is going to be
the half-life of 624 seconds,
it's going to take 259 seconds.
259 seconds for me to have lost
25% of my neutrons.
Okay, now energy,
it's quite simply,
equals non-relativistically,
or half mv squared,
leaving me with v,
equals the square root
of 2 times kinetic energy
divided by the mass.
I do know kinetic energy,
I do know mass.
So I was given the mass
of the neutron there,
I've just worked out
how many joules of energy I had,
and it's a travelling beam,
so I'm taking all of that
as kinetic energy.
I also know from classical physics,
velocity equals distance over time,
in other words,
distance equals velocity times time.
I do have velocity now,
I do have time now,
and I get an answer of about
8.01 times 10 to the power 6 meters,
8.01 omega meters.
Okay, 8.01 times 10 to the power 6 meters,
really much problem.
