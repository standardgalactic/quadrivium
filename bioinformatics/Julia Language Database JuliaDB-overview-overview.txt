The provided text outlines how to create and manipulate tables using Julia DB, focusing on table creation, data extraction, indexing, and joining operations.

### Creating Tables

1. **Table One**:
   - **Data Preparation**: Generate IDs from 1 to 10 and ages as random integers following a normal distribution centered around 30.
   - **Creation**:
     ```julia
     table1 = Table([
         collect(1:10), 
         randn(Int, 10) .* 5 + 30
       ], names=[:ID, :Age])
     ```
   - This results in a `table1` with columns `ID` and `Age`.

2. **Table Two**:
   - **Data Preparation**: Use IDs from 1 to 10, Roman numeral groups, and random values for HB and WCC.
   - **Creation**:
     ```julia
     table2 = Table([
         collect(1:10), 
         ["I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX", "X"], 
         randn(Float64, 10) .* 4 + 16, 
         randn(Float64, 10) .* 3 + 12
       ], names=[:ID, :Group, :HB, :WCC], primary_key=:ID)
     ```
   - `table2` includes columns `ID`, `Group`, `HB`, and `WCC`, with `ID` as the primary key.

### Indexing and Extracting Data

- **Extract Specific Row**:
  ```julia
  subject3 = table1[3, :]
  ```
  This retrieves the third row from `table1`.

- **Access Column Value for a Subject**:
  ```julia
  age_of_subject3 = subject3.Age
  ```
  Accesses the `Age` of the extracted subject.

- **Extract Specific Rows by Index List**:
  ```julia
  selected_rows = table1[[3, 5, 8], :]
  ```
  Extracts rows 3, 5, and 8 from `table1`.

### Joining Tables

- Using primary keys, tables can be joined:
  ```julia
  joined_table = innerjoin(table1, table2)
  ```
  This performs an inner join on the common column `ID`.

### Summary

The text describes creating and manipulating tables in JuliaDB by specifying data types, setting primary keys for joins, and performing data extraction operations. It highlights flexibility in defining table columns and using indexing to manage data efficiently.

The text also mentions a method involving importing existing lists and defining columns as primary keys without symbol notation, emphasizing the ease of defining multiple primary key columns using symbols. The example shows creating an "ID" column from a predefined list and a "CRP" column with random values based on a normal distribution. This approach showcases JuliaDB's adaptability in table creation for various data management tasks.
