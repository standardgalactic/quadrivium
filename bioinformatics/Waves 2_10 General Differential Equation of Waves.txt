In this video, I'm going to look at the general differential equation for all waves.
And here it is.
Di squared y over di x squared equals y over d squared.
And d squared y over dt squared.
There it is.
You can memorize this and that can be the end of your video.
But what I want to do is just to give you an overview of how to derive this equation.
It's a bit of a long derivation and we do make a few leaps when we do explain this and I'll get to that.
And the way it's done in most books is we look at a small part of a wave.
So it's just here on the upslope, it goes up the sine wave, it comes down, it goes up.
So we're only looking at this small piece.
And we're only looking at one element in that as it's moving up and down as the wave passes through it.
So it is going to experience an acceleration in the positive y direction.
And that's what I've denoted there.
Okay, we're going to take a very small element in that wave, in that rope of a length l.
Of a length l.
And because it is so small, if we just look at the x-axis, it's almost equal to, we can take it as one of the jumps we made,
take it to be equal to dx.
Small differential length on the x-axis.
So it's so tiny and we write here as the upslope starts.
So these two we're going to take as equal length.
If we take the two ends, there are two forces on the ends of our differential length of rope there.
And here we've denoted it, force one in that direction, force two in this direction,
and as you can see, it is this tangential to the rope element there,
which actually means it denotes the slope, actually, if you think about it,
of an equation that we can write for this curve.
Okay?
So there's a force in that direction, a force in that direction,
and if we look at the absolute values, it's going to equal the tension that there is,
the tension that there is in that rope.
Right, now that we've established what's going on here,
maybe the last thing just to mention is that this differential length of rope,
remember that rope also describes an equation for the curve, remember?
And we had y equals y max times the sine of k is minus omega t.
Okay, it has a mass, differential mass, small piece of rope with a mass.
Now there's some equations, old friends of ours,
this even goes way back to school.
Okay?
First, from Newton, we know force equals mass times acceleration.
And there are two forces pulling on this.
Let's negate it so small, we can negate the force of gravity.
Another jump.
So the net force is going to be f2 minus f1.
They are at very slightly different angles.
They're going to have a very slightly different slope.
Slope there and the slope there of this curve is slightly different.
And if I express this in terms of that, that's going to be my differential mass.
And then it's going to be a in the y direction.
Because that's all that happens to that specific piece of string.
It doesn't move back and forth.
It only moves up and down.
Now, from one of the very first lectures, we note that the linear density,
linear mass density, is this mass divided by length.
This is a long derivation, so from time to time,
we're going to look on my cheat board on that side,
so we don't skip a step.
And that I remember what I wanted to say.
So we have the differential mass is going to be mu times L.
But we know L is almost dx, so that's going to be mu dx.
That's important.
That's an important step for us.
This from classical mechanics, we know that acceleration is the first derivative of velocity.
It's the second derivative of displacement.
So in our instance here, we're going to have that a in the y,
acceleration in the y direction,
is going to be d, whether they are, d squared, y, over dt squared.
So our displacement of this rope is only up and down.
Remember, it's now a minuscule, small piece of rope on the x-axis
that's only going to move up and down.
What I want to do, so that I don't get confused,
this one I'm going to call my equation 1, I think,
and this one I called my equation 2, okay?
Now, if we just look at slope,
remember, and that is what this force,
this tension force represents here,
that is F2.
We know that the slope of a line is this delta y
over delta x.
So some books denote slope textbooks with an s.
I like to use a, because we use a in differential calculus.
If you think of Euler's method,
if you don't know what I'm talking about,
it doesn't matter really.
But let's write that the slope then,
we can chart that the slope 2 there
is just going to be F2 of y divided by F2 of x.
Delta y over delta x.
What we also know, though,
is that just the length of F2
equals the square root of
F2 x squared plus F2 y squared.
Remember, and this is also going to equal
just the tension,
the tension in the rope.
If we take a piece that is very close
as the upswing just,
if it just starts,
we can make it so that this F2,
F2 y is much smaller than F1 y.
So we can actually just drop,
another job we're making,
we can actually drop F2 there.
So what are we going to get?
We're going to get that
the absolute value of our tension there.
Okay, if we drop F2 y,
because it's so infinitesimally small,
we are just left with a square root of
F2 x squared,
and that's just F2 x.
F2 x.
And F2 x,
if I use this
and put it back in there,
I'm going to be left with
the slope of the second force 2 of mine
is going to be F2 y
over tau,
over my tension.
Or,
I can rewrite F2 y
as tau
my tension times A2.
And if you look at it,
if you just do the same thing
for force number one,
you're also going to be left with,
that is going to be F1 y
over tau,
so that is going to leave us with,
that is going to leave us with,
F1 y equals tau
times A1.
I hope the video comes up here,
I think it does,
up there in the bottom.
so I just took for granted
that I'm taking it
very startled up slope
so that I can get rid of
F2 y here,
so I'm just left with tau
equaling F2 x.
And I've replaced that
in there.
I've replaced F2 x in there
with tau,
and I've just got F2 y
and F1 y
on its own.
And I'm going to call these
equations 3 and 4,
I think I did,
yes,
equation 3
and equation 4.
Equation 3 and equation 4.
Now let's start way back here.
F2 minus F1
equals D-M-A-Y.
And I'm going to use all of these,
and I'm going to replace things here.
So we're going to have for F2,
now remember because
I said that F2 y is so small
that F2 is in,
actually might as well be F2 x.
Might as well be,
let's see,
let's see what I did there.
Oh, sorry,
I'm a mistake.
That's not what I meant.
The F2 x's are going to be,
the F2 x value,
F2 x and F1 x
are in opposite directions.
For practical purposes,
they're the same,
so they're going to cancel out.
So my acceleration is only going to be
because of this F2 y here
and this F1 y here.
And that's going to be
in the positive direction,
this is in the negative.
So this can be related to the name
as F2 y minus F1 y.
Okay?
And that is what we've got there.
F2 y and F1 y.
So here,
we're going to have that
tau,
a 2 minus tau a 1
equals dm,
I can write as mu dx.
and a y,
I can write as d squared y
over dt squared.
Now,
very simply,
I can take out
the tau values there,
so there'll be a 2 minus a 1.
And that is going to be,
the dx I'm going to bring
to this side.
And this is going to be mu,
but remember,
I can write mu,
well,
let's just write mu.
Let's just write mu there,
dx,
dx I brought to the other side,
remember?
So that'll be d squared y
over dt squared.
Over dt squared.
I want to take this tau
to the other side,
so I'm left with a 2 minus a 1
over dx.
And that's going to be equal to mu over,
mu over tau,
d squared y dt squared.
I hope I still have enough time
left on this video.
Remember,
there's one thing that v equals,
or v squared equals,
tau over mu.
So,
mu over tau
going to equal 1 over v squared.
So I have mu over tau there,
so that's going to be,
I'm just going to carry on here.
What I just wanted to write,
what is,
what is the slope of,
of,
that minus the slope of that,
well this is going to be
a difference in slope,
a difference in slope,
which is,
I can denote as ds.
So,
dA I write,
most books have said,
has a ds,
I write a for slope,
from differential calculus.
So,
I'm sure,
the,
obviously the,
the length of the,
of the recording ran out,
I'm not quite sure where it stopped,
I'm just going to,
start from here,
bear with me,
I'll just place the videos together,
hopefully,
you don't miss out on anything.
I have said that,
the difference in slopes,
I can just write as dA,
a2 minus a1,
is this a differential,
the difference,
between the two slopes,
dx,
and that is going to be,
mu over tau,
I'm going to write as,
1 over v squared,
and I still have the second derivative,
in the y direction,
with respect to time.
Now what is a,
a is the slope,
what is slope,
this is dy dx,
change in y,
change in x,
so here I actually have d,
and I have dy dx,
of dx,
equals 1 over v squared,
d squared,
d squared y,
so here I have a d t squared,
and this is the second derivative,
of dy dx,
and we change this,
to partial derivative,
to partial derivative,
format,
and,
we can actually do,
should actually do that,
shouldn't we,
because this is the partial derivative,
just with respect to x,
and this is the partial derivative,
just with respect to t,
keeping x as a constant,
and this is keeping time,
as a constant,
on this side,
so we have,
just for competeness sake,
we have now,
d squared,
y,
over dx squared,
and that equals,
1 over v squared,
times,
d squared y,
over dt,
squared,
equation,
and that equals,
the general differential equation,
for all waves,
strictly for all waves,
These.
It's just as,
all waves,
of all waves,
and that equals,
the way first I 따라對不對
by et I don't know,
or as it turns out to beương,
verse 4,
and that's it,
and that equals,
the way he is counting the aim of galaxies,
the way it goes into the toi,
I don't know,
the way for them,
