The text outlines the definitions and key properties of three types of matrices: diagonal, triangular, and symmetric.

1. **Diagonal Matrix (D):**
   - A matrix where all non-diagonal elements are zero.
   - It is invertible if all its diagonal elements are non-zero; otherwise, it's singular.
   - Raising a diagonal matrix to a power \( K \) involves raising each diagonal element to the power \( K \), provided they're not zero. The inverse is another diagonal matrix with reciprocals of the original diagonal elements.

2. **Triangular Matrix:**
   - Includes upper triangular (zeros below the main diagonal) and lower triangular matrices (zeros above the main diagonal).
   - Transposing an upper triangular yields a lower triangular matrix, and vice versa.
   - Multiplying two upper or two lower triangular matrices results in another of the same type.
   - A triangular matrix is invertible if all its diagonal elements are non-zero, with the inverse also being triangular.

3. **Symmetric Matrix:**
   - A square matrix equal to its transpose (\( A = A^T \)).
   - The sum or difference of two symmetric matrices remains symmetric.
   - Multiplying a symmetric matrix by a scalar results in another symmetric matrix.
   - Symmetric matrices have properties useful for various mathematical applications.

These definitions emphasize the unique structural features that simplify operations like inversion and exponentiation.
