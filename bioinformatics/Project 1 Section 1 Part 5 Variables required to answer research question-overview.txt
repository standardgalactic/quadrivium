To conduct research effectively, several key steps and considerations are necessary after formulating a research question and completing a literature search:

1. **Power Calculation**: This step involves determining the sample size needed to ensure that statistical analysis will have sufficient power to detect meaningful effects.

2. **Identifying Patients**: Select patients from a relevant register, such as a hospital or ward register, based on diagnoses that align with your research focus.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - **Type of Infection**: Classify infections as major or minor. This data is nominal categorical since it involves categories without a natural order.
   - **Gender**: Record patients' gender (male or female) as nominal categorical data.
   - **Age**: Document each patient's age, which is ratio type numerical continuous data because it has a true zero and allows for mathematical operations.
   - **Admission HbA1c and CRP Levels**: Both are recorded as ratio type numerical continuous data due to their true zero points.

4. **Importance of Data Types**: Understanding the type of data collected (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) is crucial because it dictates the appropriate statistical analyses that can be performed later using tools like Julia.

5. **Setting Hypotheses**: The final step involves formulating hypotheses based on the variables and data types identified during the research planning phase.

The text outlines the preliminary steps needed to conduct a research study, specifically focusing on identifying variables and determining their types for appropriate data collection and analysis:

1. **Research Context**: After formulating a research question and conducting a literature search, the next step is to determine the necessary variables for the study.

2. **Power Calculation**: Although not detailed here, power calculation is crucial as it helps estimate the required sample size to achieve statistical significance in the analysis.

3. **Patient Identification**: Patients will be identified from hospital or ward registers where diagnoses are recorded.

4. **Data Collection**:
   - **Type of Infection**: Classified as major or minor; this is nominal categorical data because these terms lack a natural order.
   - **Gender**: Collected as male or female; also nominal categorical data, often included in clinical research for background information.
   - **Age**: Recorded as numerical continuous data (ratio type) since it has a true zero and can be used in mathematical operations.
   - **Admission HbA1c and CRP Levels**: Both are ratio type numerical continuous data with true zeros, suitable for mathematical analysis.

5. **Data Types Importance**: Understanding the nature of each variable's data is crucial as it influences the statistical methods that can be applied during analysis using tools like Julia.

6. **Setting Hypotheses**: The next step in research involves formulating hypotheses based on these variables and collected data.
