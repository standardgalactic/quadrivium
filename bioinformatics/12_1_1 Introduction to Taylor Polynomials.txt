So in this series we're going to start with the Taylor polynomials.
First of all, before we do that, we've got to review what a polynomial is.
Let's start with a polynomial in x of degree n.
It's easy to construct. Remember that we would have various constants.
Let's start with a constant a0.
We're going to have another constant. Let's call it a1.
We're going to have another constant. Let's call it a2.
And we're going to carry on until we get to some constant a n.
First we'll have x to the power 0, x to the power 1.
So we need to write this. It'll just be a0, ax.
This will be a sub 2 x squared.
And eventually we're going to get to a sub n, x to the power n.
So that will be a polynomial in x, x being our variable.
a sub 0, a sub 1, those will be until a sub n.
That will be our constant.
Constants n is of degree n.
In other words, the largest power is going to be n.
And so if we write 3 plus 2 x plus 4 x squared,
that will be a polynomial in x to the second degree,
a second degree polynomial.
Now what about a polynomial in x minus p of degree n,
where that p could be any real value?
So we're going to construct it the same.
We'll have an a0.
We'll have an a sub 1.
We'll have an a sub 2 to denote all our constants.
And eventually we're going to get to a sub n.
But now we have x minus p.
x minus p is our polynomial in which the variable in which
with p being any, as I mentioned, p being any real number.
So this will be x minus p to the power 0.
Anything to the power 0 is just 1.
So we'll leave that.
Here we're going to have x minus p.
Here we're going to have x minus p squared.
And we're going to go all the way to x minus p to the power n.
So that will be a polynomial in x minus p of degree n.
And with p being any real number,
and we just have to denote that, remember that an must not equal 0.
And this last one is 0.
This term becomes 0.
And that will be to the degree n minus 1, the previous one.
So we just add that.
So why are we reviewing these polynomials?
Why are we looking at them?
The thing about polynomials is polynomials are easy to manipulate.
Very easy to work with polynomials.
And they are very easy to differentiate and to integrate.
And if they are so easy to manipulate and integrate,
we might use them as approximations for more complex.
I don't want to use the term complex because we're not talking the square root of negative 1.
So let's say more difficult to work with equations.
If we have more difficult, oh, that's right, I'm going to have difficult.
If you have an equation that's a lot more difficult,
then you can't manipulate it, you can't differentiate it, you can't integrate it.
At least close to a certain point P, if I have some enormously complex graph,
that will be the graph of this type of function.
Or I can make it three-dimensional, even worse, three-difficult at a certain point.
At a certain point.
Say, for instance, at that value P,
I can approximate this little part of this difficult graph with a polynomial.
For instance, this is a straight line.
If I just select the vicinity of P,
I can approximate this difficult function with an easier polynomial function.
And I can then manipulate and differentiate and integrate it a lot easier to get to an answer.
So we've just heard that if we have a very difficult function
and we want to differentiate or integrate or manipulate it
at a point very close to a point P, for instance,
we can substitute that with a Taylor polynomial,
with some form of polynomial,
and that polynomial will be more easy to manipulate,
to integrate and differentiate.
But what is this substitute polynomial?
What is it?
And it has a function.
Now, we're going to go into the rigorous explanation of it.
What it is, we need to memorize it.
Let's say a Taylor polynomial of degree n in x
is going to equal the sum of k equals 0 to some integer n
of the f,
and we have the superscript k there,
of p times x minus p to the power of k divided by k factorial.
Divided by k factorial.
And that is our, let's call it substitute Taylor polynomial for our original function.
So what is, what is, what is, what's going on here?
Of course, this is a sigma notation,
so we're just going to have a sum of various parts.
Now this f of p,
this f of p,
is the original f of x
at x equals p.
That's the original difficult function that we were given.
Now what is that superscript k there?
That denotes the differentiation.
So if we start at k equals 0,
that will be the f of 0,
f superscript there of p,
and that's just the f of p.
That's just the f of p.
If we go to k equals 1 now,
that will be f1 of p,
and that's nothing other than f prime of p.
If I have now f2
in brackets, say, of p,
and it's going to equal f prime prime of p.
That's as simple as that.
As simple as that.
x minus p to the power k,
so x minus p originally,
x minus p to the power 0,
that's just going to be 1,
and x minus p to the power 1,
is going to just equal x minus p,
and on we go.
What about k factorial?
Remember, we do define
0 factorial as equal to 1,
and 1 factorial equals 2,
and 2 factorial equals 2 times 1,
that equals 2.
Oh, what did I write there?
1 factorial equals 1,
1 factorial equals 1.
And so we go,
let's just remind ourselves,
3 factorial equals 3 times 2 times 1,
and that equals 6.
So that is really all you need
to be able to do,
use this Taylor polynomial.
Let's start in the next video
with an easy example.
Good, I've left our Taylor polynomial
summation equation there,
and let's start with an easy example.
f of x equals 1 over x,
and we wind this at the point
p equals 2, for instance.
Now this is quite easy to do.
1 over x is certainly not a difficult function,
and we really don't need to approximate it
at x equal p equals 2,
in that vicinity of x approaching a p of 2.
But it's good to start with something easy,
so we can just get familiar
with how to do these.
So on the side, let's do some work.
What do we need?
We have that the f of x
is going to equal 1 over x,
and that leaves us with an f of p
as the f of 2,
and that equals a half.
And that equals a half.
But now we need to get the first order,
second order, third order,
and order would be the term that we used.
You might be asked,
get the third order Taylor polynomial
of this function.
Third order, which means we'll put a 3 in there.
And what we are,
what you will learn after a while,
after doing many of these,
and you can use a graphing app
on your computer or tablet,
and the higher you go with this order,
the more closely
your eventual long Taylor polynomial
approximates the curve
in that vicinity
where you have your constant.
And you'll do that,
do, make this successively,
start with 1,
make that successively larger,
and you'll see how the curve starts
approximating your original function
better and better.
So first of all,
let's get the f prime of x.
Remember that it's going to be
x to the power of negative 1.
So f prime of x,
if prime of x
would be negative 1 over x squared,
that's negative 1,
x to the power of negative 2,
that equals negative 1 over x squared.
And if we look at f prime at 0.2,
that is going to equal negative 1 quarter.
If we look at f prime prime of x,
f prime prime of x,
that's going to be 2x to the power of negative 3,
or 2 over x to the power of 3.
So f prime prime at 2
is going to equal 2 over 8,
which is a quarter.
And if we look at f prime prime prime of x,
it's going to be there,
that's negative 6,
x to the power of negative 4,
that equals negative 6 over x to the power of 4.
If we look at f prime prime prime,
f2,
that is going to be negative 6 over 16.
Negative 6 over 16,
I can simplify that,
and that's going to equal negative 3 over 8.
Negative 3 over 8,
I need 0 factorial,
I need 1 factorial,
I need 2 factorial,
and I need 3 factorial.
We know that's 1,
we know that's 1,
we know that's 2,
we know that that is 6.
So let's construct this.
So we're going to have theta polynomial
to the third order in x,
third order theta polynomial in x,
of this function f of x,
at a value of p equals 2.
So first of all,
we need this,
just the f of 2,
where was our f of 2?
There's our f of 2,
so that was going to be called a half.
Now,
x minus 2 to the power of 0,
it's this 1,
and 0 factorial is just 1,
so that would be our first term.
That would be our first term.
So think about it,
if we have,
if we have a graph,
1 over x,
something like that,
our first,
our first approximation,
let's say x equals 1,
x equals 2,
is this going to be this straight line,
x equals a half.
So in that vicinity,
it's not a very good approximation.
If any movement away from,
any movement away from 2,
it's going to give you
much different values
in y or f of x,
if this is x.
And this is y or the f of x.
If we move away from 2,
very suddenly we're going to get
different values for y or f of x.
Okay, let's add to that
the second one.
The second one says,
f prime at 2,
f prime at 2,
that's negative of a quarter,
so we're going to have minus 1,
and we're going to have a quarter there.
We're looking for x minus p,
x minus p to the power of 1,
so that is just going to be
x minus 2,
x minus 2.
So what we're going to have here
is a negative of a quarter,
so this is also going to be
a straight line,
something like that.
So that sort of starts
approximating things
a little bit better.
Okay, let's go for the,
that was 0,
that was 1.
Let's go for 2.
So we need f prime prime of 2,
f prime prime of 2,
that is positive of a quarter.
And we're going to have
x minus 2,
to the power of 2,
and 0, 1, 2, 2 factorial is 2.
So that is what we're going to have.
And now you're going to have,
ooh, I can't draw that,
you're going to have this,
and you're going to have this
better approximation
that's going to be x squared
and x,
so that's going to be a parabola.
And then lastly,
we need to add the extra one
that is to the power,
to the power,
or the third,
sorry,
the third derivative there.
And that is going to be
minus 3 over 8.
We're still going to have
our x minus 2
to the power of 3,
and then it's going to be over 6.
So if we simplify things,
the third Taylor polynomial
in x of our function
is going to be a half
minus x minus 2 over 4,
and that looks like
it's going to be plus an eighth,
x minus 2 squared over 8.
And here we're going to have,
we can simplify this,
that will go in 1,
that will choose minus 1 over 16,
x minus 2 to the power of 3 over 16.
So there's our third-order Taylor polynomial
in x,
and it's going to be an even,
even better fit.
It's going to be an even better fit,
especially,
most obviously,
where p equals 2
to our original,
to our original,
where was it?
It was somewhere here.
To our original
f of x equals 1 over x.
So the further on I go,
the more complex
the Taylor polynomial becomes,
the better approximation
it's going to be
in that vicinity,
and even a bit further
it's going to fit even better.
Now you might say
it's much more difficult
to manipulate this,
to differentiate it,
to integrate it,
than this,
and that probably is true.
That probably is true,
but when things start
getting really complex
and we only want to work
with a function of values
in that vicinity,
these Taylor polynomials
can be a lot easier
to work with.
