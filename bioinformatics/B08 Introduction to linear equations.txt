Let's move on to linear equations. We will have a differential equation in this form.
We'll have some function of x as a coefficient to the first derivative of this variable y,
plus another function of x as a coefficient to just the variable y, and that equals a third function of x.
We'll call it g of x. And that is called a linear differential equation.
Now, before we get into what it means, what we can do with it, let's just simplify things a bit.
Let's just divide everything by this coefficient function here,
so that we just get the first derivative of this variable y on its own.
And that will leave me here.
And all we've done is just rewritten this in what is called the standard form.
And that is the way that you should try any equation that you find in this format.
Try and get it with a constant coefficient, not a function of x coefficient,
and get it in this form. It's called the standard form.
So we've just called this expression here a sub zero of x divided by a sub one of x,
which is called a p of x. Just gave it a new name.
Similarly, on this side, we've called it f of x.
Now, we're going to seek a solution on an interval i,
for which both the coefficient functions p, this p of x and f are continuous.
So once we've done this division, so that we get a constant coefficient here,
we're going to just look at these two functions, p of x and f of x,
and just see where they are continuous.
And on that interval, we will find a family of solutions for this linear differential equation.
Now, the beauty about a linear equation is that you're going to find a solution
that is the sum of two different solutions.
Remember, we want the variable equals something, and it's going to be y sub c plus y sub p.
Now, y sub c is the solution of the associated homogeneous equation.
Remember, the homogeneous equation, this f of x would be zero.
So first derivative with respect to x of this variable y plus some function of x times y equals zero.
That's the homogeneous differential equation.
So the solution to this, which might be a lot easier to do just by separating variables,
and we'll look at that.
But there'll be another part called the particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation.
So f of x doesn't equal zero, and if you add those two together,
you're going to get the family of solutions to this linear equation.
Now, something very special happens if we just look at solving this homogeneous part.
So we've put f of x equal to zero.
We've taken p of x over across to the other side,
and now we just separate variables.
That'll leave us on this side with the natural log of the absolute value of y.
And on this side, we can't solve for this now because we don't know what the p of x is.
And we'll just have a constant as well, e to the power of some constant,
because we're just going to exponentiate the natural log of the absolute value of y on this side.
That'll leave us this solution associated with a homogeneous equation, y sub c, equals some constant c.
And just look at the previous videos how to do separation of variables.
You'll see this is easy to do.
That'll leave us with this.
So there's a negative sign there because it was minus px.
If I just bring this into the denominator, it would be e to the power of the indefinite integral of p of x with respect to x.
And this is called the integrating factor.
There it is.
That's another important thing to remember, the integrating factor.
And we're going to use this integrating factor to make life a lot easier for ourselves when we are in standard form.
Once we have this integrating factor and multiply it out throughout the standard form equation,
something beautiful is going to happen.
And we'll look at some examples in the next video.
