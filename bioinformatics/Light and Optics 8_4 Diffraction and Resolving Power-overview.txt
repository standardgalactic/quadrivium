The text outlines a series of problems related to resolving power and diffraction effects in optics.

1. **Resolving Power of Stars:**
   - Two stars are 1.2 x 10^12 meters apart, observed at a wavelength of 515 nanometers using a telescope with a 1.02-meter lens.
   - The maximum distance at which these stars can still be resolved as separate is determined by the formula for the minimum resolvable angle (\(\theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \times \frac{\lambda}{D}\)).
   - This involves calculating the arc length corresponding to this angle and solving for the maximum distance.

2. **Inkjet Printer Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the maximum distance at which individual colored dots (red, green, blue) on printed paper are not resolved.
   - Using a pupil diameter of 3 mm and wavelengths for red (660 nm), green (550 nm), and blue (470 nm), the smallest wavelength (blue) provides the best resolution.
   - The calculation shows that to avoid resolving individual dots, they should be no further apart than 115 micrometers.

3. **Laser Beam to the Moon:**
   - A laser beam with a diameter of 0.2 meters and wavelength of 694.3 nm is sent to the moon (3.77 x 10^8 meters away).
   - The problem involves calculating the width of the central bright fringe when the beam reflects off the moon.
   - Using diffraction principles, specifically the angle to the first dark fringe (\(\theta = \arcsin(\frac{\lambda}{D})\)), the diameter of the central bright spot on the moon is calculated to be over 2.5 kilometers.

These problems illustrate applications of optical resolution and diffraction in different contexts, emphasizing calculations based on wavelength, aperture size, and distance.

The text discusses resolving power and diffraction problems related to optics.

1. **Resolving Two Stars:**
   - Given two stars 1.2 x 10^12 meters apart, observed with a telescope at a wavelength of 515 nanometers and lens diameter of 1.02 meters.
   - The resolving angle (\(\theta\)) is calculated using \(\theta = 1.22 \times \frac{\lambda}{d}\).
   - To find the maximum distance where stars are still resolvable, use \( \text{arc length} = \theta \times \text{distance}\).
   - Solve for distance: \(\text{distance} = \frac{\text{arc length} \times d}{1.22 \times \lambda}\).

2. **Inkjet Printer Problem:**
   - Viewing a printed page at 0.4 meters with an aperture diameter of 3 mm.
   - Different wavelengths for red (660 nm), green (550 nm), and blue (470 nm) light are considered.
   - The resolving power is best for the shortest wavelength, blue light.
   - Calculate maximum dot separation using \(\text{arc length} = 1.22 \times \frac{\lambda \times r}{d}\).
   - For blue: maximum separation is 115 micrometers to avoid resolving individual dots.

3. **Laser Beam to the Moon:**
   - Laser beam with a wavelength of 694.3 nm and diameter of 0.2 meters sent to the moon (distance 3.77 x 10^8 meters).
   - Calculate the width of the central bright fringe using diffraction.
   - \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{\lambda}{d}\), where \(m = 1\) for the first dark fringe.
   - Use \(\text{arc length} = 2 \times \theta \times \text{distance to moon}\).
   - Result: central bright fringe has a radius of about 2.62 x 10^3 meters (or 2.5 kilometers).

The text emphasizes using the diffraction limit formula and approximating distances with arc lengths for resolving power calculations in various scenarios.
