The text outlines a series of problems related to resolving power and diffraction effects in optics.

1. **Resolving Power of Stars:**
   - Two stars are 1.2 x 10^12 meters apart, observed at a wavelength of 515 nanometers using a telescope with a 1.02-meter lens.
   - The maximum distance at which these stars can still be resolved as separate is determined by the formula for the minimum resolvable angle (\(\theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \times \frac{\lambda}{D}\)).
   - This involves calculating the arc length corresponding to this angle and solving for the maximum distance.

2. **Inkjet Printer Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the maximum distance at which individual colored dots (red, green, blue) on printed paper are not resolved.
   - Using a pupil diameter of 3 mm and wavelengths for red (660 nm), green (550 nm), and blue (470 nm), the smallest wavelength (blue) provides the best resolution.
   - The calculation shows that to avoid resolving individual dots, they should be no further apart than 115 micrometers.

3. **Laser Beam to the Moon:**
   - A laser beam with a diameter of 0.2 meters and wavelength of 694.3 nm is sent to the moon (3.77 x 10^8 meters away).
   - The problem involves calculating the width of the central bright fringe when the beam reflects off the moon.
   - Using diffraction principles, specifically the angle to the first dark fringe (\(\theta = \arcsin(\frac{\lambda}{D})\)), the diameter of the central bright spot on the moon is calculated to be over 2.5 kilometers.

These problems illustrate applications of optical resolution and diffraction in different contexts, emphasizing calculations based on wavelength, aperture size, and distance.
