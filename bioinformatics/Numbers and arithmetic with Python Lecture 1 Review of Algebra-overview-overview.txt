## Arithmetic Operations in Python

In this section, we explore how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python. Understanding these operations is fundamental for manipulating numerical data and implementing mathematical logic.

### Addition

Addition in Python uses the `+` operator. It can add two or more numbers together seamlessly.

```python
# Example: Using addition
result1 = 3 + 4  # Outputs: 7
print(result1)

result2 = 3 + 4 + 5  # Outputs: 12
print(result2)
```

### Subtraction

Subtraction is performed using the `-` operator, allowing you to subtract one number from another.

```python
# Example: Using subtraction
result1 = 3 - 4  # Outputs: -1
print(result1)

result2 = 23 - 6 - 10  # Outputs: 7
print(result2)
```

### Multiplication

Multiplication in Python is done using the `*` operator, which multiplies two or more numbers.

```python
# Example: Using multiplication
result1 = 3 * 4  # Outputs: 12
print(result1)

result2 = 3 * 4 * 2  # Outputs: 24
print(result2)
```

### Summary

These basic arithmetic operations form the foundation of numerical computations in Python. Each operation supports chaining multiple numbers, allowing for complex expressions and calculations. As you advance, you'll also explore division, exponentiation, and other mathematical functions available in Python.

This Markdown format organizes your content into sections with headings, provides code snippets with explanations, and uses comments within the code to clarify each step. This structure is useful for educational purposes or documentation, making it easier for readers to follow along and understand how arithmetic operations work in Python.

Here's a summary of your text and an explanation of Python conditionals, including the commutative property:

### Summary of Text

1. **Division in Python**:
   - Division is performed using the `/` operator.
   - The result is a floating-point number.
   - Examples:
     ```python
     10 / 2  # Outputs: 5.0
     10 / 2 / 5  # Outputs: 1.0
     ```

2. **Tips for Organizing Notebooks**:
   - Use markdown cells with headers to organize sections, allowing easy collapsing and expanding.
   - Separate code cells for each arithmetic operation enhance clarity.
   - Include comments within code cells for explanations.

3. **Example Notebook Structure**:
   - Sections are organized under headings like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, each demonstrating operations in separate code blocks.

### Python Conditionals

Conditionals test whether a statement is true or false using comparison operators:

- `==`: Equality
- `!=`: Inequality
- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`: Comparisons for less than, greater than, etc.
  
These comparisons yield Boolean values: `True` or `False`.

### Commutative Property

The commutative property states that the order of numbers does not affect the result for some operations:

- **Addition**: 
  - \(3 + 4\) is equal to \(4 + 3\). (True)
  
- **Multiplication**:
  - \(3 \times 4\) is equal to \(4 \times 3\). (True)

- **Subtraction**:
  - \(3 - 4\) is not equal to \(4 - 3\). (False)

The commutative property does not apply to subtraction and division. Understanding these concepts helps in writing efficient and correct conditional logic in Python programming.

The provided text explores mathematical properties such as commutativity and associativity using Python, with additional insights into handling fractions via the Sympy library. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main points:

### Mathematical Properties in Python

1. **Commutative Property**:
   - True for addition and multiplication but not for subtraction or division.
   - Example: \(3 + 4 = 4 + 3\) (True), whereas \(3 / 4 \neq 4 / 3\) (False).

2. **Associative Property**:
   - Holds for addition and multiplication, meaning grouping does not affect the result.
   - Example: \((3 * 4) * 5 = 3 * (4 * 5)\) (True).

### Using Python Conditionals

Python conditionals can be used to verify these properties:

- **Commutative Addition**: 
  ```python
  is_commutative_addition = (3 + 4) == (4 + 3)
  print(is_commutative_addition)  # True
  ```

- **Associative Multiplication**:
  ```python
  is_associative_multiplication = ((3 * 4) * 5) == (3 * (4 * 5))
  print(is_associative_multiplication)  # True
  ```

### Non-Commutative Operations

Operations like subtraction and division do not satisfy the commutative property:

- **Subtraction**: \((3 - 4) \neq (4 - 3)\)
- **Division**: \((3 / 4) \neq (4 / 3)\)

### Introduction to Sympy for Fractions

The text introduces using Sympy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, particularly for handling fractions:

1. **Fraction Handling**:
   - Create and simplify fractions with `Rational(numerator, denominator)` or `simplify()`.

2. **Comparisons and Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Compare fractions (e.g., \(\frac{3}{8} < \frac{3}{5}\)).
   - Perform operations like addition and multiplication on fractions to get exact results.

3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - Useful for finding common denominators when adding fractions, a feature not available in base Python but provided by Sympy.

4. **Remainders**:
   - Use the `mod` function to find remainders in division operations.

### Conclusion

The text emphasizes hands-on learning through coding to explore mathematical concepts. It encourages experimentation with Sympy for further exploration of fractions and other mathematical computations, highlighting Python as a tool for both understanding and applying mathematical principles.
