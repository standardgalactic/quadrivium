To find the second derivative \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \) for the parametric equations given by:

\[ x = r \cos(t), \]
\[ y = r \sin(t), \]

we start with the first derivative, which is derived from:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
\]

Calculating these derivatives:

- \( \frac{dy}{dt} = r \cos(t) \)
- \( \frac{dx}{dt} = -r \sin(t) \)

Thus, the first derivative is:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{r \cos(t)}{-r \sin(t)} = -\cot(t)
\]

Now, to find the second derivative \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \), we use the formula:

\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) \div \frac{dx}{dt}
\]

First, differentiate \( \frac{dy}{dx} = -\cot(t) \) with respect to \( t \):

\[
\frac{d}{dt}(-\cot(t)) = \csc^2(t)
\]

Now, divide by \( \frac{dx}{dt} = -r \sin(t) \):

\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{\csc^2(t)}{-r \sin(t)}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -\frac{1}{r \sin^3(t)}
\]

This is the expression for the second derivative \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \) in terms of the parameter \( t \).

Certainly! Let's break down the process of finding the second derivative \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \) using the quotient rule for parametric equations.

### Given:
- Parametric equations: \( x = f(t) \) and \( y = g(t) \).
- First derivatives: \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}} \).

### Objective:
Find the second derivative \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \).

### Steps:

1. **First Derivative**:
   - Let \( u = \frac{dy}{dt} \) and \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} \).
   - First derivative: \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{u}{v} \).

2. **Quotient Rule for Second Derivative**:
   - To find \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \), use the formula:
     \[
     \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
     \]
   - Apply the quotient rule to \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{u}{v} \):
     \[
     \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{u}{v}\right) = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}
     \]

3. **Substitute and Simplify**:
   - Substitute \( u' = \frac{du}{dt} \), \( v' = \frac{dv}{dt} \).
   - The second derivative becomes:
     \[
     \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{\left(\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}\right)}{v}
     \]
   - Simplify to:
     \[
     \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^3}
     \]

### Example:

Suppose \( x = t^3 + 1 \) and \( y = t^7 + t \).

- Compute derivatives:
  - \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 3t^2 \)
  - \( \frac{dy}{dt} = 7t^6 + 1 \)

- First derivative:
  \[
  \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{7t^6 + 1}{3t^2}
  \]

- Apply quotient rule for second derivative:
  - \( u = 7t^6 + 1 \), \( v = 3t^2 \)
  - \( u' = 42t^5 \), \( v' = 6t \)

- Second derivative:
  \[
  \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{(42t^5)(3t^2) - (7t^6 + 1)(6t)}{(3t^2)^3}
  \]

- Simplify:
  \[
  = \frac{126t^7 - (42t^7 + 6t)}{27t^6}
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{84t^7 - 6t}{27t^6}
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{6(14t^6 - 1)}{27t^6}
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{2(14t^6 - 1)}{9t^6}
  \]

This is the simplified form of \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \). Practicing these steps with different parametric equations will solidify your understanding.

To solve for \( t \) in the equation derived from the parametric equations given, let's first outline what you've provided:

We have:
- \( x(t) = t^2 + e^t \)
- \( y(t) = t + e^t \)

You are asked to find the value of \( t \) at which the point on the curve is \((x, y) = (1, 1)\). Therefore, we have:
\[ t^2 + e^t = 1 \]
\[ t + e^t = 1 \]

By subtracting the second equation from the first, you correctly identified that:
\[ t^2 - t = 0 \]

This can be factored as:
\[ t(t - 1) = 0 \]

Thus, \( t = 0 \) or \( t = 1 \).

Now, we need to check which of these values satisfies both original equations.

**For \( t = 0 \):**
- \( x(0) = 0^2 + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
- \( y(0) = 0 + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1 \)

Both conditions are satisfied, so \( t = 0 \) is a valid solution.

**For \( t = 1 \):**
- \( x(1) = 1^2 + e^1 = 1 + e \)
- \( y(1) = 1 + e^1 = 1 + e \)

Here, neither condition is satisfied because both result in values greater than 1.

Therefore, the only value of \( t \) that satisfies both parametric equations at the point \((1, 1)\) is \( t = 0 \).

Now, to find the slope of the curve at this point, we use the formula for the derivative of a parametric equation:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
\]

Calculate \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dx}{dt}\):

- \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 1 + e^t\)
- \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 2t + e^t\)

Substitute \( t = 0 \):

- \(\frac{dy}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2\)
- \(\frac{dx}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = 2(0) + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1\)

Thus, the slope at \( t = 0 \) is:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx}\bigg|_{t=0} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
\]

So, the slope of the curve at the point \((1, 1)\) is 2.

To find where the curve has a vertical tangent line, you need to look for points where the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) approaches infinity. This typically happens when the denominator of the derivative is zero while the numerator is non-zero.

Given the parametric equations:
- \( x(t) = 2\cos(t) + \sin(2t) \)
- \( y(t) = 2\sin(t) + \cos(2t) \)

The derivatives are:
- \( \frac{dx}{dt} = -2\sin(t) + 2\cos(2t) \)
- \( \frac{dy}{dt} = 2\cos(t) - 2\sin(2t) \)

The derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is given by:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}} = \frac{2\cos(t) - 2\sin(2t)}{-2\sin(t) + 2\cos(2t)} \]

For a vertical tangent line, \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \) and \( \frac{dy}{dt} \neq 0 \).

1. **Find where \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \):**

   \[
   -2\sin(t) + 2\cos(2t) = 0
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \sin(t) = \cos(2t)
   \]

   Using the identity \( \cos(2t) = 1 - 2\sin^2(t) \), we have:
   \[
   \sin(t) = 1 - 2\sin^2(t)
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   2\sin^2(t) + \sin(t) - 1 = 0
   \]

   Solving this quadratic equation in terms of \( \sin(t) \):
   \[
   \sin(t) = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{4} = \frac{-1 \pm 3}{4}
   \]
   So, \( \sin(t) = \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \sin(t) = -1 \).

2. **Check where \( \frac{dy}{dt} \neq 0 \):**

   For \( \sin(t) = \frac{1}{2} \), \( t = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2\pi n \) or \( t = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi n \).

   For \( \sin(t) = -1 \), \( t = \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2\pi n \).

   Calculate \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) for these values to ensure it's non-zero.

3. **Find the corresponding points:**

   Substitute these \( t \)-values back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates:

   - For \( t = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2\pi n \):
     \[
     x = 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     y = 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}
     \]

   - For \( t = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi n \):
     \[
     x = 2\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{3}\right)
     \]
     \[
     y = 2\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{3}\right)
     \]

   - For \( t = \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2\pi n \):
     \[
     x = 2\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) + \sin(3\pi) = 0
     \]
     \[
     y = 2\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) + \cos(3\pi) = -2 - 1 = -3
     \]

Thus, the curve has a vertical tangent line at \( (0, -3) \).

Let's break down your discussion into several key points regarding parametric curves, differentiation, integration, and area calculation.

### Parametric Curves

Parametric equations describe a curve by defining both \( x \) and \( y \) as functions of a third variable, typically denoted as \( t \). In your example:

- \( x(t) = 2\cos(t) + \sin(2t) \)
- \( y(t) = 2\sin(t) + \cos(2t) \)

These equations define the path traced by a point as \( t \) varies over some interval, here from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \).

### Differentiation

To find the derivative of \( x \) with respect to \( t \), denoted as \( dx/dt \), you differentiate each term:

- The derivative of \( 2\cos(t) \) is \( -2\sin(t) \).
- The derivative of \( \sin(2t) \) using the chain rule is \( 2\cos(2t) \).

Thus, 

\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = -2\sin(t) + 2\cos(2t). \]

### Integration for Area

The area \( A \) enclosed by a parametric curve can be found using the integral:

\[ A = \int_{c}^{d} y(t) \frac{dx}{dt} \, dt. \]

This formula is derived from the single-variable calculus concept of finding the area under a curve, adapted for parametric equations.

### Calculating the Area

1. **Substitute \( y(t) \) and \( dx/dt \):**

   - \( y(t) = 2\sin(t) + \cos(2t) \)
   - \( \frac{dx}{dt} = -2\sin(t) + 2\cos(2t) \)

2. **Set up the integral:**

   \[
   A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left( 2\sin(t) + \cos(2t) \right) \left( -2\sin(t) + 2\cos(2t) \right) \, dt.
   \]

3. **Expand the integrand:**

   \[
   A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left[ -4\sin^2(t) + 4\sin(t)\cos(2t) - 2\cos(2t)\sin(t) + 2\cos^2(2t) \right] \, dt.
   \]

4. **Simplify and integrate:**

   This step involves using trigonometric identities to simplify the expression where possible and then integrating term by term.

### Direction of Traversal

The direction in which you traverse the curve (clockwise or counterclockwise) affects the sign of the area:

- If the traversal is clockwise, the integral gives a negative value for the area.
- If counterclockwise, it gives a positive value.

To ensure clockwise traversal, you might need to adjust the limits of integration or reverse the parametrization.

### Using Computer Algebra Systems

For complex integrals, especially those involving trigonometric identities and products, using a computer algebra system like WolframAlpha can save time and reduce errors. You input the integral directly:

\[ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left( 2\sin(t) + \cos(2t) \right) \left( -2\sin(t) + 2\cos(2t) \right) \, dt \]

This will compute the area enclosed by the parametric curve for you.

### Conclusion

Understanding how to differentiate and integrate parametric equations is crucial for calculating areas under curves defined this way. Remember to consider the direction of traversal when interpreting the result of your integral. Using technology can be a helpful aid in handling complex calculations efficiently.

It looks like you are working through a problem involving parametric curves and calculating the area enclosed by these curves using integration. Let’s break down your process and ensure everything aligns with standard calculus approaches:

### Understanding Parametric Curves

A parametric curve in the plane is defined by two functions, \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), where \( t \) is a parameter that typically varies over an interval \([a, b]\). The area enclosed by such a curve can be found using the following integral formula:

\[
A = \int_{a}^{b} y(t) \cdot x'(t) \, dt
\]

where \( x'(t) \) is the derivative of \( x(t) \) with respect to \( t \).

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Ellipse Area Calculation:**
   - You have a parametric form for an ellipse:
     \[
     x(t) = a \cos(t), \quad y(t) = b \sin(t)
     \]
   - The area enclosed by this curve is calculated as:
     \[
     A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} b \sin(t) \cdot (-a \sin(t)) \, dt = ab \int_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^2(t) \, dt
     \]
   - Using the identity \( \cos^2(t) = \frac{1 + \cos(2t)}{2} \), you integrate to find:
     \[
     A = ab \left[ \frac{t}{2} + \frac{\sin(2t)}{4} \right]_{0}^{2\pi} = ab \cdot \pi
     \]

2. **Cardioid Area Calculation:**
   - For the parametric curve:
     \[
     x(t) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(t) - \frac{1}{4} \cos(2t), \quad y(t) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(t) - \frac{1}{4} \sin(2t)
     \]
   - Calculate \( x'(t) \):
     \[
     x'(t) = -\frac{1}{2} \sin(t) + \frac{1}{2} \sin(2t)
     \]
   - The area is then:
     \[
     A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(\frac{1}{2} \sin(t) - \frac{1}{4} \sin(2t)\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2} \sin(t) + \frac{1}{2} \sin(2t)\right) \, dt
     \]
   - Simplify and integrate:
     \[
     A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(\frac{1}{4} \sin^2(t) - \frac{1}{4} \sin(t)\sin(2t) + \frac{1}{8} \sin(2t)\sin(t) - \frac{1}{8} \sin^2(2t)\right) \, dt
     \]
   - Use trigonometric identities to simplify the integrand and evaluate the integral.

### Important Considerations

- **Orientation:** Ensure that the curve is traversed in the correct direction (usually counterclockwise for positive area).
- **Interval:** Confirm the interval over which \( t \) varies, typically from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \) unless specified otherwise.
- **Software Tools:** Using tools like WolframAlpha or a similar computational tool can help verify your calculations.

By following these steps and considerations, you should be able to accurately determine the area enclosed by any given parametric curve. If you have specific questions about parts of this process, feel free to ask!

The text provides an overview of calculating areas enclosed by parametric curves, highlighting methods and examples. It emphasizes using integration with respect to parameter \( t \) for curves defined parametrically by \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \).

1. **Counterclockwise Curves**: For counterclockwise curves, the area is calculated using:
   \[
   A = \int_{c}^{d} y(t) \frac{dx}{dt} \, dt
   \]
   The text illustrates cleaning up notation and integrating with respect to \( t \).

2. **Clockwise Curves**: For clockwise curves, the formula remains similar but acknowledges directionality:
   \[
   A = \int_{c}^{d} y(t) \frac{dx}{dt} \, dt
   \]
   The sign of \( \frac{dx}{dt} \) may be negative due to direction.

3. **Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: A parametric curve defined by cosine and sine functions is evaluated for area using integration.
   - **Example 2**: Another curve, defined by polynomials \( x(t) = t^4 - 1 \) and \( y(t) = 3t^2 - 4 \), is integrated from \( t = -2 \) to \( t = 2 \).

The text encourages using computational tools like the Wolfram language for solving integrals but also suggests manual calculation as a challenge. It aims to build appreciation for parametric curves and their applications in calculus beyond single-variable contexts.
