The text describes how to calculate the work done by a force field on a particle moving along a specific path. The problem involves a curve \( C \) in three-dimensional space given by the parametric equation \( xyz = t^2t \), where \( t \) ranges from 0 to infinity. However, for practical purposes, the particle only moves along a line segment from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1).

The force field is represented as a vector function: \((xy, y, -yz)\). The task is to compute the work done by this force field over the specified path. This involves setting up and evaluating a line integral of the form \(\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}\), where \(\mathbf{F}\) is the force vector and \(d\mathbf{r}\) is the differential displacement vector.

The path is parametrized as \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t, t)\) for \(t\) from 0 to 1. The derivative of this parametrization with respect to \(t\) is \(\mathbf{r}'(t) = (1, 1, 1)\).

The force vector along the path becomes \((t^2, t, -t^2)\). The work done is calculated by evaluating the line integral:

\[
\int_0^1 (t^2, t, -t^2) \cdot (1, 1, 1) \, dt = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t - t^2) \, dt = \int_0^1 t \, dt
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left[ \frac{1}{2}t^2 \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the work done by the force field along the specified path is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

The text discusses calculating the work done by a force field along a specific line segment in three-dimensional space. The curve \( C \) is defined by the parametric equations \( x = t \), \( y = t \), and \( z = t \) with \( t \) ranging from 0 to 1, rather than from 0 to infinity. This adjustment avoids dealing with a divergent improper integral.

The force field given is represented as the vector function \( \mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = (xy, y, -yz) \). To find the work done by this force along the line segment, we use the line integral of the dot product of the force field and the differential displacement vector.

The parametrization for the path is \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t, t) \), with \( t \) ranging from 0 to 1. The derivative of this parametrized path with respect to \( t \) is \( \mathbf{r}'(t) = (1, 1, 1) \).

Substituting into the force field, we get:
- \( F(x, y, z) = (t^2, t, -t^2) \)

The work done is calculated as:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (t^2, t, -t^2) \cdot (1, 1, 1) \, dt
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (t^2 \cdot 1 + t \cdot 1 - t^2 \cdot 1) \, dt = \int_{0}^{1} t \, dt
\]

Evaluating this integral gives:
\[
\left[ \frac{1}{2} t^2 \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the work done by the force field along the specified path is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
