The text describes how to calculate the work done by a force field on a particle moving along a specific path. The problem involves a curve \( C \) in three-dimensional space given by the parametric equation \( xyz = t^2t \), where \( t \) ranges from 0 to infinity. However, for practical purposes, the particle only moves along a line segment from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1).

The force field is represented as a vector function: \((xy, y, -yz)\). The task is to compute the work done by this force field over the specified path. This involves setting up and evaluating a line integral of the form \(\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}\), where \(\mathbf{F}\) is the force vector and \(d\mathbf{r}\) is the differential displacement vector.

The path is parametrized as \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t, t)\) for \(t\) from 0 to 1. The derivative of this parametrization with respect to \(t\) is \(\mathbf{r}'(t) = (1, 1, 1)\).

The force vector along the path becomes \((t^2, t, -t^2)\). The work done is calculated by evaluating the line integral:

\[
\int_0^1 (t^2, t, -t^2) \cdot (1, 1, 1) \, dt = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t - t^2) \, dt = \int_0^1 t \, dt
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left[ \frac{1}{2}t^2 \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the work done by the force field along the specified path is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
