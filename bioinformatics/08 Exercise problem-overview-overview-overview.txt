The text provides a proof for the associative property of set intersections by showing that for any sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), the expressions \( (A \cap B) \cap C \) and \( A \cap (B \cap C) \) are equal. The proof is conducted in two parts:

1. **First Direction:** An element \( X \) in \( (A \cap B) \cap C \) implies that \( X \in A \), \( X \in B \), and \( X \in C \). Hence, \( X \) must also be in \( B \cap C \), leading to \( X \in A \cap (B \cap C) \). This establishes that \( (A \cap B) \cap C \subseteq A \cap (B \cap C) \).

2. **Second Direction:** An element \( X \) in \( A \cap (B \cap C) \) indicates that \( X \in A \) and \( X \in B \cap C \), which means \( X \in B \) and \( X \in C \). Thus, \( X \in A \cap B \), and since \( X \in C \), it follows that \( X \in (A \cap B) \cap C \). This shows that \( A \cap (B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cap C \).

Since both subset relations are proven, the sets are equal: \( (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C) \). The proof relies on the definitions of set intersection and equality.
