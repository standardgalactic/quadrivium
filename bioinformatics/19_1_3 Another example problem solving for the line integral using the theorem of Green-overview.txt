It looks like you're working through a problem involving line integrals and Green's Theorem. Let's break down the key points:

### Problem Setup

1. **Line Integral**: You are evaluating a line integral around a closed curve \( C \) with vector field components:
   - \( m = x - y \)
   - \( n = xy \)

2. **Curve Description**: The path \( C \) is composed of three segments:
   - From (0, 0) to (1, 3) along the line \( y = 3x \).
   - From (1, 3) to (1, 0) vertically.
   - From (1, 0) back to (0, 0) horizontally.

### Direct Calculation of Line Integral

You calculated the line integral directly by breaking it into three segments:

- **Segment 1**: \( y = 3x \), from (0, 0) to (1, 3).
- **Segment 2**: Vertical line from (1, 3) to (1, 0).
- **Segment 3**: Horizontal line from (1, 0) to (0, 0).

For each segment, you calculated:

\[ \int_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \int_{C_1} (m \, dx + n \, dy) + \int_{C_2} (m \, dx + n \, dy) + \int_{C_3} (m \, dx + n \, dy) \]

The results for each segment were:
- Segment 1: \(-2\)
- Segment 2: \(+\frac{1}{2}\)
- Segment 3: \(+\frac{9}{2}\)

Adding these gives the total line integral as \(3\).

### Using Green's Theorem

Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve \( C \) to a double integral over the region \( R \) it encloses:

\[ \oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \right) dA \]

1. **Curl Calculation**:
   - \( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} = y \)
   - \( \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = -1 \)

   So, the curl is \( y + 1 \).

2. **Region Description**: The region \( R \) is bounded by:
   - \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \)
   - \( 0 \leq y \leq 3x \)

3. **Double Integral**:

\[ \iint_R (y + 1) \, dA = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{3x} (y + 1) \, dy \, dx \]

   - Integrate with respect to \( y \):
     \[
     \int_{0}^{3x} (y + 1) \, dy = \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} + y \right]_{0}^{3x} = \frac{(3x)^2}{2} + 3x = \frac{9x^2}{2} + 3x
     \]

   - Integrate with respect to \( x \):
     \[
     \int_{0}^{1} \left( \frac{9x^2}{2} + 3x \right) \, dx = \left[ \frac{9x^3}{6} + \frac{3x^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3
     \]

Both methods give the same result: \(3\). This confirms that your calculations are consistent and correct.

Let's break down the problem and solution step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

You are given a vector field \(\mathbf{F} = (m, n) = (x - y, x + y)\). You need to compute the line integral of this vector field around a closed curve \(C\) using both direct computation and Green's Theorem.

The curve \(C\) is defined by:
1. From \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 3)\) along the line \(y = 3x\).
2. From \((1, 3)\) to \((1, 0)\) vertically.
3. From \((1, 0)\) back to \((0, 0)\) horizontally.

### Direct Computation of Line Integral

The line integral of \(\mathbf{F}\) around \(C\) is given by:

\[
\oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy)
\]

#### Segment 1: From \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 3)\)

- Parametrize: \(x = t\), \(y = 3t\), where \(t\) goes from 0 to 1.
- Then \(dx = dt\), \(dy = 3dt\).
- The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^1 [(t - 3t) \, dt + (t + 3t) \cdot 3 \, dt] = \int_0^1 [-2t \, dt + 12t \, dt]
\]

\[
= \int_0^1 10t \, dt = [5t^2]_0^1 = 5
\]

#### Segment 2: From \((1, 3)\) to \((1, 0)\)

- Parametrize: \(x = 1\), \(y = t\), where \(t\) goes from 3 to 0.
- Then \(dx = 0\), \(dy = dt\).
- The integral becomes:

\[
\int_3^0 [(1 - t) \cdot 0 + (1 + t) \, dt] = \int_3^0 (1 + t) \, dt
\]

\[
= [-t^2/2 + t]_3^0 = [0 - (9/2 - 3)] = -3/2
\]

#### Segment 3: From \((1, 0)\) to \((0, 0)\)

- Parametrize: \(x = t\), \(y = 0\), where \(t\) goes from 1 to 0.
- Then \(dx = dt\), \(dy = 0\).
- The integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^0 [(t - 0) \, dt + (t + 0) \cdot 0] = \int_1^0 t \, dt
\]

\[
= [-t^2/2]_1^0 = [0 - (-1/2)] = 1/2
\]

### Total Line Integral

Adding the results from each segment:

\[
5 + (-3/2) + (1/2) = 5 - 3/2 + 1/2 = 5 - 2 = 3
\]

### Using Green's Theorem

Green's Theorem states:

\[
\oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \right) \, dA
\]

For \(\mathbf{F} = (x - y, x + y)\):

- \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial x} = 1\)
- \(\frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = -1\)

So the curl is:

\[
\frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = 1 + 1 = 2
\]

The region \(R\) is bounded by \(y = 3x\), \(x = 1\), and the x-axis.

### Double Integral

Set up the double integral:

\[
\iint_R 2 \, dA = \int_0^1 \int_0^{3x} 2 \, dy \, dx
\]

Evaluate the inner integral:

\[
\int_0^{3x} 2 \, dy = [2y]_0^{3x} = 6x
\]

Now evaluate the outer integral:

\[
\int_0^1 6x \, dx = [3x^2]_0^1 = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Both methods give the same result for the line integral around \(C\):

\[
\oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = 3
\]
