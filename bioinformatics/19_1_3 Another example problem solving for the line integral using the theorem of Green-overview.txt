It looks like you're working through a problem involving line integrals and Green's Theorem. Let's break down the key points:

### Problem Setup

1. **Line Integral**: You are evaluating a line integral around a closed curve \( C \) with vector field components:
   - \( m = x - y \)
   - \( n = xy \)

2. **Curve Description**: The path \( C \) is composed of three segments:
   - From (0, 0) to (1, 3) along the line \( y = 3x \).
   - From (1, 3) to (1, 0) vertically.
   - From (1, 0) back to (0, 0) horizontally.

### Direct Calculation of Line Integral

You calculated the line integral directly by breaking it into three segments:

- **Segment 1**: \( y = 3x \), from (0, 0) to (1, 3).
- **Segment 2**: Vertical line from (1, 3) to (1, 0).
- **Segment 3**: Horizontal line from (1, 0) to (0, 0).

For each segment, you calculated:

\[ \int_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \int_{C_1} (m \, dx + n \, dy) + \int_{C_2} (m \, dx + n \, dy) + \int_{C_3} (m \, dx + n \, dy) \]

The results for each segment were:
- Segment 1: \(-2\)
- Segment 2: \(+\frac{1}{2}\)
- Segment 3: \(+\frac{9}{2}\)

Adding these gives the total line integral as \(3\).

### Using Green's Theorem

Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve \( C \) to a double integral over the region \( R \) it encloses:

\[ \oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \right) dA \]

1. **Curl Calculation**:
   - \( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} = y \)
   - \( \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = -1 \)

   So, the curl is \( y + 1 \).

2. **Region Description**: The region \( R \) is bounded by:
   - \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \)
   - \( 0 \leq y \leq 3x \)

3. **Double Integral**:

\[ \iint_R (y + 1) \, dA = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{3x} (y + 1) \, dy \, dx \]

   - Integrate with respect to \( y \):
     \[
     \int_{0}^{3x} (y + 1) \, dy = \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} + y \right]_{0}^{3x} = \frac{(3x)^2}{2} + 3x = \frac{9x^2}{2} + 3x
     \]

   - Integrate with respect to \( x \):
     \[
     \int_{0}^{1} \left( \frac{9x^2}{2} + 3x \right) \, dx = \left[ \frac{9x^3}{6} + \frac{3x^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3
     \]

Both methods give the same result: \(3\). This confirms that your calculations are consistent and correct.
