The text explains how to express the dot product of two vectors using a matrix equation. Given two vectors \(\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2)\) and \(\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2)\), you can write them as column vectors:

\[
\mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

To find the dot product using a matrix approach, take the transpose of vector \(\mathbf{v}\):

\[
\mathbf{v}^T = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 & v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Multiply this transposed row vector by the column vector \(\mathbf{u}\):

\[
\mathbf{v}^T \cdot \mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 & v_2 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{bmatrix} = v_1u_1 + v_2u_2
\]

This result, \(v_1u_1 + v_2u_2\), is the dot product of vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\). Therefore, the matrix equation for the dot product is:

\[
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}^T \cdot \mathbf{u}
\]
