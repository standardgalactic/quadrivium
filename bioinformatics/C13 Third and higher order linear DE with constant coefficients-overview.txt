The text discusses solving differential equations by finding solutions related to their auxiliary (characteristic) equations, particularly when dealing with orders higher than 2. In these cases, you work with derivatives represented as \( y', y'', \) etc., and denote powers of derivatives using brackets.

When constructing the solution for the differential equation, consider the roots of the auxiliary equation:
- If the roots are real and distinct (e.g., \( m_1, m_2, m_3 \)), the general solution involves terms like \( c_1 e^{m_1 x}, c_2 e^{m_2 x}, \) etc.
- For repeated roots (where all roots equal, say \( m_1 = m_2 = m_3 \)), the solution includes terms with increasing powers of \( x \): \( c_1 e^{m_1 x}, c_2 x e^{m_1 x}, c_3 x^2 e^{m_1 x} \), and so on, up to \( (k-1) \)-th power where \( k \) is the multiplicity of the repeated root.

The text emphasizes focusing only on real roots for this course and notes that complex conjugate roots will not be considered. The discussion includes understanding how these solutions form based on whether roots are distinct or repeated, using an example to further illustrate these concepts in a subsequent video.

The text provides guidance on solving higher-order differential equations using auxiliary functions. Here's a summary:

1. **Auxiliary Function Format**: When dealing with derivatives of orders higher than 2, the auxiliary function is expressed as \( y, y', \ldots \). This notation helps avoid confusion that might arise from misinterpreting powers (e.g., \( y^4 \) vs. \( (y')^4 \)).

2. **Roots and Solutions**:
   - Focus on real distinct roots and real equal roots.
   - For distinct roots, the solution involves terms like \( c_1 e^{m_1 x}, c_2 e^{m_2 x}, \ldots \).
   - For repeated (equal) roots, solutions include polynomial terms multiplied by exponentials: \( c_1 e^{m_1 x}, c_2 x e^{m_1 x}, c_3 x^2 e^{m_1 x}, \ldots \), up to \( (x^{k-1} e^{m_1 x}) \).

3. **Explanation of Terms**:
   - The auxiliary equation is set up such that each distinct root contributes an exponential term.
   - For repeated roots, the powers of \( x \) increase from 0 up to one less than the multiplicity of the root.

4. **Practical Application**: The text suggests looking at examples in subsequent materials for better understanding and application.

The explanation emphasizes understanding the structure of solutions based on the nature of the roots (distinct or equal) of the auxiliary equation derived from higher-order differential equations.
