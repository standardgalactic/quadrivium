The text discusses solving differential equations by finding solutions related to their auxiliary (characteristic) equations, particularly when dealing with orders higher than 2. In these cases, you work with derivatives represented as \( y', y'', \) etc., and denote powers of derivatives using brackets.

When constructing the solution for the differential equation, consider the roots of the auxiliary equation:
- If the roots are real and distinct (e.g., \( m_1, m_2, m_3 \)), the general solution involves terms like \( c_1 e^{m_1 x}, c_2 e^{m_2 x}, \) etc.
- For repeated roots (where all roots equal, say \( m_1 = m_2 = m_3 \)), the solution includes terms with increasing powers of \( x \): \( c_1 e^{m_1 x}, c_2 x e^{m_1 x}, c_3 x^2 e^{m_1 x} \), and so on, up to \( (k-1) \)-th power where \( k \) is the multiplicity of the repeated root.

The text emphasizes focusing only on real roots for this course and notes that complex conjugate roots will not be considered. The discussion includes understanding how these solutions form based on whether roots are distinct or repeated, using an example to further illustrate these concepts in a subsequent video.
