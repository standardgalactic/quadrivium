The text provides an introduction to complex numbers, highlighting their application as vectors in linear algebra:

1. **Imaginary Unit \(i\)**: Introduced in the 18th century, \(i\) is defined such that \(i^2 = -1\), allowing solutions to equations like \(x^2 = -1\).

2. **Complex Numbers**: These are expressed as \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers.

3. **Representation**:
   - As ordered pairs \((a, b)\).
   - On the Argand diagram (complex plane) with a horizontal real axis and vertical imaginary axis.
   - As vectors or points on this complex plane.

4. **Equality**: Two complex numbers \(a + bi\) and \(c + di\) are equal if \(a = c\) and \(b = d\).

5. **Real and Pure Imaginary Numbers**:
   - Real numbers lie along the x-axis (\(a + 0i\)).
   - Pure imaginary numbers lie along the y-axis (\(0 + bi\)).

6. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Addition: \((a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i\).
   - Subtraction: Similar to addition, but with subtraction.
   - Scalar Multiplication: \(k(a + bi) = ka + kbi\).

The text uses examples of specific complex numbers \(z_1 = 4 - 5i\) and \(z_2 = -1 + 6i\) for operations:

- **Addition**: \(z_1 + z_2 = (4 - 1) + (-5i + 6i) = 3 + i\).
- **Subtraction**: \(z_1 - z_2 = (4 - (-1)) + (-5i - 6i) = 5 - 11i\).
- **Scalar Multiplication**:
  - \(3 \times z_1 = 12 - 15i\).
  - \(-1 \times z_2 = 1 - 6i\).

These concepts establish the groundwork for using complex numbers as vectors in linear algebra, enabling various operations and analyses. The text concludes with some unrelated commentary that may contain errors or language issues.
