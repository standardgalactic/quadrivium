This video series outlines how to sketch the graph of the function \( f(x) = 3x - x^3 \) using derivatives. Here's a brief summary:

1. **Discontinuities and Endpoints:**
   - The function is continuous with no discontinuities.
   - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( y \to +\infty \); as \( x \to +\infty \), \( y \to -\infty \).
   - X-intercepts are at \( x = -\sqrt{3}, 0, \sqrt{3} \) and the Y-intercept is at \( (0,0) \).

2. **Turning Points:**
   - First derivative: \( f'(x) = 3 - 3x^2 \).
   - Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \), turning points are found at \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \).
   - Corresponding y-values are \( (-1, -2) \) and \( (1, 2) \).

3. **Intervals of Increase/Decrease:**
   - The function is decreasing for \( x < -1 \), increasing for \( -1 < x < 1 \), and decreasing again for \( x > 1 \).

4. **Concavity and Inflection Points:**
   - Second derivative: \( f''(x) = -6x \).
   - Inflection point at \( x = 0 \).
   - Concave up for \( x < 0 \), concave down for \( x > 0 \).

5. **Graph Sketching:**
   - The graph starts by decreasing from the top left, turns upward at \( (-1, -2) \), peaks at \( (1, 2) \), and has an inflection point at \( (0, 0) \).
   - It then continues to decrease towards the bottom right. 

The sketch incorporates these characteristics for a complete graph representation.
