The text introduces key concepts from Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, focusing on degrees of freedom, which are essential for describing a system's state in classical Newtonian dynamics. It explains that:

1. **Degrees of Freedom**: 
   - A single particle moving along one axis has one degree of freedom.
   - In three-dimensional space (x, y, z), each particle contributes three degrees of freedom.

2. **Multiple Particles**:
   - For \( N \) particles in three-dimensional space, the total degrees of freedom are calculated as \( 3N \).

3. **Constraints**: 
   - Constraints reduce the system's degrees of freedom by imposing conditions on how particles move relative to each other.
   - An example is maintaining a fixed distance between two particles, which reduces their combined six degrees of freedom in three-dimensional space to five.

4. **Rigid Bodies**:
   - A rigid body maintains constant distances between its constituent particles despite vibrations.
   - Calculating constraints involves the formula \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of particles, though redundancy must be considered to avoid negative degrees of freedom.

5. **Degrees of Freedom for Rigid Bodies**:
   - A rigid body has six degrees of freedom: three translational (movement of the center of mass) and three rotational (orientation in space).

Understanding these concepts is crucial for setting up dynamic equations and solving physical problems involving both individual particles and rigid bodies.
