The lecture covers the classification of data types essential for statistical analysis, dividing them into two primary categories: categorical and numerical.

1. **Categorical Data Types**:
   - *Nominal*: Labels without inherent order (e.g., disease names).
   - *Ordinal*: Ordered but without equal intervals (e.g., survey rankings).

2. **Numerical Data Types**:
   - *Interval*: No absolute zero, differences are meaningful (e.g., Celsius temperature).
   - *Ratio*: Has an absolute zero, allowing for magnitude comparisons (e.g., hemoglobin levels).

Additionally, numerical data is further divided into:
- **Discrete Data**: Distinct values with no intermediates (e.g., coin flips).
- **Continuous Data**: Can be infinitely subdivided (e.g., blood cell counts, financial figures).

The lecture notes that while distinctions between discrete and continuous data can sometimes blur in practical contexts, understanding these types is crucial for appropriate analysis. Key statistical tests mentioned include the chi-squared test for categorical data and the t-test for ratio type numerical data. The text emphasizes the importance of reviewing these concepts to ensure accurate data analysis in research settings.
