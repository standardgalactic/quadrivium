The text discusses the transition from analyzing an oscillatory motion with damping to incorporating an external driving force into a mass-spring system. Initially, the system's equation of motion includes terms for mass (\( m \)), damping coefficient (\( c \)), and spring constant (\( k \)) along with an external driving force \( f(t) \). This results in the differential equation:

\[ m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = f(t). \]

To simplify, the equation is divided by the mass \( m \), yielding a normalized form:

\[ \ddot{x} + 2\lambda \dot{x} + \omega^2 x = F(t), \]

where:
- \( 2\lambda = \frac{c}{m} \) represents the damping factor,
- \( \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \) is related to the system's natural frequency,
- \( F(t) = \frac{f(t)}{m} \) is the normalized external driving force.

The text sets up this framework for solving in a subsequent video, highlighting its simplicity.
