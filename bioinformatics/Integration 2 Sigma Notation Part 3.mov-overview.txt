The text describes a method to calculate the area under a curve by dividing it into an infinite number of rectangles, using concepts from calculus known as Riemann sums. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: The graph represents a function \( y = 1 - x^2 \), and we aim to find the area under this curve between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \).

2. **Rectangles**:
   - Divide the interval into \( n \) rectangles, where each has a width of \( \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n} = \frac{1-0}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \).
   - For right sums, the height of each rectangle is determined by evaluating the function at points \( f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \), where \( k \) ranges from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Sigma Notation**:
   - The area of each rectangle is \( f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \times \Delta x = f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \times \frac{1}{n} \).
   - Summing these areas gives the Riemann sum: 
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{n}
     \]
   - Substituting \( f(x) = 1 - x^2 \), we get:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 - \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2\right) \cdot \frac{1}{n}
     \]

4. **Simplification**:
   - Simplify the expression to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 - \frac{k^2}{n^2}\right)
     \]
   - This further simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 - \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2
     \]

5. **Limit**:
   - As \( n \) approaches infinity, calculate the limit of the sum to find the exact area.
   - Using known results for sums and limits, specifically the formula for the sum of squares, we find:
     \[
     \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{2}{6}\right) = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - Thus, the area under the curve \( y = 1 - x^2 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
