The text describes a method to calculate the area under a curve by dividing it into an infinite number of rectangles, using concepts from calculus known as Riemann sums. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: The graph represents a function \( y = 1 - x^2 \), and we aim to find the area under this curve between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \).

2. **Rectangles**:
   - Divide the interval into \( n \) rectangles, where each has a width of \( \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n} = \frac{1-0}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \).
   - For right sums, the height of each rectangle is determined by evaluating the function at points \( f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \), where \( k \) ranges from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Sigma Notation**:
   - The area of each rectangle is \( f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \times \Delta x = f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \times \frac{1}{n} \).
   - Summing these areas gives the Riemann sum: 
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{n}
     \]
   - Substituting \( f(x) = 1 - x^2 \), we get:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 - \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2\right) \cdot \frac{1}{n}
     \]

4. **Simplification**:
   - Simplify the expression to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 - \frac{k^2}{n^2}\right)
     \]
   - This further simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 - \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2
     \]

5. **Limit**:
   - As \( n \) approaches infinity, calculate the limit of the sum to find the exact area.
   - Using known results for sums and limits, specifically the formula for the sum of squares, we find:
     \[
     \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{2}{6}\right) = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - Thus, the area under the curve \( y = 1 - x^2 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The text describes a method to approximate the area under a curve using Riemann sums, specifically focusing on dividing the area into an infinite number of rectangles. The process involves:

1. **Dividing the Interval**: The interval \([a, b]\) is divided into \(n\) small rectangles, each with a width of \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\). For the example given, this becomes \(\Delta x = \frac{1-0}{n} = \frac{1}{n}\).

2. **Right and Lower Sums**: 
   - **Right Sums**: The height of each rectangle is determined by evaluating the function at the right endpoint of each subinterval.
   - **Lower Sums**: The height is determined by evaluating the function at the left endpoint.

3. **Sigma Notation**: The sum of the areas of these rectangles can be expressed in sigma notation, where \(k\) ranges from 1 to \(n\). For a function \(f(x) = 1 - x^2\), substituting \(x = \frac{k}{n}\) gives the height of each rectangle as \(f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)\).

4. **Simplification**: The expression for the sum is simplified using algebraic rules, leading to a formula involving the sum of squares.

5. **Taking the Limit**: To find the exact area under the curve, the limit of this sum as \(n\) approaches infinity is taken. This involves recognizing that terms with lower powers of \(n\) become negligible compared to the highest power.

6. **Result**: The final result after simplification and taking the limit is \(\frac{2}{3}\), which represents the true area under the curve from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\).

This method illustrates how integration can be approached by summing the areas of infinitesimally small rectangles, ultimately leading to the exact area as described by calculus.
