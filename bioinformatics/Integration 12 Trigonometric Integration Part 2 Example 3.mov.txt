You might have noticed that there is another way to tackle this problem that we've just looked at in the previous video, and that's by using another identity.
First of all, the powers of our trigonometric functions, sine squared, cosine squared, are both even, and that leaves us with a bit of a difficulty in that we need to use trigonometric substitutions using our trigonometric identities.
Now, there is one identity that we might not have looked at before, and remember that is sine of 2 times an angle equals 2 times the sine of that angle times the cosine of that angle.
Or, just algebraically manipulating this, we get that the sine of an angle times the cosine of an angle equals half times sine of 2 times that angle.
If we look at our problem here, we can rewrite it as the indefinite integral of the sine of the angle times the cosine of that angle squared with respect to that angle.
And here we have a substitution for that, and here we have a substitution for that.
We thus have the indefinite integral of a half times the sine of twice that angle, both of them, or all of that squared, with respect to that angle.
If we multiply it out, we get the indefinite integral of a quarter sine squared of a quarter sine squared of twice an angle with respect to that angle.
Now, we have yet another even power to our trigonometric function, and we have to use another trigonometric identity to get rid of that.
And how do we do that?
And how do we do that?
Well, we know that the sine squared of an angle equals 1 minus cosine of twice that angle divided by 2.
Still, again, don't get confused here.
We have twice the angle, sine squared of twice the angle, but the trigonometric identity we've just looked at as sine squared of once that angle.
All we're doing there is just changing the angle, multiplying it by 2 to get to where our problem was.
So all we need to do on the other side is just multiply our angle there by 2 as well.
Now, also, by the powers of integration, we can bring out the constant, which is a quarter.
And we have the indefinite integral of 1 minus cosine of 4 times that angle divided by 2, all with respect to that angle.
We can rewrite this still with a quarter, indefinite integral of a half, remember that sine to the power 0 minus a half, times cosine of 4 times that angle, all of that with respect to the angle.
Going on to the next page, we'll have a quarter, going on to the next page, going on to the next page, we'll have a quarter, now the indefinite integral of a half theta to the power 0 is going to be a half times theta, minus, now we can bring the half out, indefinite integral of the cosine of 4 times that angle, all still with respect to that angle.
Now, we've done one integration, now we've done one integration, now we've done one integration, now we've done one integration, it's indefinite, so remember to put a plus c.
Now, let's just look at the, let's just look at the, let's just look at this part, indefinite integral of cosine of 4 times an angle with respect to that angle.
We need to use u substitution, and we'll make u equals 4 times the angle, du d theta would thus be 4, and we have d theta equal to a quarter.
Now, now we can get rid of our problem, now we can get rid of our problem, now we can get rid of our theta in our problem, with our u substitution, we'll thus have a quarter times an angle minus an angle, and we'll have the cosine of u, and for d theta we'll have a quarter du plus c still, still indefinite integral.
Thus we'll have a quarter times a half of theta minus, we'll bring that out, that'll be an eighth, and the cosine of u, the indefinite integral of that, or the anti-derivative of that I should say, is the sine, u is 4 times theta,
and or we're also going to have plus c, this leaves us with an eighth of the angle minus 1 over 32 of sine, 4 times that angle, plus c, and that is exactly the answer we, we got by doing the original substitution in the previous video.
