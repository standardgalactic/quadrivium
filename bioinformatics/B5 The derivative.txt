We carry on with the derivatives, and I just wanted to remind you of a few special forms.
Here we have the f of x equals some constant to the power x,
so transcendental functions that we have here, not normal polynomials.
And the first derivative of this function would be a to the power x times the natural log of a.
We won't, as I say in the set of video lectures, we won't show how we derive these,
prove them in any way, we just have to remember them.
So if we have some growth of an organism that follows this kind of trend as far as its growth is concerned,
and we need to look at the rate of change of growth, that is how we would do that derivative.
e to the power x, such a special function, well as number to the power x exponent x,
that will just be itself.
The natural log of x, if we have logarithmic growth,
the first derivative of that, I remind you, is 1 over x.
For sine over x, we have the cosine of x.
For cosine of x, we have negative the sine of x.
And just as far, lastly, as the sum of the rules of derivatives are concerned,
if I have the addition or subtraction of two functions,
and I take the derivative of this, it is then just the derivative of this plus the derivative of that,
or the derivative of this minus the derivative of that,
depending on whether that was positive or negative.
So that's just one of the simple rules of the derivative.
