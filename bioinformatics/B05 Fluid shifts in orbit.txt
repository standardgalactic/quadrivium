Okay, so we talked about what happens when you go up, but what happens when the astronaut
comes down? Certainly in line with what we would expect. Definitely the preload goes
down as gravity pulls blood into this expanding volume that now exists, gets pulled down by
gravity, the preload goes down. As the preload goes down, there's obviously a decrease in
stroke of volume. So we're going to go back to about 70 or even less milliliters per beat
that gets ejected. To compensate and maintain an adequate cardiac output, you're going to increase
the heart rate. The blood pressure is certainly going to go down, especially when the astronaut
tries to get up, there's certainly going to be some orthostatic hypotension. Now the ADH will go up.
This time it's not only because of the stress, but also physiologically as we might as we might expect.
The body now realizes there is not enough fluid or plasma volume or water to go around and it wants
to conserve that. So this will go up until about three times increase. Renin activity will go up
up to about four times increase. We're going to get increased aldosterone levels because of that,
about 50% increase in those levels. And the atrial natriuretic peptide, that is going to decrease by
about a third. So all of these things are easy for us to explain. Certainly the fluid intake is going
to go up as we would expect. And the urinary output, well the urinary output is actually going to decrease
because of all of this, but it's decreased relative to what it was before the flight. It's certainly going
to be a bit more than it was during the flight when it is especially, when it is especially low. But certainly
the urinary output will decrease as compared to before, before launch under that 1G condition.
