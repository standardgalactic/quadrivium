experienced an event or were followed up for survival analysis, let's assign a random duration in months following a normal distribution. We will use `NORMINV` (or `NORM.INV` in some versions) to generate these values.

Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Mean and Standard Deviation**: Decide on the mean and standard deviation for the months. For instance, let's assume a mean of 12 months and a standard deviation of 6 months.

2. **Formula Setup**:
   - Use `NORMINV(RAND(), mean, std_dev)` to generate a normally distributed random number.
   - In this case: `=NORMINV(RAND(), 12, 6)`

3. **Implementation in Excel**:
   - Enter the formula into the first cell of your "months" column.
   - Double-click the small square (fill handle) at the bottom right corner of the selected cell to fill down the formula for all rows.

This setup will give you a column where each patient's duration in months follows a normal distribution with a mean of 12 and a standard deviation of 6. Adjust these parameters as needed to fit your specific scenario.

Here's a quick recap of the steps:

- **Select** the first cell in the "months" column.
- **Enter**: `=NORMINV(RAND(), 12, 6)`
- **Fill down** using the fill handle to apply this formula to all rows.

This will ensure that each patient has a randomly assigned duration in months following the specified normal distribution. Adjust the mean and standard deviation as necessary for your analysis.

The text outlines a method for creating simulated data using random number functions in spreadsheet software like Excel. Here are the main ideas:

1. **Simulating Data**: The author demonstrates how to create simulated data, focusing on generating values using uniform distributions with the `RANDBETWEEN` function. This simulates patient survival times ranging from 5 to 30 months.

2. **Completing Simulations**: By double-clicking, all cells in a column are filled down to row 250, efficiently populating data for multiple simulated patients.

3. **Stabilizing Random Data**: Each time the `F9` key is pressed, random values change. To fix these values and prevent them from changing, all selected random values (using SHIFT + COMMAND/CTRL + arrow keys) are copied and pasted as values rather than formulas. This action stabilizes the data.

4. **Data Types Included**: The simulated dataset includes various distributions such as chi-squared, normal, and uniform distributions, which can also be used for nominal categorical variables.

5. **Finalization and Usage**: After converting formulas to static values by deleting unnecessary cells, a complete and stable dataset is ready for import into analytical software for statistical analysis.
