The text provides a walkthrough for integrating \(\sin^3(x)\) with respect to \(x\) using trigonometric identities and substitution. The process begins by recognizing that the power of sine is odd, making it manageable. By expressing \(\sin^2(x)\) as \(1 - \cos^2(x)\), the integral \(\int \sin^3(x) \, dx\) becomes \(\int (1 - \cos^2(x))\sin(x) \, dx\). Using substitution with \(u = \cos(x)\), we find that \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\). This transforms the integral into \(-\int (1 - u^2) \, du\), which simplifies to \(u - \frac{1}{3}u^3 + C\). Replacing back with \(u = \cos(x)\), the final result is \(-\left(\frac{\cos^3(x)}{3} - \cos(x)\right) + C\) or equivalently, \(\frac{\cos^3(x)}{3} - \cos(x) + C\).

The text describes solving the indefinite integral of \(\sin^3(x)\) using trigonometric identities and substitution. Since the power of sine is odd, we can use the identity \(\sin^2(x) = 1 - \cos^2(x)\) to rewrite the integral as:

\[
\int \sin^2(x) \sin(x) \, dx = \int (1 - \cos^2(x)) \sin(x) \, dx
\]

Using \(u\)-substitution where \(u = \cos(x)\), we find that \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\). This transforms the integral into:

\[
-\int (1 - u^2) \, du
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-(\int 1 \, du - \int u^2 \, du) = -(u - \frac{1}{3}u^3) + C
\]

Substituting back \(u = \cos(x)\), the integral becomes:

\[
-\left(\cos(x) - \frac{1}{3}\cos^3(x)\right) + C = \frac{1}{3}\cos^3(x) - \cos(x) + C
\] 

This is the indefinite integral of \(\sin^3(x)\).
