The text discusses properties and operations involving the conjugate of complex numbers. Key points include:

1. **Properties of Conjugates**:
   - The conjugate of a sum: \((z_1 + z_2)^* = z_1^* + z_2^*\).
   - The conjugate of a product: \((z_1 \cdot z_2)^* = z_1^* \cdot z_2^*\).
   - The conjugate of a quotient (assuming the denominator is non-zero): \(\left(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right)^* = \frac{z_1^*}{z_2^*}\).
   - The double conjugate: \((z^*)^* = z\).

2. **Examples**:
   - Calculating \( \frac{1}{z} \) for various complex numbers by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
   - For \( z = i \), \( \frac{1}{i} = -i \).
   - For \( z = 1 - 5i \), \( \frac{1}{1-5i} = \frac{1}{26}(1 + 5i) = \frac{1}{26} + \frac{5}{26}i \).
   - For \( z = -\frac{1}{7}i \), \( \frac{1}{z} = 7i \).

3. **Dividing Complex Numbers**:
   - Example: Dividing \( i \) by \( 1 + i \) involves multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator, resulting in \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i \).
   - Another example is dividing complex expressions without expanding denominators directly, using conjugates to simplify.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Use conjugates to simplify division of complex numbers.
   - Avoid unnecessary expansion of denominators when possible by recognizing patterns or rewriting expressions.

The text emphasizes practical techniques for handling complex number operations, particularly focusing on the use of conjugates to facilitate division without extensive calculation.

The text describes the process of simplifying complex numbers by using their conjugates. Initially, it addresses a cumbersome expression: \(1 - \sqrt{3}\). By dealing with complex conjugates, the author aims to simplify the division of these complex expressions.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Simplification Strategy**: The text uses complex conjugates to divide complex numbers more easily. For example, dividing by \(1 + i\) involves multiplying by its conjugate \(1 - i\).

2. **Calculation Steps**:
   - Multiply \((1 + i)\) by its conjugate \((1 - i)\), resulting in a denominator of 2.
   - Similarly, for the expression involving \(\sqrt{3} + i\), multiply by its conjugate to simplify.

3. **Detailed Calculation**:
   - Simplifying \( (1+i)/(1-i) \) results in \((1+i)/2\).
   - For \((\sqrt{3}+i)(\sqrt{3}+i)\), the result is divided by 4, leading to \((1+\sqrt{3}i)/2\).

4. **Final Simplification**:
   - The author combines these results into a simpler form: \(\frac{1-\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{4}i\).
   - This approach avoids the complexity of directly multiplying the original expressions.

5. **Conclusion**: By using conjugates and grouping real and imaginary parts, the division of complex numbers becomes more manageable, making it easier to handle than direct multiplication.

The text provides an overview of properties and operations involving the conjugate of complex numbers. Here's a summary:

1. **Properties of Conjugates:**
   - The conjugate of a sum \((z_1 + z_2)\) is equal to the sum of the conjugates: \(\overline{z_1} + \overline{z_2}\).
   - Similarly, for products and division (assuming \(z_2 \neq 0\)): 
     - Conjugate of a product: \(\overline{(z_1 \cdot z_2)} = \overline{z_1} \cdot \overline{z_2}\).
     - Conjugate of a quotient: \(\overline{\left(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right)} = \frac{\overline{z_1}}{\overline{z_2}}\).
   - The conjugate of the conjugate returns the original number: \(\overline{\overline{z}} = z\).

2. **Examples:**
   - For division by complex numbers, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to simplify.
     - Example 1: \( \frac{i}{1+i} = i \cdot (1-i) / (1^2 + 1^2) = \frac{1+i}{2} \).
     - Example 2: \( \frac{\sqrt{3}+i}{\sqrt{3}-i} \) involves rewriting and simplifying using conjugates.
   - For expressions like \( \frac{1}{1-i} \), multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator simplifies the division.

The text emphasizes techniques for simplifying complex number divisions without calculators, suggesting strategic use of conjugates to avoid cumbersome calculations.

The text discusses simplifying expressions involving complex numbers by using the concept of complex conjugates. It starts with a scenario where dealing directly with \(\sqrt{3}\) in the power would be cumbersome. Instead, it proposes using complex conjugation to simplify the division of complex numbers.

1. The expression \(1 + i\) is derived from simplifying the denominator using its complex conjugate and then dividing by 2.
   
2. For \(\sqrt{3} + i\), the process involves multiplying it by its complex conjugate, resulting in an expression simplified to \((3 - 1) / (3 + 1)\).

3. Further simplification results in \((1 + \sqrt{3}i)/2\) and eventually leads to \(1/2 + (\sqrt{3}/2)i\).

4. The text then demonstrates multiplying two complex numbers, simplifying each step by breaking them into real and imaginary components.

5. Ultimately, it concludes with the product being expressed in a simpler form: \((1 - \sqrt{3})/4 + (1 + \sqrt{3})/4i\).

The overall approach emphasizes that using complex conjugates can significantly simplify operations involving complex numbers, making them easier to handle than performing direct multiplications.
