The text provides an explanation of how to determine the convergence or divergence of infinite series using the integral test, with a particular focus on \(p\)-series. Here's a summary:

1. **Series Basics**:
   - A series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) is composed of terms \(a_k\) summed from an initial index to infinity.
   - The partial sum, \(S_n\), represents the sum of the first \(n\) terms.
   - The remainder \(R_n\) is the sum of all subsequent terms beyond the nth term.

2. **Integral Test**:
   - This test compares a series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) with an improper integral \(\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx\), where \(f(k) = a_k\).
   - Conditions for the integral test include:
     - The function \(f(x)\) must be continuous, positive, and decreasing for all \(x \geq 1\).

3. **Application of Integral Test**:
   - If the improper integral converges (i.e., results in a finite value), then the series also converges.
   - Conversely, if the integral diverges, so does the series.

4. **\(p\)-Series Example**:
   - A \(p\)-series is expressed as \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^p}\).
   - It converges when \(p > 1\) and diverges for \(p \leq 1\). The harmonic series (\(p = 1\)) is a specific case that also diverges.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The integral test links the behavior of a series with an improper integral, making it easier to determine convergence or divergence.
   - By ensuring the function \(f(x)\) meets certain conditions, one can effectively use integrals to analyze and estimate the remainder (error) in truncated series.

Overall, the integral test is a useful tool for analyzing series by transforming the problem into one of evaluating improper integrals.
