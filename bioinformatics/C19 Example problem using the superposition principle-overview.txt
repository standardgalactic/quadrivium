The text describes solving a differential equation involving a complementary function derived from a characteristic equation, leading to complex roots. Here's a summary:

1. **Complementary Function**:  
   - Start with a homogeneous differential equation where \( g(x) = 0 \).
   - Solve the auxiliary equation: \( m^2 - m + 1 = 0 \), which results in complex conjugate roots.
   - The roots are \( m = \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \).
   - This leads to a complementary function:  
     \[
     y_c = e^{\frac{x}{2}}(c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x))
     \]

2. **Particular Solution**:  
   - The non-homogeneous term is \( g(x) = 2\sin(3x) \).
   - Assume a particular solution of the form:  
     \[
     y_p = a \cos(3x) + b \sin(3x)
     \]
   - Differentiate and substitute into the differential equation to find coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).

3. **Solving for Coefficients**:  
   - Set up equations by equating coefficients of \(\cos(3x)\) and \(\sin(3x)\).
   - Solve these equations to find:  
     \[
     a = \frac{6}{73}, \quad b = -\frac{16}{73}
     \]

4. **General Solution**:  
   - Combine the complementary and particular solutions:  
     \[
     y = e^{\frac{x}{2}}(c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x)) + \frac{6}{73} \cos(3x) - \frac{16}{73} \sin(3x)
     \]

The text emphasizes the importance of using both sine and cosine in the particular solution to account for derivatives properly.

The text describes setting an additional zero in a mathematical context, particularly involving the cosine function. This adjustment ensures that both terms are present on both sides of an equation, maintaining balance or equality within it. The focus seems to be on achieving symmetry or completeness in the equation by including this extra term.

The text provides a detailed explanation of solving a differential equation involving trigonometric functions, specifically focusing on finding a general solution. Here's a summary:

1. **Homogeneous Solution**: 
   - The problem involves an auxiliary (characteristic) equation: \( m^2 - m + 1 = 0 \).
   - Solving this yields complex roots: \( m = \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \).
   - This leads to a complementary solution, \( y_c(x) \), expressed as:
     \[
     y_c(x) = e^{\frac{1}{2}x} (c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x))
     \]

2. **Particular Solution**:
   - The non-homogeneous part involves \( g(x) = 2\sin(3x) \).
   - A trial solution for the particular part, \( y_p(x) \), is assumed to be of the form: 
     \[
     y_p(x) = a \cos(3x) + b \sin(3x)
     \]
   - Derivatives are calculated and substituted back into the differential equation.
   - Solving for coefficients, \( a \) and \( b \), results in:
     \[
     a = \frac{6}{73}, \quad b = -\frac{16}{73}
     \]

3. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution combines both the complementary and particular solutions:
     \[
     y(x) = e^{\frac{1}{2}x} (c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x)) + \frac{6}{73} \cos(3x) - \frac{16}{73} \sin(3x)
     \]

The text emphasizes using both sine and cosine in the particular solution to account for derivatives that swap between these functions.

The text discusses setting an additional zero in a mathematical context, specifically concerning the cosine function. This adjustment ensures that both terms involved are present on each side of the equation, likely for balancing or solving purposes.
