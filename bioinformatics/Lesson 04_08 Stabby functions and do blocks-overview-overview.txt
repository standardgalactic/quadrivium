The text introduces "stabby lambda functions" (lambda functions) in Ruby, which are anonymous functions defined using a concise syntax with the minus and greater than sign (e.g., `-x => 2*x**2 + 3*x - 2`). These functions are suitable for quick, inline operations due to their lack of names. They can be used with Ruby's `map` method to apply transformations across array elements.

For instance, a stabby lambda that applies the expression `2*x**2 + 3*x - 2` to each element in an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` demonstrates its utility. An alternative syntax using a block with `do` can achieve the same result.

The text provides further examples of more complex operations within these functions or blocks, such as conditionals (`if-else`). For example, an array `[3, 6, 9, 10, 11]` is processed to multiply each element by different factors based on its remainder when divided by 3: multiplying by 100 if the remainder is 0, by 200 for a remainder of 2, and by 300 for a remainder of 1.

Overall, stabby functions are highlighted as efficient tools for array processing with mathematical operations in Ruby. The text suggests that future sections will explore more advanced uses, such as passing functions as arguments.
