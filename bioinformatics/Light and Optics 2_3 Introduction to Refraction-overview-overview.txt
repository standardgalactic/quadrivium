The text outlines a physics problem involving refraction, Snell's Law, and angle of deviation as light passes through a medium with different refractive indices.

### Key Concepts
1. **Refraction**: Light bends when transitioning between media due to speed changes.
2. **Snell's Law**: Relates the angles of incidence (\(\theta_i\)) and refraction (\(\theta_t\)) to their respective mediaâ€™s refractive indices:
   \[
   n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \sin(\theta_t)
   \]
3. **Angle of Deviation**: The angle between incoming and outgoing light rays after passing through a prism.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Light enters perpendicularly, eliminating initial refraction.
   - Refractive indices: \( n_i = 1.55 \) (outside), \( n_t = 1 \) (inside).

2. **Geometry and Angles**:
   - Incident angle inside the prism is 30 degrees.
   - Refracted angle (\(\theta_t\)) relationship: \(\theta_t = D + \theta_i\).
   - Internal angles are determined using triangle geometry.

3. **Applying Snell's Law**:
   - At refraction interface:
     \[
     1.55 \times \sin(30^\circ) = \sin(\theta_t)
     \]
   - With \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\), calculate:
     \[
     \sin(\theta_t) = 0.775
     \]

4. **Solving for the Angle of Deviation**:
   - Find \(\theta_t\) using inverse sine:
     \[
     \theta_t = \arcsin(0.775)
     \]
   - Calculate deviation \( D \):
     \[
     D + 30^\circ = \theta_t
     \]
     \[
     D = \theta_t - 30^\circ
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Compute \(\theta_t \approx 50.8^\circ\).
   - Deviation \( D \) is:
     \[
     D = 50.8^\circ - 30^\circ = 20.8^\circ
     \]

### Conclusion
The angle of deviation \( D \) for the light ray through the prism is approximately \( 20.8^\circ \). This involves understanding refraction, applying Snell's Law, and using geometric relationships to determine unknown angles.
