The text introduces biomathematics, emphasizing the importance of understanding graphs as visual representations of mathematical functions within this field. Graphs are plotted on Cartesian coordinate systems, illustrating values from experiments or equations with x and y-axes. 

Desmos, an online graphing calculator accessible at www.desmos.com via web browsers, is highlighted as a key learning tool for plotting functions and exploring concepts like slopes (m) and y-intercepts (c). Users can input equations such as \(y = mx + c\) to see how changes in slope and intercept affect the graph, aiding in understanding basic linear functions crucial for modeling biological phenomena.

The text details Desmos features, including adding points, zooming, changing coordinates, and switching between degrees or radians. These functionalities enhance its versatility for visual experimentation on the Cartesian plane. The aim is to familiarize users with essential graph aspects through practical application using Desmos in biomathematics.
