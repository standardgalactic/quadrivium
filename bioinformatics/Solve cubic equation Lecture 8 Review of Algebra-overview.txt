It looks like you're working on solving cubic equations using various methods such as factoring and the Rational Root Theorem. Let's summarize the approaches you mentioned:

### Solving Cubic Equations

#### 1. **Factoring by Grouping:**

For a cubic equation of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \), if it can be factored into groups, this method is useful.

**Example:** 
\[ x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0 \]

- **Group terms**: \( (x^3 + x^2) + (-4x - 4) = 0 \)
- **Factor each group**: 
  - From the first group, factor out \( x^2 \): \( x^2(x + 1) \)
  - From the second group, factor out \(-4\): \(-4(x + 1)\)

- **Factor by grouping**: 
  - Now you have: \( x^2(x + 1) - 4(x + 1) = 0 \)
  - Factor out the common term \((x + 1)\): \( (x + 1)(x^2 - 4) = 0 \)

- **Solve for roots**: 
  - \( x + 1 = 0 \) gives \( x = -1 \)
  - \( x^2 - 4 = 0 \) gives \( x = \pm 2 \)

#### 2. **Rational Root Theorem:**

This theorem helps identify possible rational roots of a polynomial equation.

- **Identify factors**: 
  - For the constant term \( d = -4 \), the factors are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4 \).
  - For the leading coefficient \( a = 1 \), the factors are \( \pm 1 \).

- **Possible rational roots**: 
  - Combine these to get possible roots: \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4 \).

- **Test each root** by substituting into the original equation to see if it results in zero.

### Example Verification

For the equation \( x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0 \), you found roots \( x = -1, 2, -2 \). You can verify these by substitution:

- **Substitute \( x = -1 \)**:
  \[
  (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 4 = -1 + 1 + 4 - 4 = 0
  \]

- **Substitute \( x = 2 \)**:
  \[
  (2)^3 + (2)^2 - 4(2) - 4 = 8 + 4 - 8 - 4 = 0
  \]

- **Substitute \( x = -2 \)**:
  \[
  (-2)^3 + (-2)^2 - 4(-2) - 4 = -8 + 4 + 8 - 4 = 0
  \]

Each substitution confirms the roots are correct. These methods provide a structured way to solve cubic equations, either by factoring or testing possible rational roots.

The text explains a method for finding factors and roots of cubic polynomial equations using potential rational roots derived from the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem suggests that possible rational roots of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients can be found by taking the ratio of factors of the constant term (d) to factors of the leading coefficient (a).

For example, consider the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0 \). The potential factors based on the Rational Root Theorem are determined from ±1 and ±4. By testing these values using synthetic or long division, it is found that \( x + 1 \) is a factor because dividing by it leaves no remainder. This leads to simplifying the polynomial to \( (x+1)(x^2 - 4) = 0 \), which can be further factored and solved to find roots: \( x = -1, 2, -2 \).

The text also describes applying this method to another polynomial, \( 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 11x - 6 = 0 \). Here, potential factors are derived from ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6 divided by the leading coefficient ±2, yielding possible roots: \( x = \pm1, \pm\frac{1}{2}, \pm2, \pm3, \pm\frac{3}{2}, \pm6 \). Each candidate must be tested individually to determine which are actual roots.

In summary, the Rational Root Theorem provides a systematic way to identify potential rational solutions for polynomial equations, especially useful for cubic and quartic polynomials. However, no such simple formulas exist for higher-degree polynomials (fifth degree or above) due to their complexity.
