Lastly, let's quickly discuss gamma decay.
So what comes off is actually a gamma photon or photon
in the gamma ray
end of the spectrum. So very high frequency, small
wavelength photon. And as we showed before,
it goes through more than 10 centimeters of lead. There's no transmutation
that takes place. So what happens
is the change in energy level in the nucleus. Just as the electrons
can only be in discrete orbits with discrete
energy levels, so can the nucleons in the nucleus. The nucleus can
also just jump between discrete energy
levels. And if you fall from a higher energy to a lower energy
state in the nucleus, that is denoted by the parent being
an asterisk. So that gives you the daughter. On that side,
no change in the atomic number, no change in the atomic mass number.
So there will just be a gamma photon
that comes off. So again, indeed
no transmutation.
So calculate the wavelength
of a gamma ray photon
emitted by radium
236 with
0.186 mega electron
volt energy.
It's very simple.
We know that energy equals
HF because we are talking about
gamma rays. In other words, C equals
diff lambda. In other words, E equals, we've seen this a hundred times
before, lambda.
I can solve for lambda. The only thing
that I need to do, don't make a silly mistake,
please convert this into
kilojoules.
And that gives me a
wavelength of
6.68
picometres.
Much less than the nanometre lengths
we've been dealing with thus far with the electron
as far as
those were
in the range of nanometres
ultraviolet and visual
spectrum. So this is a much
tinier wavelength. Much higher
frequency. 6.68
times 10 to the power
negative 12 meters.
Good. Let's look at this
problem.
I want the daughter product
of
polonium 216
undergoing first alpha decay
and then that daughter product through that alpha
decay undergoes beta negative decay.
So let's just remind
ourselves what this is.
This is going to be parent
ZA.
That is going to give us some daughter
and it's alpha decay, remember
so that is going to be helium
to 4. And that means
I've got to have a Z minus
2 and I've got to have an A minus
4.
So from polonium, what are we
going to get? We're going to get
some daughter product.
It's called a daughter product 1
which is going to be
84 minus 2 is 82.
216 minus
4 is 212
plus then
that helium.
Now this is my new
payment and it undergoes beta decay
and let's remind ourselves of beta
negative decay
that we start with Z and A
that is going to give us some daughter product
and that daughter product
is going to be plus an electron
negative 1.
So this is going to be Z plus 1
and that just remains A.
So if this new pair is now
and it goes beta negative decay
we're going to have a new daughter
let's call that daughter 2
so 81 has to go to 83
and 212 stays the same
and that indeed
if you look that up on the table
that is bismuth
bismuth 83
bismuth 212
so that was easy enough
for decay
the daughter nucleus
must be more stable
in other words have a lower energy
have a lower energy state
or the energy is released
remember when we wrote it like this
we said plus energy
plus energy
it is not the binding energy on the other side
this is not what we're dealing with here
so certainly this for this alpha beta negative
and gamma decay this state involves
now
is this possible for
we have this proton emission
over here
we have uranium 235
so this is a hypothetical type of decay
I want to know in nature is this possible
I'm talking
I'm not putting any energy into the system
what happens is
that nucleus is unstable
and it will emit a certain array
and therefore become more stable
so I have uranium 238
there's its atomic mass number
I have protactinium 237
and I have my proton there
these are my atomic mass numbers
and I can convert atomic mass numbers
to energy by multiplying by
931.5 mega electron volts per unit
and if you add these two
let me see that these two
are more than this
so there's an increase in energy
there's no energy release
so this is an impossible
type of decay
cannot happen in nature
in this problem
we have polonium 210
and it undergoes alpha decay
to lead 206
so I suggest that all the energy
goes into the much much lighter
alpha particle
into its kinetic energy
because it's so much lighter
let's just imagine that this heavy lead
just stays where it is
and all the kinetic energy goes in
all the least energy goes into
kinetic energy of the alpha particle
calculates its speed
so what we're going to have
with alpha
so we're going to have the polonium
84-210
that is going to go to lead
lead 206
which gives us the 82 there
plus we know this 4-2 helium
and we know that we can pack all these units together
and these units together
and these units together
in as much as contains the electrons
and it's going to be plus energy
so it's very good that my energy
is just going to be
this atomic
mass units
minus the combination
of these two atomic mass units
I've cleared all the electrons
and that will leave me with
I think my answer was
5.805
times 10 to the power
negative 3 units
the recording stopped there
when it was to me
so I think I left off by saying
does this energy subtract that from this
as far as the atomic mass units are concerned
I can convert that to electron bulb
and I also know that
1.6022
times 10 to the power
of negative 20 joules
goes into one electron volt
I just might need to remember
that that is times
10 to the power 6
I've got kinetic energy
if I don't include relativistic
conservations
equaling to half the unit squared
then we mean velocity
equals the square root of
2 times the kinetic energy
divided by mass
if I do all of this conversion
I will get kinetic energy
because I said all of that
energy is going to go into kinetic energy
that leaves me 8.662
2 times 10 to the power
negative
I think it was 13 joule
now I just need mass
I just need mass
and because I think all of this
does include the electrons
I just need to work out the mass for this
and I know one unit
equals 1.6055
times 10 to the power
negative 27 kilograms
so if I multiply that by
I've got 4.002603 units
that is going to give me the kilograms
with this I get rid of the electrons
just of that alpha particle
which gives me
you know the square root of
2 times that
8.66
6.66
2 times 10 to the power
negative 13 joules
and I'm going to divide that by the mass
as I said
and if I multiply those
I get a mass of 6.6463
6.463
6.463
that was 10 to the power
negative 27 kilograms
yes
and indeed
if I do that
I get the value for
my speed
you know
calculus
you get right about
the same thing
1.61 times 10 to the power
7 meters per second
meters per second
