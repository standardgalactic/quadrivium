In the first two videos in this series, I took a look at some basic statistical definitions
and ways in which to chart data.
In this video, I finally start with some mathematics, by looking at measures of central tendency.
A measure of central tendency replaces a set of data values with a single number.
There are three ways to measure central tendency, and that is the mean or average, median and
intuitive mode.
Before I get to this though, I need to explain a Greek symbol, called the sum of symbol, used
in sigma notation.
For those of you unfamiliar with it, I'll take a minute or two to explain it.
Here's a simple arithmetic sum.
It states that 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 plus 8 plus 9 plus 10 plus 11
plus 12 plus 13 plus 14 plus 15 plus 16 plus 17 equals 153.
Instead of writing this long sum, I can write the following.
It reads, the sum of all i's from i equals 1 to i equals 17 equals 153.
The values of i start at 1 and increments by 1 until I reach 17.
Now back to the first measure of central tendency, the mean.
It is simply the average of the data values.
Add all the values and divide by the number of values.
Using the same values as in our sum above, we'll leave 153 divided by 17 and that equals 9.
Mathematically, this is represented by this expression.
The x with a bar on top is called the sample mean or average.
The x i represents each of the values, so x1 will be 1, x2 will be 2 and so on.
Since there are 17 values, I divide by 17.
A more generic way of writing the mean sum is the following expression, where n is the
number of data values.
Note that the last two sum expressions are not purely mathematical.
Notice the x i values represent data values, with the increment just jumping from one value
to the next value in the set.
Thinking back to video 2, each value will be the number of patients seen each month.
The first sum of expression I showed above is a real mathematical expression, as i represents
a real number that gets incremented by 1 each time.
If you are interested in mathematics, take a moment to think about this difference.
Otherwise just ignore it.
The next concept I need to discuss is the weighted mean.
In the examples above, each data value is given equal weight.
There were 17 values and each one is as significant as the next.
What though if I want to give some values more weight than others?
For this example, I will stray from a medical example and look at student exam results.
Say a student writes two tests during the year and a final exam at the end of the year.
Test 1 counts for 15% of the total year mark, test 2 35% and the final exam counts for 50%.
If a given student gets 70%, 65% and 81%, the mean will be 70 plus 65 plus 81 divided by 3.
On the parlance of our sigma notation where x1 is 70, x2 is 65 and x3 is 81 and n equals 3,
the mean will be 216 divided by 3 which is 72%.
Using the weighted average though, I will use this notation.
Now this looks a lot worse than it really is.
Wi is the weight value for each data value.
So for value x1 which is 70, the weight is 15 and for x2 which is 65, the w2 value is 35.
And for the x3 value which is 81, the w3 value is 50.
The denominator, that is the part under the dividing line, simply adds the weight values
and in this case it adds up to 100.
Here is the final equation.
This differs from the 72% which was the mean.
The next measure of central tendency is the median.
It represents the value in the data set for which half of the values are less than and
the other half is more than the median.
If my data set is 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 35, 37 and 41, the mean would be 20.
As there are 4 values lower than 20 and 4 values greater than 20.
In this example, there is an odd number of values, namely 9.
If the data set contains an even number of data values, the average or mean of the median
2 values greater than 2 values are taken.
So adding a 19 to the set above, the median would be 19 plus 20 divided by 2 which is 19.5.
I would still say that there are 4 values less than the median and 4 values more than the median
because both 19 and 20 are encompassed in the median.
The last measure of central tendency is the mode.
It represents the data value that appears most in a set.
If the data set is 12, 14, 17, 17, 17, 18, 18, 20, 22, 22, 23, the mode is 17 as it appears
most often.
Now that's it for this video.
In the next video I will take a look at measures of dispersion.
This evaluates how far individual data values stray from the mean.
