This tutorial introduces the Keras package in R, targeting healthcare professionals interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, particularly deep neural networks. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding AI for modern research, urging medical personnel to gain skills in both computer science and healthcare.

The tutorial utilizes an R Markdown file hosted on the author's rpubs page, focusing primarily on the code cells. It begins by setting up the working directory and importing necessary packages such as Keras. The tutorial provides a link to keras.rstudio.com for further installation details.

A dataset from the University of California at Irvine, specifically the tocogram data set for fetal cardiac monitoring, is used as an example. This dataset contains 2,126 samples with 21 features and one target variable, which has three classes: normal, suspect, or pathologic. The author has pre-cleaned this dataset and made it available on their GitHub repository.

The tutorial demonstrates a basic neural network model using Keras in R with TensorFlow as the backend, achieving about 88% accuracy. It highlights the ease of coding in R Studio compared to Python for similar tasks.

Key steps covered include:
- Reading the CSV file into an R data frame and converting it to a matrix.
- Adjusting target variable classes (1, 2, 3) to (0, 1, 2) using broadcasting for one-hot encoding preparation.
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets with a 70%-30% ratio using the sample function in R.
- Preparing feature matrices (X_train, X_test) and target vectors (Y_train, Y_test) with one-hot encoding via Keras's `to_categorical` function.

The tutorial concludes by mentioning the use of a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance. Overall, it advocates for medical researchers to learn data science tools like R Studio and Keras to enhance their research capabilities in AI applications.

The text outlines steps for creating and evaluating a multilayer neural network model using Keras. Here's a summary:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The target variable is located in column 22 of the dataset.
   - One-hot encoding is applied to transform categorical variables into a matrix format, representing each category as a binary vector.

2. **Normalization:**
   - Both training and test datasets are normalized using the mean and standard deviation calculated from the training set only, avoiding data leakage.

3. **Model Creation:**
   - A sequential neural network model is built using Keras.
   - The first layer includes 22 units with L2 regularization (0.001) and a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting.
   - Subsequent layers include additional dense layers, also employing dropout and ReLU activations.
   - The final layer uses a softmax activation for classification into three classes.

4. **Model Compilation:**
   - The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, 'adam' optimizer, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

5. **Training:**
   - The model is trained on the dataset using 20 epochs and a mini-batch size of 64.
   - A validation split of 20% is used to monitor overfitting during training.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - After training, the model's performance is evaluated on unseen test data, achieving an accuracy of approximately 89%.
   - A confusion matrix is generated to further assess the model's predictions against actual values.

The process highlights best practices in machine learning, such as proper normalization and regularization techniques, while also showcasing Keras' capabilities for building neural networks.

The text discusses evaluating model performance by comparing predicted values against actual values, using accuracy visualizations where errors appear off the main diagonal. It also introduces using probability predictions with a method called `predict_prob` in R-Studio, specifically for X-test data. This is implemented using column binding (`cbind`) to combine results into a computer variable named `prob`. The example provided shows a sample prediction with a high probability of 0.9966 for the class "zero," which matches the actual value.

The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of learning machine learning and deep learning, particularly in healthcare research. It recommends using R-Studio with Keras and TensorFlow as an effective toolset for these tasks. The overall message encourages professionals to engage with these technologies for better insights and advancements in their field.
