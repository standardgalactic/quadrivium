The text explains the concept of an "inverse element" within sets and binary operations:

1. **Set and Binary Operation**: A set contains elements that can be combined using a defined binary operation, such as multiplication.

2. **Identity Element**: An identity element \( u \) exists in the set so that any element \( x \) combined with \( u \) under the binary operation remains \( x \).

3. **Inverse Element Definition**: For an element \( x_1 \), its inverse \( x_2 \) is such that combining them using the binary operation results in the identity element \( u \). Mathematically, this means \( x_1 \) operated with \( x_2 \) equals \( u \).

4. **Example**: In the set of rational numbers with multiplication as the operation:
   - If \( x_1 = 3 \), then its inverse \( x_2 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) because \( 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \).
   - Here, 1 serves as the identity element under multiplication.

This provides a basic understanding of inverse elements in algebraic contexts.
