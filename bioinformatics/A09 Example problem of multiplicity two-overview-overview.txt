The text provides a method for solving differential equations involving matrices with repeated eigenvalues, specifically focusing on an eigenvalue of multiplicity 2. Hereâ€™s a concise summary:

1. **Definition and Setup**: The text defines eigenvalue multiplicity and sets up the problem for finding eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation of a matrix \(\mathbf{A} - \lambda\mathbf{I}\).

2. **Example Matrix**: Given the 2x2 matrix 

   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   3 & -18 \\
   2 & -9
   \end{bmatrix},
   \]

   the characteristic polynomial is determined to be \(\lambda^2 + 6\lambda + 9 = 0\), which factors into \((\lambda + 3)^2 = 0\). This reveals a repeated eigenvalue of \(-3\) with multiplicity 2.

3. **Finding Eigenvectors**: For the eigenvalue \(-3\), solving

   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   6 & -18 \\
   2 & -6
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   k_1 \\
   k_2
   \end{bmatrix} = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\
   0
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

   results in an eigenvector \(\mathbf{k} = [3, 1]\).

4. **Generalized Eigenvector**: Since only one linearly independent eigenvector is found for a multiplicity of 2, the generalized eigenvector method is used. Solving 

   \[
   (\mathbf{A} + 3\mathbf{I})\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{k}
   \]

   yields a generalized eigenvector \(\mathbf{p} = [0.5, 0]\).

5. **General Solution**: The solution to the system is expressed as:

   \[
   \mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   3 \\
   1
   \end{bmatrix} e^{-3t} + c_2 \left( t 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   3 \\
   1
   \end{bmatrix} + 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0.5 \\
   0
   \end{bmatrix} \right) e^{-3t},
   \]

   where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants determined by initial conditions, incorporating both the eigenvector and generalized eigenvector contributions due to the repeated eigenvalue.
