The text explains how to verify that the inverse of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix \(A\) is correct by confirming that multiplying \(A\) by its inverse results in the identity matrix. This verification is done in two steps: first by multiplying \(A\) by its inverse, and then by reversing the order to multiply the inverse by \(A\). In both cases, the resulting product matrices are confirmed to be the identity matrix. The process involves using the specific formula for calculating the inverse of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix and checking each element in the resultant matrices to ensure they match the identity matrix elements. This exercise demonstrates that multiplying a matrix by its inverse indeed yields an identity matrix, thereby verifying the correctness of the matrix inversion concept.
