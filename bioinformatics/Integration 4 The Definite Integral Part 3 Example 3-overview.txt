The text explains how to calculate the total area between the sine curve \( y = \sin(x) \) and the x-axis over the interval from 0 to \( 2\pi \). Unlike a regular definite integral, which considers areas below the x-axis as negative (thus cancelling out positive areas), this calculation requires taking the absolute value of areas below the x-axis.

The sine curve has two equal areas in this interval: one positive from 0 to \( \pi \) and one negative from \( \pi \) to \( 2\pi \). The integral from 0 to \( \pi \) is calculated as follows:

1. Integrate \( \sin(x) \) from 0 to \( \pi \), resulting in:
   - Antiderivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
   - Evaluate: \(-\cos(\pi) - (-\cos(0)) = 1 + 1 = 2\)

For the interval from \( \pi \) to \( 2\pi \):

2. Integrate \( \sin(x) \) from \( \pi \) to \( 2\pi \), resulting in:
   - Antiderivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
   - Evaluate: \(-(\cos(2\pi) - \cos(\pi)) = -(1 + 1) = -2\)

Since the area must be positive, take the absolute value of \(-2\), which is \(2\).

Adding these areas together gives a total area of \(2 + 2 = 4\) square units between the curve and the x-axis over the interval from 0 to \(2\pi\).
