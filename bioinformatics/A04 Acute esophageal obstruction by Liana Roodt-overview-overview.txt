The text provides an overview of managing acute esophageal obstruction, with a particular focus on foreign body ingestion in children. Key points include:

1. **Acute Esophageal Obstruction**:
   - Defined as a sudden blockage in the esophagus preventing fluid and solid movement.
   - Causes complications like aspiration, perforation, and bleeding but focuses here on management.

2. **Common Causes in Children**:
   - Foreign bodies (e.g., coins, toys), with batteries posing significant risks due to their caustic nature.
   - Batteries larger than 15 mm can cause severe injuries like esophageal burns or fistulas.

3. **Diagnostic and Management Approaches**:
   - Use of x-rays and contrast studies for diagnosis.
   - Emergency endoscopy recommended, especially for batteries.

4. **Endoscopic Removal**:
   - Primary method for foreign body removal; considered safe and effective.
   - Alternative methods include creating mucosal breaches or esophageal dilatation in specific cases (e.g., sharp objects).

5. **Management of Achalasia**:
   - Characterized by LES issues leading to obstruction.
   - Treatment strategies include medical management, endoscopic treatments like botulinum toxin injections and pneumatic dilation, and surgical options such as laparoscopic Heller myotomy.

6. **Stenting for Esophageal Obstruction**:
   - Used particularly in cases of tumor-related obstructions or refractory dysphagia.
   - Self-expanding metal stents are preferred due to their lower migration risk compared to plastic stents, though both have specific applications and benefits.

The text emphasizes the importance of tailored management strategies based on patient-specific factors and underlying conditions.
