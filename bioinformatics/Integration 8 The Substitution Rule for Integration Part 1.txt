Now that we are familiar with the product rule of integration, let us consider using substitution to solve some indefinite integral problems.
We will tackle this by looking at some examples.
Here's the first one.
We are asked to calculate the indefinite integral of the product of the square root of 1 plus x squared and 2x with respect to x.
We could consider the product rule as we have the product of two functions here.
What we must look out for though, is if a derivative of any part of one function appears in the other.
And here we have x squared and its first derivative is 2x.
This is the clue we need to use the substitution rule.
Consider letting u equal 1 plus x squared.
u' would then be du dx equals 2x.
And simplifying would leave du equals 2x dx.
Rewriting our original problem now looks like this.
Substituting 2x dx for du leaves a simple expression for which we can calculate the indefinite integral with ease.
that is 2 over 3 u to the power 3 over 2 plus c.
Substituting our original u value leaves us with the answer to the problem.
2 thirds times 1 plus x squared to the power 3 over 2 plus c.
