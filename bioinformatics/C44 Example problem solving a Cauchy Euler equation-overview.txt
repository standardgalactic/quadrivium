The text outlines solving a differential equation involving the fourth derivative of \( y \) with a non-constant coefficient. The author decides to use substitution by letting \( p = y''' \), which transforms the problem into one resembling a Cauchy-Euler (or Euler-Cauchy) equation: 

\[ x p' + 6p = 0 \]

This is simplified by substituting \( p = c_1 x^{m-6} \). Solving for \( m \) results in \( m = -6 \), leading to:

\[ y''' = c_1 x^{-6} \]

The author then integrates this expression step-by-step to find the original function \( y(x) \):

1. Integrate \( y''' \) to get \( y'' \):
   \[
   y'' = \frac{c_1}{-5} x^{-5} + c_2
   \]

2. Integrate \( y'' \) to find \( y' \):
   \[
   y' = \frac{c_1}{-4} x^{-4} + c_2x + c_3
   \]

3. Finally, integrate \( y' \) to determine \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{c_1}{-3} x^{-3} + \frac{c_2}{2} x^2 + c_3x + c_4
   \]

Throughout the process, integration constants (\( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 \)) are introduced at each step. The text emphasizes that these constants remain arbitrary since each constant divided by another constant still results in a new constant. This approach effectively demonstrates solving higher-order differential equations using substitution and integration techniques.

The text discusses solving a fourth-order differential equation where \( y^{(4)} \) involves a non-constant coefficient. The standard solution form \( y = x^m \) cannot be used due to the nature of the coefficients. Instead, the author introduces a substitution \( p = y''' \), transforming the original equation into a Cauchy-Euler (or Euler-Cauchy) equation: \( xp' + 6p = 0 \).

This transformation leads to solving for \( p \) as a function of \( x \). The solution involves finding that \( m = -6 \), so \( y''' = c_1 x^{-6} \). Integrating this expression three times results in the general solution for \( y \):

1. Integrate \( y''' = c_1 x^{-6} \) to find \( y'' = \frac{c_1}{-5}x^{-5} + C_2 \).
2. Integrate \( y'' \) to get \( y' = \frac{c_1}{-4}x^{-4} + C_2x + C_3 \).
3. Finally, integrate \( y' \) to obtain \( y = \frac{c_1}{-3}x^{-3} + \frac{C_2}{2}x^2 + C_3x + C_4 \).

The constants \( c_1, C_2, C_3, \) and \( C_4 \) are arbitrary due to the indefinite integrals. The process highlights how each integration step introduces a new constant, illustrating the backward integration from the third derivative back to the original function.
