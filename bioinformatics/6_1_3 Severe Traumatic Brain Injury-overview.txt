The text discusses various modalities for managing elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Mannitol**:
   - Administered as 0.25-1 g/kg body weight, mannitol is often used first-line due to its osmotic diuretic effect.
   - It decreases brain edema by drawing water out and reducing intravascular volume, peaking in effectiveness within 30-60 minutes and lasting up to 6 hours.
   - Bolus dosing may be more effective than continuous infusion.
   - Furosemide should not be combined with mannitol due to risks of rapid diuresis and electrolyte disturbances.
   - Serum osmolality should remain below 320 mOsm/L to avoid renal injury, and urine output must be monitored.

2. **Hyperventilation**:
   - Increases minute ventilation (tidal volume x respiratory rate), reducing PaCO2 and causing cerebral vasoconstriction, which can lower ICP temporarily.
   - Should only be used briefly in cases where other treatments have failed, specifically for persistent ICPs over 25 mm Hg.
   - Aims to maintain normocapnia (PaCO2 levels of 25-30 mm Hg) and is not recommended as a first-line treatment.

3. **Hypertonic Saline**:
   - Used secondarily when mannitol loses effectiveness; it acutely decreases ICP.
   - Administered in concentrations up to 23.4% for boluses or 1.83% continuously.
   - Can be beneficial for patients with metabolic acidosis if sodium acetate is used instead of chloride, preventing worsening of the condition.
   - Requires careful monitoring due to risks of hyperosmolality and acute kidney injury.

4. **Glucocorticoids**:
   - May reduce edema around brain tumors but are not recommended for managing raised ICP in other conditions.
   - Studies show increased rates of severe disability and death, highlighting their unsuitability for this purpose. 

Overall, these modalities offer a range of options tailored to specific patient needs and clinical scenarios when managing intracranial pressure.
