The text describes how to calculate the energy released from the alpha decay of radium-224 over its half-life of 3.66 days and use this energy to melt ice. Here's a summary:

1. **Decay Process:** Radium-224 decays into radon-220, releasing energy.

2. **Energy Calculation:** 
   - Calculate the energy per decay by finding the mass defect in atomic mass units (amu) and converting it to joules.
   
3. **Amount of Radium:** Start with 1 gram of radium-224, containing about \(2.69 \times 10^{21}\) atoms.

4. **Decay Over Time:**
   - Use the half-life formula to find how many nuclei remain after 3.66 days.
   - Calculate the decay constant (\(\lambda\)) using \(\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{\text{half-life}}\).
   - Determine the number of atoms that have decayed.

5. **Total Energy Released:** 
   - Multiply the energy per decay by the number of decays to get total energy released.

6. **Melting Ice:**
   - Use the latent heat of fusion for ice (33.5 J/g) to find how much ice can be melted with this energy.

7. **Result:** Approximately 3,710 kilograms of ice can be melted by the energy from one gram of radium-224 over its half-life period. This illustrates the substantial energy involved in nuclear processes even on a small scale.
