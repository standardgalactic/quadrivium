The text provides an in-depth exploration of the concept of cosets within group theory. It explains that if \( H \) is a subgroup of a larger group \( G \), and \( A \) is an element of \( G \), then \( AH \) represents a left coset, while \( HA \) denotes a right coset.

Using Cayley's tables—a tool to visualize operations within groups—the text illustrates how these cosets behave. It discusses two scenarios: when \( A \) is not an element of \( H \) and when it is. If \( A \) is in \( H \), it will naturally belong to both the left and right cosets, as these include all possible combinations under group operations including the identity element.

When \( A \) is not in \( H \), the text explains that the intersections of the coset with \( H \) are empty. This is shown using a proof by contradiction: assuming the intersection isn't empty leads to showing \( A \) must belong to \( H \), contradicting the initial assumption.

Overall, the explanation utilizes Cayley's theorem and tables to provide insights into how elements in a group form cosets relative to a subgroup, highlighting the structure and behavior of groups through visual and logical reasoning.
