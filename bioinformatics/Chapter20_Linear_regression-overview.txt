The text introduces linear regression as a method to analyze the correlation between two sets of numerical values. While mentioning other statistical techniques like t-tests and chi-squared tests, it emphasizes that linear regression is particularly useful for exploring relationships between variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. This technique helps in understanding how one variable affects another within a dataset. The text encourages readers to explore more about this method.

The text introduces statistical methods for analyzing relationships and differences in data. It mentions that while t-tests are used to compare means and chi-squared tests are used for categorical data analysis, there is another method called linear regression for examining the correlation between two sets of numerical values. Linear regression helps determine the strength and direction of a relationship between variables. The text suggests exploring this method further.
