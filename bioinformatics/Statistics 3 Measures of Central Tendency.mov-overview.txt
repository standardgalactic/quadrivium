The text provides an overview of three primary measures of central tendency: the mean, median, and mode. It begins with an explanation of sigma notation, a Greek symbol representing summation, which simplifies lengthy arithmetic expressions into more concise forms. The discussion then moves to the mean (or average), described as the sum of all data values divided by the number of values. An example using 17 consecutive numbers demonstrates how the sample mean is calculated.

The concept of weighted mean is introduced for situations where certain data points need to be given more significance than others, such as assigning different weights to test scores in calculating a student's final grade. The text provides an example involving three tests with varying weight percentages and shows how the weighted mean differs from the arithmetic mean.

Next, it explains the median, defined as the middle value of a data set that divides it into two equal halves. Examples are given for both odd and even-numbered datasets to illustrate how the median is determined when there's an even number of values by averaging the two central numbers.

The mode is described as the most frequently occurring value in a dataset, with examples provided to highlight its identification. The text concludes with a teaser about exploring measures of dispersion in the following video, which will focus on evaluating the variability of data around the mean.
