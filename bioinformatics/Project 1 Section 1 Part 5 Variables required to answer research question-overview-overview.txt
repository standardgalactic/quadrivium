To conduct effective research after formulating a question and completing a literature search, follow these key steps:

1. **Power Calculation**: Determine the necessary sample size to ensure statistical analysis can detect meaningful effects with sufficient power.

2. **Identifying Patients**: Select patients from relevant registers (e.g., hospital or ward) based on diagnoses pertinent to your research.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - **Type of Infection**: Classify infections as major or minor, categorizing this as nominal data.
   - **Gender**: Record gender as nominal categorical data (male or female).
   - **Age**: Document age, which is ratio numerical continuous data due to its true zero and allowance for mathematical operations.
   - **Admission HbA1c and CRP Levels**: Both are recorded as ratio type numerical continuous data because they have true zero points.

4. **Importance of Data Types**: Recognize the type of data collected (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) to determine suitable statistical analyses using tools like Julia.

5. **Setting Hypotheses**: Formulate hypotheses based on identified variables and their respective data types during research planning.
