The text explains how to represent a line in three-dimensional space using parametric equations. Here's a summary:

1. **Plane Equation**: If you have a vector \( \mathbf{v} = (a, b, c) \), the dot product with another vector from a point \( P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0) \) to any point \( (x, y, z) \) equals zero, it describes a plane through \( P_0 \) perpendicular to \( \mathbf{v} \).

2. **Line Equation**: For a line in space:
   - Consider two points on the line: \( P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0) \) and any point \( P(x, y, z) \).
   - The vector from \( P_0 \) to \( P \) is parallel to a given direction vector \( \mathbf{v} = (a, b, c) \).
   - This relationship can be expressed as:
     \[
     \mathbf{P_0P} = t\mathbf{v}
     \]
     where \( t \) is a scalar.
   - In component form, this gives the parametric equations for the line:
     \[
     x = x_0 + ta, \quad y = y_0 + tb, \quad z = z_0 + tc
     \]

3. **Example**: To find the parametric equations of a line through the point \( (1, 2, -3) \) parallel to the vector \( (4, 5, -7) \):
   - Use the parametric form:
     \[
     x = 1 + 4t, \quad y = 2 + 5t, \quad z = -3 - 7t
     \]

This method allows you to describe a line in space using a point and a direction vector.

The text describes the process of finding a parametric equation for a line in 3D space. Initially, it presents an example with specific equations involving variables \( t \) and coordinates \( x, y, z \). The line can be defined using two points, \( p1 \) and \( p2 \), resulting in a vector direction derived from these points: \( (3, -4, 8) \). 

The parametric form of the line is then expressed as:
- \( x = 2 + 3t \)
- \( y = 4 - 4t \)
- \( z = -1 + 8t \)

Next, the text addresses finding where this line intersects the \( xy \)-plane, which occurs when \( z = 0 \). Solving for \( t \) in the equation \( -1 + 8t = 0 \), we find \( t = \frac{1}{8} \).

Substituting \( t = \frac{1}{8} \) back into the parametric equations for \( x \) and \( y \):
- \( x = 2 + 3(\frac{1}{8}) = \frac{19}{8} \)
- \( y = 4 - 4(\frac{1}{8}) = \frac{7}{2} \)

Thus, the point of intersection with the \( xy \)-plane is \( (\frac{19}{8}, \frac{7}{2}, 0) \).

Finally, it mentions that two planes intersect along a line in three-dimensional space.

To find the equation of a line where two planes intersect, we first convert the plane equations into an augmented matrix. Using Gauss elimination, we transform this matrix into row echelon form. This involves creating leading ones and eliminating other terms in their columns. The resulting system reveals that one variable is dependent on another (e.g., \( z = t \)), allowing us to express the line of intersection parametrically. Thus, the process provides a solution for the intersecting line using matrix operations and elimination techniques.

The text describes the process of finding parametric equations for a line in three-dimensional space. Initially, \( z \) is set to be equal to \( -\frac{6}{11} \), but it is noted that the value of \( z \) is actually given as \( t \). This leads to determining the equation for \( y \) as:

\[ y = -\frac{6}{11} - \frac{2}{11}t \]

Next, they solve for \( x \) using the equation:

\[ x - 3y - 2z = 4 \]

Substituting the known expressions for \( y \) and \( z \), the expression for \( x \) becomes:

\[ x = \frac{26}{11} + \frac{16}{11}t \]

Thus, the parametric equations for the line are:

- \( x = \frac{26}{11} + \frac{16}{11}t \)
- \( y = -\frac{6}{11} - \frac{2}{11}t \)
- \( z = t \)

The parameter \( t \) ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity.
