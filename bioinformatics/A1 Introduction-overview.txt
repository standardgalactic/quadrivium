Jean Club is a surgeon specializing in Acute Care Surgery at Grootiskeer Hospital in Cape Town. He has a keen interest in differential equations due to their numerous real-life applications. Jean notes that traditional textbooks often introduce differential equations through complex real-world problems, which can be challenging for beginners unfamiliar with the mathematics or the scenarios involved.

To address this issue, he proposes starting with fundamental mathematical concepts and working through basic differential equation solutions before applying them to examples. His teaching plan includes covering topics such as separable variable problems (the simplest type), linear equations, exact equations, substitution methods, and numerical methods for solving differential equations. This approach aims to build a strong foundational understanding before tackling more complex applications.
