So in this video I just want us to gain some deeper insight into cosets. Remember if H is a
subgroup of another larger group G and A is an element of G then we have AH that's the left
coset of H under A and HA is on the right hand side is the right coset of H under A.
Now Cayley's table really Cayley's tables help us to get a deeper insight into what is going on
here for if this is the whole of G that I have here and the whole of G the whole of G that I have
there and H is a subgroup of the whole G and I can write this in any order in any order the the
elements so I'm going to take all of the elements in H in the set that makes up the group H and I'm
going to bunch them all in the beginning and then all the rest there's nothing wrong with the order
I can put that in every order so I have my binary operation here and I'd have all the elements of
the binary operation there and if H if A is an element of G it doesn't say anything about it
being an element of H it might be it might not be remember that so I've got these two scenarios here
A is not an element of H and remember how Cayley's tables how they work so I'll have all the elements
of H there and this will be A binary operation with H and here it'll be H binary operation with A
and the way that these work remember we've shown with Cayley's theorem you know these will be unique
and they will be it'll be exhaustive in other words all the elements in H you know all of these elements of
these binary operations they will all occur there and they will all occur there and especially if you
look at this it's easy to understand because this is just a mini Cayley's table you know for a single
group that all these rows and all these columns are unique so they'll all all fit in there so remember
on this side I have a not an element of H and this side I have a being an element of H it says nothing
about a being in there it might be and it might be in there and it might not be in there so what
insights can we gain from the fact that it is there well if a is there it really implies here that
that it's also an element a is also an element of a H the left coset and a is also an element of H a the
right coset why is this so because remember I define these as this and I define this one as this but H is an element of H
H is a group that implies that E must also be an element of that group so if this H is E which it might be the
identity element the identity element the identity element on this side I'm left with A and I'm left with A
so A would then also be an element of this left coset and right coset because the identity element must be there
and you can see that insight that we gain here we can see that insight so this is now going to be an element of as I've written here of the left and right cosets
right cosets and from this from from from the closure problem from the Cayley's theorem we know it must be in you know we know it must be inside one of those because it is exhaustive all the elements must be all the elements must be there therefore A must also be one of those and A must also be one of these and it's easy to prove that
more interesting though if A is not an element of H you'll note that this left coset this right coset is not going to be in the left and right coset which are there you can see that visually but how do we prove that how do we prove that
so if A is not an element of H if A is not an element of H that implies that really the left coset its intersection with H is the empty set and the right coset intersection with H is also the empty set how do we prove that how do we prove that
now let's prove that now let's prove that by contradiction and we first we're going to consider this left coset AH and let's say let let this not be let the intersection so the intersection the intersection is not the empty set and we're saying that A is not an element A is not an element of H
of H so what do we do it's the we're just considering the left here so we say A the left that is an element of the left coset and let's just choose something let's make it H star whatever let's say that's an element of H and I said that this is not the intersection is not empty since these are arbitrary values
I'm going to say well if the intersection there must be something that is equal between these two so let's do that it's equal to H star and I can just rewrite this and get A on its own so I'm going to say A equals H star binary operation with H inverse
now this is an element of H this is an element of H seeing that H is an element of H H is an element of H H is a group that implies that it's inversed by the inverse property must also be an element of H so I have the binary operation between two elements in the set that in a group so that product that binary operation
the product with a binary operation that must also be in other words this binary operation with H inverse that must be an element of H but I've just shown that this equals to A therefore A must be an element of H and that's a contradiction because my first assumption is that it wasn't
I've seen the's. We've seen that it's am anyève band in H yen open. So that p is n знатьten who is an element of H H H so that is a perfect Mamie
the word is a perfect perfect fit this and so do I make a statement. So we know that that is true
and that must be an empty set and the same is going to be go for this. I'm going to assume that the intersection is not an empty set
it's not an empty set and I'm going to have H H and that is that is going to have been... H A that is an element of H A there is an element of H A my right coset and again I'm going to choose this star as an element of Hlight
Again I'm going to choose this star as an element of h and my base assumption was it's not the empty set so we can set them equal, they're arbitrary and we've chosen them just such that these two are equal to each other because they fall in that Venn diagram where it's not an empty set.
And again I can have that a equals h star binary, oops now it's got to be this way around remember left so it's inverse binary operation h star that is an element of h that must be an element of h by this same property so that's an element of h so a is an element of h because that equals that.
And that's also a contradiction because of my base assumption I said here that a is not an element of h, that was my base assumption.
So this is a contradiction and therefore this holds as well and you can clearly see that when we look at this picture here the intersection between these is going to be the empty set.
So you can see this is a very nice proof, Cayley's theorem will help us there and on this side by contradiction very easy to show these that if that is not so then a cannot appear there or at least the intersection between these two.
If a is not an element of h, that intersection between those two will give us the empty set because remember I'm now seeing just the set that makes part of the group and this is a coset, in other words it is a set, I'm just looking at the elements in a set.
So very nice proofs and a nice deeper intuition of really what is going on when we are talking about, you know we are talking about a coset.
So very nice to see you guys.
