Here's another definite integral problem. We asked to get the definite integral from 0 to 2 pi of the sine of x with respect to x and we are obviously working in radians.
That will leave us with what is the anti-derivative of the sine of x. That will be negative the cosine of x and we are going to work on an interval from 0 to 2 pi.
Substituting that is going to leave us with, let's bring the negative out. That's the cosine of x working on an interval from 0 to 2 pi.
That is going to leave us with negative the cosine of 2 pi minus the cosine of minus the cosine of 0. That is going to leave us with a negative cosine of 2 pi is 1 minus the cosine of 0 is 1 and that leaves us with a 0.
