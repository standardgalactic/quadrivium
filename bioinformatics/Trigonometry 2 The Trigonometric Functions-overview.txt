The text explains six trigonometric functions—sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent—that apply to right triangles. In a right triangle with one angle of 90 degrees, these functions are defined in relation to an "angle of interest" (θ). The opposite side is the side across from θ, the adjacent side is next to θ, and the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle.

The trigonometric functions for θ are:
- Sine (sin) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = X / H
- Cosine (cos) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = Y / H
- Tangent (tan) = Opposite / Adjacent = X / Y

Their reciprocals are:
- Cosecant (csc) = 1/sin = Hypotenuse / Opposite = H / X
- Secant (sec) = 1/cos = Hypotenuse / Adjacent = H / Y
- Cotangent (cot) = 1/tan = Adjacent / Opposite = Y / X

The Pythagorean theorem, \(H^2 = X^2 + Y^2\), underlies a fundamental trigonometric identity: \(\sin^2 θ + \cos^2 θ = 1\). Further manipulation shows that \(\tan θ = \frac{\sin θ}{\cos θ}\) and another identity: \(\tan^2 θ + 1 = \sec^2 θ\).

These identities and functions are derived from the geometric properties of right triangles and are essential in trigonometry.
