Acute cholangitis is a serious condition characterized by inflammation and infection due to obstruction in the biliary tree or bile ducts, typically caused by gallstones. This can lead to obstructive jaundice, edema, inflammatory responses, and bacterial overgrowth. The bacteria and their products may enter the bloodstream, causing severe complications like septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death.

The condition is predominantly seen in older adults with a female preponderance but occurs across all ages and genders. Some patients may present with acute cholangitis as their first symptom of biliary disease without prior episodes of biliary colic or cholecystitis.

Diagnosis involves identifying the classic symptoms: pain, jaundice, and fever (often summarized as "Charcot's triad"). More severe cases include organ dysfunction symptoms like delirium and hypotension. Diagnosis can be supported by ultrasound findings of dilated ducts or gallstones and laboratory tests indicating infection or inflammation.

Management requires urgent resuscitation with intravenous fluids based on static and dynamic parameters, prompt blood cultures, and broad-spectrum antibiotics such as coamoxiclav, tailored to the unit's guidelines for acute cholangitis. The Tokyo Guidelines 2018 categorize the severity of acute cholangitis into three grades:

- **Grade 1 (Mild):** Patients can recover with fluid management and antibiotics. Stones may pass or become non-obstructive.
  
- **Grade 2 (Moderate):** Indicators include patient age, bilirubin levels, and other criteria detailed in the Tokyo Guidelines.
  
- **Grade 3 (Severe):** Characterized by organ dysfunction, requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and immediate drainage of the biliary tree. If local facilities can't manage drainage, transferring the patient to a suitable facility is crucial.

The article emphasizes the importance of reading the full Tokyo Guidelines for comprehensive management details, including sections on acute cholecystitis. The guidelines provide structured approaches based on severity grading and are essential for effective treatment and referral processes.
