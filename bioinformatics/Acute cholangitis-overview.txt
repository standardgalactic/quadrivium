Acute cholangitis is a serious condition characterized by inflammation and infection due to obstruction in the biliary tree or bile ducts, typically caused by gallstones. This can lead to obstructive jaundice, edema, inflammatory responses, and bacterial overgrowth. The bacteria and their products may enter the bloodstream, causing severe complications like septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death.

The condition is predominantly seen in older adults with a female preponderance but occurs across all ages and genders. Some patients may present with acute cholangitis as their first symptom of biliary disease without prior episodes of biliary colic or cholecystitis.

Diagnosis involves identifying the classic symptoms: pain, jaundice, and fever (often summarized as "Charcot's triad"). More severe cases include organ dysfunction symptoms like delirium and hypotension. Diagnosis can be supported by ultrasound findings of dilated ducts or gallstones and laboratory tests indicating infection or inflammation.

Management requires urgent resuscitation with intravenous fluids based on static and dynamic parameters, prompt blood cultures, and broad-spectrum antibiotics such as coamoxiclav, tailored to the unit's guidelines for acute cholangitis. The Tokyo Guidelines 2018 categorize the severity of acute cholangitis into three grades:

- **Grade 1 (Mild):** Patients can recover with fluid management and antibiotics. Stones may pass or become non-obstructive.
  
- **Grade 2 (Moderate):** Indicators include patient age, bilirubin levels, and other criteria detailed in the Tokyo Guidelines.
  
- **Grade 3 (Severe):** Characterized by organ dysfunction, requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and immediate drainage of the biliary tree. If local facilities can't manage drainage, transferring the patient to a suitable facility is crucial.

The article emphasizes the importance of reading the full Tokyo Guidelines for comprehensive management details, including sections on acute cholecystitis. The guidelines provide structured approaches based on severity grading and are essential for effective treatment and referral processes.

Acute cholangitis is a serious condition characterized by inflammation, infection, and obstruction in the biliary tree, often due to stones blocking the bile ducts. This can lead to obstructive jaundice, edema, inflammatory response, bacterial overgrowth, sepsis, multi-organ failure, or even death. It predominantly affects older individuals with a female preponderance but can occur across all ages and genders. Some patients may present for the first time with cholangitis despite having no prior symptoms of gallstones.

The Tokyo Guidelines (2018) provide a framework for managing acute cholangitis, categorizing it into three grades based on severity: mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), and severe (grade 3). Diagnosis involves identifying pain, fever, jaundice, and signs of infection or inflammation. Key diagnostic tools include physical examination, ultrasound, blood tests for jaundice, dilated ducts, and white cell count.

Treatment focuses on resuscitation with fluid management based on specific parameters, early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as coamoxiclav), and obtaining blood cultures. For severe cases, immediate biliary drainage through percutaneous cholangiography or ERCP is crucial. If such facilities are unavailable, the patient must be transferred to a suitable location after initial stabilization.

Patients with mild cholangitis can often recover with fluid management and antibiotics alone. However, those with moderate to severe conditions require more intensive care, including possible biliary drainage and specialized hospitalization. The Tokyo Guidelines emphasize timely referral for gallbladder removal in chronic cases or further workup if necessary. It is recommended that healthcare providers familiarize themselves with these guidelines to ensure effective patient management.
