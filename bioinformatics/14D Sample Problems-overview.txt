The text outlines various algebraic manipulations involving complex numbers and provides step-by-step solutions for different problems.

1. **Solving Equations with Complex Numbers**: The first part involves solving the equation \( x + y + (x - yi) = 3 + i \). By separating real and imaginary parts, two equations are formed: \( x + y = 3 \) and \( x - y = 1 \). Solving these yields \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \).

2. **Solving for Complex Number \( z \)**:
   - In one instance, the equation is rearranged to find \( z \), yielding real and imaginary components: \( z = 2 + 3i \).
   - Another equation manipulation results in \( z = -2 + i(7 - 6) \).

3. **Multiplying Complex Numbers**:
   - For two complex numbers, \( z_1 \cdot z_2 \), the calculation involves distributing terms and using the identity \( i^2 = -1 \). Example: multiplying \( (3i)(1 - i) \) results in \( 3 + 3i \).
   - Squaring a complex number like \( z_1^2 = (2 + 4i)^2 \) leads to simplification using the same identity.

4. **Expression Simplification**:
   - Simplifying expressions involving roots and imaginary components, such as multiplying \( (\sqrt{2} + i)(-\sqrt{2}i)(1 + \sqrt{2}i) \), requires careful distribution and use of identities like \( i^2 = -1 \).

Overall, the text demonstrates various algebraic techniques for handling complex numbers, emphasizing separation into real and imaginary parts, using identities, and performing standard operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and simplification.

The text describes several mathematical operations involving complex numbers and real numbers:

1. \(i \times i\) results in \(i^2\), which is \(-1\) because the imaginary unit squared equals negative one.

2. A negative times a positive yields a negative result.

3. The square root of 2 (\(\sqrt{2}\)) is mentioned, but not directly calculated from prior operations.

4. The product of \(-2\) and \(-1\) results in \(+2\).

5. Combining these gives the expression \(2 + \sqrt{2}\).

6. There's a combination involving positive \(i\) and negative \(\sqrt{a}\), leading to an expression: \(1 - \sqrt{2}i\).

7. This expression can also be written as \(1 + i(1 - \sqrt{2})\). 

These steps mix real numbers, imaginary units, and their interactions in algebraic expressions.

The text provides a series of steps and solutions for solving algebraic equations involving complex numbers. Here’s a summary:

1. **Solving x + y + (x - yi) = 3 + i:**
   - Separate into real and imaginary parts to form two equations:
     - Real part: \(x + y = 3\)
     - Imaginary part: \(x - y = 1\)
   - Solve these equations to find \(x = 2\) and \(y = 1\).

2. **Solving for a complex number z:**
   - Example problem where algebraic manipulation isolates \(z\), simplifying real and imaginary components.

3. **Multiplication of Complex Numbers:**
   - Multiply two complex numbers, e.g., \(z_1 \times z_2\) (e.g., \(3i(1-i)\) resulting in \(3 + 3i\)).
   - Compute \(z_1^2\) (e.g., \((3i)^2 = -9\)).

4. **Complex Number Operations:**
   - Example of multiplying more complex expressions involving i, like simplifying and expanding terms:
     - \( (2+4i)(1-5i) \), resulting in a simplified form.

5. **Simplification:**
   - Simplify expressions such as \((\sqrt{2} + i)(-\sqrt{2}i(1+\sqrt{2}i))\) by distributing and combining like terms, focusing on real and imaginary parts separately.

The text emphasizes breaking down complex number problems into manageable steps using algebraic techniques to separate and solve for real and imaginary components.

The text breaks down a mathematical expression involving complex numbers and roots. Here’s the summary:

1. It starts with \( i \times i = i^2 \), which is generally understood as -1 in complex number arithmetic.

2. Next, it describes multiplying a negative by a positive to get a negative result.

3. The text mentions obtaining \(\sqrt{2}\).

4. Then, it calculates \(-2 \times -1\), resulting in \(+2\). Thus, combining results gives \(2 + \sqrt{2}\).

5. It then discusses having \(i\) (positive) and a negative square root term: \(1 - \sqrt{2}i\).

6. Finally, it suggests this expression can also be written as \(1 + i - \sqrt{2}\), which is how some books might present it.

Overall, the text describes combining operations with complex numbers to simplify expressions involving real and imaginary parts.
