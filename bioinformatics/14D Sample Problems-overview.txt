The text outlines various algebraic manipulations involving complex numbers and provides step-by-step solutions for different problems.

1. **Solving Equations with Complex Numbers**: The first part involves solving the equation \( x + y + (x - yi) = 3 + i \). By separating real and imaginary parts, two equations are formed: \( x + y = 3 \) and \( x - y = 1 \). Solving these yields \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \).

2. **Solving for Complex Number \( z \)**:
   - In one instance, the equation is rearranged to find \( z \), yielding real and imaginary components: \( z = 2 + 3i \).
   - Another equation manipulation results in \( z = -2 + i(7 - 6) \).

3. **Multiplying Complex Numbers**:
   - For two complex numbers, \( z_1 \cdot z_2 \), the calculation involves distributing terms and using the identity \( i^2 = -1 \). Example: multiplying \( (3i)(1 - i) \) results in \( 3 + 3i \).
   - Squaring a complex number like \( z_1^2 = (2 + 4i)^2 \) leads to simplification using the same identity.

4. **Expression Simplification**:
   - Simplifying expressions involving roots and imaginary components, such as multiplying \( (\sqrt{2} + i)(-\sqrt{2}i)(1 + \sqrt{2}i) \), requires careful distribution and use of identities like \( i^2 = -1 \).

Overall, the text demonstrates various algebraic techniques for handling complex numbers, emphasizing separation into real and imaginary parts, using identities, and performing standard operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and simplification.

The text describes several mathematical operations involving complex numbers and real numbers:

1. \(i \times i\) results in \(i^2\), which is \(-1\) because the imaginary unit squared equals negative one.

2. A negative times a positive yields a negative result.

3. The square root of 2 (\(\sqrt{2}\)) is mentioned, but not directly calculated from prior operations.

4. The product of \(-2\) and \(-1\) results in \(+2\).

5. Combining these gives the expression \(2 + \sqrt{2}\).

6. There's a combination involving positive \(i\) and negative \(\sqrt{a}\), leading to an expression: \(1 - \sqrt{2}i\).

7. This expression can also be written as \(1 + i(1 - \sqrt{2})\). 

These steps mix real numbers, imaginary units, and their interactions in algebraic expressions.
