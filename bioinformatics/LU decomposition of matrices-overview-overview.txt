The text outlines the process of transforming a given matrix into an upper triangular form using elementary row operations, which is part of LU decomposition in linear algebra. Here's a concise summary:

### Initial Matrix:
- The matrix \( A \) to be transformed is:
  \[
  A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 1 \\ 2 & 5 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
  \]

### Elementary Row Operations:

1. **First Operation (E1):**
   - Objective: Eliminate the element in the second row, first column.
   - Operation: \( R_2 = R_2 - 2R_1 \).
   - Resulting Matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & -1 \\ 2 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
     \]

2. **Second Operation (E2):**
   - Objective: Eliminate the element in the third row, first column.
   - Operation: \( R_3 = R_3 - 2R_1 \).
   - Resulting Matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & -1 \\ 0 & -5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Third Operation (E3):**
   - Objective: Eliminate the element in the third row, second column.
   - Operation: \( R_3 = R_3 + 5R_2 \).
   - Resulting Matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & -5 \end{bmatrix}
     \]

### Final Upper Triangular Matrix:

- The final matrix \( U \) is in upper triangular form:
  \[
  U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & -5 \end{bmatrix}
  \]

### LU Decomposition Context:

- **LU Decomposition**: The process of expressing a matrix \( A \) as the product of a lower triangular matrix \( L \) and an upper triangular matrix \( U \).
- **Elementary Row Operations**: These operations are used to transform \( A \) into \( U \), while \( L \) is constructed from the multipliers used during these operations.
- **No Row Swapping**: Strict LU decomposition avoids row interchanges, maintaining the triangular structure.

### Conclusion:

The text provides a step-by-step guide on using elementary row operations to achieve an upper triangular form of a matrix. This is part of the broader LU decomposition process, which is essential for solving linear systems and other matrix computations.
