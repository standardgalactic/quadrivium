Let's have a look at how Julia just handles these special roots like square root SQRT would be the
function square root and the square root of 9 of course is the 3. We can also do cube roots.
So let's say the cube root of 27 that's of course going to be 3 as well. We have the natural
exponential the value e so I can say exp now in the value e to the power 1 is just going to be
itself so this would be a way for us to see what the value is that does hold 2.71828 etc etc.
So that's just e to the power and I can put in any power there I like. If I want a more accuracy when
x is near 0 in the case of the exponent of x so that x minus 1 if say 0 minus 1 that's going to be
negative 1. If I want to 4 well Julia was written such that you can have more accuracy there if you
didn't do that if I were just to type in the exp of something that's very close to negative 1 in
other words so if I put 0 in there 0 minus 1 is negative 1 something very close to 0 not 0 exactly
I'm going to get a bit of I'm going to get into a bit of a problem so it's not going to be that
accurate so for that reason we have exp in 1 which if I put in now I mustn't put the 0 minus 1 the
negative 1 in there I must put what the value of x would have been in there so say 0.0001 if I put
in there I'm going to get a more accurate result. Now we have the log function which is the natural log
so base e so if I were to put in there the log of 100 just to show you that it's not log base 10
that we're going to get back but we're getting back this log base e now I can specify the log that
I want say I want log base 10 comma 100 so if I do two arguments there put the first one in it's going
to force the first value there to force the issue it's going to be log base 10 and now we're going to
get back 2 because 10 to the power 2 gives me 100 and you see here there's also log 2 and log 10
these are special functions that will do log base 2 and log base 10 without you having to specify 2 or
10 but doing it this way you can specify any base and just as we had for something that's accurate
when you get close to x being 0 here so 1 plus 0.0001 so the log if I were to take the log of
1.00001 it's going to be slightly inaccurate in its calculation so I have the special function called
log 1p and now I have to put in the value of x in there so 0.0001 to that gets added 1 and it's that
1 plus 1.00001 which log natural log I'm taking and you get a much more you get an accurate value
there lastly for this little section there are numerous special functions which you can just use
I've just listed a few here the error function the inverse of the inverse function of the error function
or to the error function the gamma function the beta function there there are many many of them if you
interested in advanced mathematics and eventually in this series we'll get to using some of them
we'll get to know some of the more common special functions but there are indeed quite a few of them
