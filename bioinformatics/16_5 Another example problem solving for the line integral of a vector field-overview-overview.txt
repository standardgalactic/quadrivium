The text discusses calculating the work done by a force field on an object moving along a circular path. The force field is defined as \( F(x, y) = (x^2, xy) \), and the motion occurs around the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) in an anti-clockwise direction.

The main point is that since the object returns to its starting position after completing one revolution, the net displacement is zero. Consequently, no work is done by the force field over this closed path, consistent with the behavior of conservative vector fields where the line integral around a closed loop is zero.

To prove this mathematically, polar coordinates are used: \( x = \cos(\theta) \), \( y = \sin(\theta) \). The parametric equations for the circle become clear, and the path in vector form is \( (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)) \).

The derivative with respect to \(\theta\) gives the tangent vector \( (-\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta)) \). Substituting these into the force field, a dot product is calculated, leading to a definite integral from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \). This integral simplifies to zero as the terms cancel each other out.

This confirms mathematically that no net work is done when an object moves once around a closed path in this force field.
