The text discusses solving a specific type of second-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation: \(x^2 y'' - 2xy' - 4y = 0\). This equation features the variable raised to the power of two, which matches the order of the derivatives.

To solve it, the author proposes using the method where \(y = x^m\), leading to first and second derivatives: \(y' = mx^{m-1}\) and \(y'' = m(m-1)x^{m-2}\). These expressions are substituted back into the differential equation:

\[x^2 y'' - 2xy' - 4y = 0.\]

After substitution and simplification, the author derives an auxiliary equation from the coefficients of \(x^m\):

\[m^2 - 3m - 4 = 0.\]

This quadratic equation factors to \((m + 1)(m - 4) = 0\), giving roots \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = 4\). Thus, the general solution to the differential equation is:

\[y = c_1 x^{-1} + c_2 x^4.\]

This method effectively demonstrates solving this special type of linear differential equation using a power-based approach.

The text describes a process for solving a specific type of homogeneous, linear, second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) where the non-constant variable's exponent matches the order of the derivative. The given ODE is:

\[ x^2 y'' - 2xy' - 4y = 0 \]

To solve it, an assumed solution of the form \( y = x^m \) is substituted into the equation. Differentiating \( y \), we obtain \( y' = mx^{m-1} \) and \( y'' = m(m-1)x^{m-2} \). Substituting these expressions back into the ODE yields:

\[ x^2 (m(m-1)x^{m-2}) - 2x(mx^{m-1}) - 4x^m = 0 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ m^2x^m - mx^m - 2mx^m - 4x^m = 0 \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ (m^2 - 3m - 4)x^m = 0 \]

Since \( x^m \neq 0 \), we solve the auxiliary equation:

\[ m^2 - 3m - 4 = 0 \]

Factoring, we find:

\[ (m + 1)(m - 4) = 0 \]

Thus, the roots are \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = 4 \). The general solution to the differential equation is then:

\[ y = c_1 x^{-1} + c_2 x^4 \]

This method highlights solving a special class of linear ODEs by assuming power-law solutions and determining constants using an auxiliary equation.
