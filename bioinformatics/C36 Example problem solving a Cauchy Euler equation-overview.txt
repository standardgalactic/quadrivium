The text discusses solving a specific type of second-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation: \(x^2 y'' - 2xy' - 4y = 0\). This equation features the variable raised to the power of two, which matches the order of the derivatives.

To solve it, the author proposes using the method where \(y = x^m\), leading to first and second derivatives: \(y' = mx^{m-1}\) and \(y'' = m(m-1)x^{m-2}\). These expressions are substituted back into the differential equation:

\[x^2 y'' - 2xy' - 4y = 0.\]

After substitution and simplification, the author derives an auxiliary equation from the coefficients of \(x^m\):

\[m^2 - 3m - 4 = 0.\]

This quadratic equation factors to \((m + 1)(m - 4) = 0\), giving roots \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = 4\). Thus, the general solution to the differential equation is:

\[y = c_1 x^{-1} + c_2 x^4.\]

This method effectively demonstrates solving this special type of linear differential equation using a power-based approach.
