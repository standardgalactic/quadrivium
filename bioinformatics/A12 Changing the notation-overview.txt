The text is explaining how to express solutions for a system involving complex eigenvalues of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Complex Exponential Representation**: A complex number in exponential form, \(e^{\alpha t + i\beta t}\), can be rewritten as \(e^{\alpha t}(\cos(\beta t) + i\sin(\beta t))\).

2. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**:
   - Consider an eigenvector with components involving complex numbers, such as \(1\) and \(-1 + 0i\), which can be expressed in terms of real and imaginary parts.
   - Denote the real part of a complex eigenvalue's corresponding eigenvector as \(b_1\) and the imaginary part as \(b_2\).

3. **General Solution Form**:
   - For a \(2 \times 2\) matrix with complex conjugate eigenvalues, the general solution involves expressions like:
     - \(x_1 = e^{\alpha t}(b_1 \cos(\beta t) - b_2 \sin(\beta t))\)
     - \(x_2 = e^{\alpha t}(b_1 \sin(\beta t) + b_2 \cos(\beta t))\)

4. **Solution Set**:
   - The complete solution is a linear combination of these solutions: \(c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2\), where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - To proceed, one would typically substitute specific values or further analyze the system to find particular solutions or interpret them in a given context.
