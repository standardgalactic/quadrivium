The text is explaining how to express solutions for a system involving complex eigenvalues of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix. Here’s a summary:

1. **Complex Exponential Representation**: A complex number in exponential form, \(e^{\alpha t + i\beta t}\), can be rewritten as \(e^{\alpha t}(\cos(\beta t) + i\sin(\beta t))\).

2. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**:
   - Consider an eigenvector with components involving complex numbers, such as \(1\) and \(-1 + 0i\), which can be expressed in terms of real and imaginary parts.
   - Denote the real part of a complex eigenvalue's corresponding eigenvector as \(b_1\) and the imaginary part as \(b_2\).

3. **General Solution Form**:
   - For a \(2 \times 2\) matrix with complex conjugate eigenvalues, the general solution involves expressions like:
     - \(x_1 = e^{\alpha t}(b_1 \cos(\beta t) - b_2 \sin(\beta t))\)
     - \(x_2 = e^{\alpha t}(b_1 \sin(\beta t) + b_2 \cos(\beta t))\)

4. **Solution Set**:
   - The complete solution is a linear combination of these solutions: \(c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2\), where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - To proceed, one would typically substitute specific values or further analyze the system to find particular solutions or interpret them in a given context.

The text explains how to handle complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors in solving systems of differential equations for a 2x2 matrix. Here’s a summary:

1. **Complex Exponentials**: The expression \( e^{(\alpha + i\beta)t} \) is rewritten as \( e^{\alpha t} (\cos(\beta t) + i \sin(\beta t)) \).

2. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**: For a complex eigenvector \( k_1 = 1 - i \), it can be expressed in terms of its real part \( b_1 = 1 \) and imaginary part \( b_2 = -1 \). The corresponding eigenvalue is complex, and its conjugate pair \( (\lambda_1, \lambda_2) \) has the same form.

3. **General Solution**: For a 2x2 system with complex eigenvalues:
   - \( x_1(t) = e^{\alpha t} (b_1 \cos(\beta t) - b_2 \sin(\beta t)) \)
   - \( x_2(t) = e^{\alpha t} (b_1 \sin(\beta t) + b_2 \cos(\beta t)) \)

4. **Solution Set**: The general solution is a linear combination of these solutions: \( c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants.

The first step in applying this method involves identifying the complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, then expressing them in terms of their real and imaginary components.
