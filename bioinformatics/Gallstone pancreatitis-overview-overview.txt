Biliary pancreatitis is a form of pancreatic inflammation triggered by bile duct-related issues, commonly due to gallstones obstructing the Ampulla of Vater. This condition differs from other types like alcoholic pancreatitis and mainly affects older adults, especially females. Symptoms include severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and a history of biliary colic or cholelithiasis.

**Presentation and Diagnosis:**
- Symptomatic presentation often involves tenderness in the upper abdomen, tachycardia, and sometimes fever.
- An erect chest X-ray is performed to exclude hollow viscous perforation by checking for free air absence.
- Elevated serum lipase levels confirm diagnosis, with lipase preferred over amylase due to its longer persistence.

**Management:**
- Initial management focuses on supportive care, including pain relief with morphine and maintaining fluid/electrolyte balance. 
- Patients remain nil per os (nothing by mouth) until they can eat without pain.
- Intravenous fluids are adjusted based on electrolytes and urine output.
- Antibiotics are reserved for evidence of infection or complications in severe cases; proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be used but aren't universally recommended.

**Course and Intervention:**
- Most patients improve within 48 hours as gallstones pass through the biliary tract.
- A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is typically performed during hospitalization to prevent recurrence once recovery starts.
- If symptoms persist or worsen, imaging such as ERCP may be needed for stone removal due to possible impaction.

The condition requires prompt transfer of non-improving patients to facilities equipped to handle complications like severe pancreatitis or obstructive jaundice. Treatment aims at symptom relief and addressing bile duct issues, sometimes involving surgical intervention to remove gallstones.
