In Lecture 2, participants are invited to relax and enjoy a sneak preview of the course content. They will observe a significant amount of computer code being written, but there's no need to focus on understanding it at this stage. Instead, they should pay attention to the statistical results generated from these calculations. By the end of the lecture, attendees will have a clear idea of what has been accomplished and displayed on the screen. The emphasis is on appreciating the outcomes rather than the coding process itself.

In Lecture 2, participants are given a sneak preview of the course's content without needing to focus too much on the details. The lecture includes demonstrations of computer code being written, but viewers are encouraged not to worry about understanding it at this stage. Instead, they should concentrate on interpreting the statistical results derived from these calculations and observe the outcomes of the processes demonstrated.
