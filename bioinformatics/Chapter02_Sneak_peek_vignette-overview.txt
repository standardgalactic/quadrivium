In Lecture 2, participants are invited to relax and enjoy a sneak preview of the course content. They will observe a significant amount of computer code being written, but there's no need to focus on understanding it at this stage. Instead, they should pay attention to the statistical results generated from these calculations. By the end of the lecture, attendees will have a clear idea of what has been accomplished and displayed on the screen. The emphasis is on appreciating the outcomes rather than the coding process itself.
