The text explains how to derive the fundamental equations for simple harmonic motion (SHM) by using the concept of uniform circular motion. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Displacement**: SHM can be visualized as the projection of a point moving in a circle at constant angular velocity onto an axis. The displacement \( x(t) \) is given by:
   \[
   x(t) = x_m \cos(\omega t + \phi)
   \]
   where \( x_m \) is the amplitude, \( \omega \) is the angular velocity, and \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

2. **Velocity**: The velocity in SHM is obtained by differentiating the displacement equation with respect to time or through uniform circular motion geometry:
   \[
   v(t) = -\omega x_m \sin(\omega t + \phi)
   \]
   This shows that velocity is zero at maximum displacement and reaches its peak as it passes through equilibrium.

3. **Acceleration**: The acceleration is derived by differentiating the velocity equation or using centripetal acceleration from circular motion:
   \[
   a(t) = -\omega^2 x_m \cos(\omega t + \phi)
   \]
   This indicates that acceleration is maximum at points of maximum displacement and zero at equilibrium.

The text highlights understanding SHM through its relationship with uniform circular motion, using angular velocity and trigonometric functions to describe oscillatory behavior.
