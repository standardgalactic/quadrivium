Certainly! It looks like you're exploring factoring, specifically factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) from an algebraic expression. Let's break down your example \(x^2 - 3x\) and see how to factor it by identifying common elements.

### Given Expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x \]

### Factoring Process:

1. **Identify Common Factors:**
   - Look at each term in the expression.
   - The first term is \(x^2\), which can be rewritten as \(x \cdot x\).
   - The second term is \(-3x\).

2. **Find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF):**
   - Both terms have an \(x\) as a factor.
   - Therefore, the GCF of \(x^2\) and \(-3x\) is \(x\).

3. **Factor Out the GCF:**
   - Divide each term by the GCF (\(x\)) and write the expression in factored form:
   \[
   x(x) - x(3) = x(x - 3)
   \]

### Result:
The expression \(x^2 - 3x\) can be factored as:
\[ x(x - 3) \]

### Explanation:
- By factoring out the common factor \(x\), you're expressing the original quadratic expression as a product of two factors: \(x\) and \((x - 3)\).
- This is similar to reversing the distribution process, where you initially distributed \(x\) across the terms in the parenthesis.

### Summary:
Factoring by identifying common elements involves finding the GCF of all terms in an expression and then rewriting the expression as a product of this GCF and another polynomial. In your example, the factored form is \(x(x - 3)\). This process simplifies expressions and can be useful for solving equations or further algebraic manipulation.

To factor the expression \(6x^2 + 9xy\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients and identify any common variables.

### Step-by-Step Factorization:

1. **Identify the Coefficients:**
   - The coefficients are 6 and 9.

2. **Prime Factorization of Coefficients:**
   - \(6 = 2 \times 3\)
   - \(9 = 3 \times 3\)

3. **Find the GCD of the Coefficients:**
   - The common prime factor is 3.
   - Therefore, the GCD of 6 and 9 is 3.

4. **Identify Common Variables:**
   - Both terms have at least one \(x\).

5. **Factor Out the GCD and Common Variables:**
   - Factor out \(3x\) from both terms:
     \[
     6x^2 + 9xy = 3x(2x) + 3x(3y)
     \]

6. **Write the Factored Expression:**
   - The expression can be factored as:
     \[
     6x^2 + 9xy = 3x(2x + 3y)
     \]

### Conclusion:

The factored form of \(6x^2 + 9xy\) is \(3x(2x + 3y)\). This process involves finding the greatest common divisor of the coefficients and identifying any shared variables to factor them out from the expression.

To factor the quadratic expression \(2x^2 + 7x + 3\), we need two binomials of the form \((ax + b)(cx + d)\) such that when expanded, they give back the original polynomial. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Identify the Coefficients:**
   - The quadratic term coefficient \(a = 2\).
   - The linear term coefficient \(b = 7\).
   - The constant term \(c = 3\).

2. **Multiply \(a\) and \(c\):**
   - Multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term: \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

3. **Find Two Numbers that Multiply to \(ac\) and Add to \(b\):**
   - We need two numbers whose product is 6 and whose sum is 7.
   - The numbers are 6 and 1 because \(6 \times 1 = 6\) and \(6 + 1 = 7\).

4. **Rewrite the Middle Term:**
   - Rewrite \(7x\) as \(6x + 1x\).
   - So, \(2x^2 + 7x + 3\) becomes \(2x^2 + 6x + 1x + 3\).

5. **Factor by Grouping:**
   - Group the terms: \((2x^2 + 6x) + (1x + 3)\).
   - Factor out the greatest common factor from each group:
     - From \(2x^2 + 6x\), factor out \(2x\): \(2x(x + 3)\).
     - From \(1x + 3\), factor out 1: \(1(x + 3)\).

6. **Factor Out the Common Binomial:**
   - Notice that \((x + 3)\) is common in both groups.
   - Factor it out: \((2x + 1)(x + 3)\).

Thus, the factored form of \(2x^2 + 7x + 3\) is \((2x + 1)(x + 3)\). 

You can verify this by expanding the factors:
\[
(2x + 1)(x + 3) = 2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3) = 2x^2 + 6x + x + 3 = 2x^2 + 7x + 3
\]
This confirms that the factorization is correct.

You're working with polynomial expressions, specifically focusing on factoring techniques. Let's break down what you have:

1. **General Quadratic Form**:  
   A quadratic expression can be written as \( ax^2 + bx + c \). In your examples, sometimes the middle term (\(bx\)) is zero, simplifying the expression.

2. **Difference of Squares**:  
   This form is given by \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \). It's characterized by two perfect squares separated by a subtraction sign.

3. **Examples**:

   - **\( x^2 - 25 \)**:  
     Recognize that this can be rewritten as \( x^2 - 5^2 \), which is a difference of squares. Thus, it factors to:
     \[
     (x - 5)(x + 5)
     \]

   - **\( 25x^2 - 81y^2 \)**:  
     Notice that both terms are perfect squares:
     \[
     (5x)^2 - (9y)^2
     \]
     Applying the difference of squares formula, it factors to:
     \[
     (5x - 9y)(5x + 9y)
     \]

4. **Common Factor**:  
   In expressions like \( 40x^2 - 40x - 240 \), first factor out the greatest common divisor (GCD):
   \[
   40(x^2 - x - 6)
   \]
   Then, factor the quadratic inside the parentheses:
   \[
   40((x - 3)(x + 2))
   \]

5. **Zero Middle Term**:  
   When a quadratic has no middle term (\(bx = 0\)), it often indicates a difference of squares or simplifies further factoring.

By recognizing these patterns and applying the appropriate formulas, you can efficiently factor many polynomial expressions. If you have any specific questions or need further examples, feel free to ask!

The text provides an overview of algebraic techniques involving the factorization of expressions, focusing on two main concepts: the difference of squares and cubes, as well as factoring rational expressions. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Difference of Squares**: This involves expressing a term in the form \(a^2 - b^2\) which can be factored into \((a-b)(a+b)\). An example given is \(25x^2 - 81y^2\), which factors to \((5x-9y)(5x+9y)\).

2. **Difference and Sum of Cubes**: 
   - The difference of cubes, expressed as \(a^3 - b^3\), can be factored into \((a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\).
   - The sum of cubes, \(a^3 + b^3\), factors to \((a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\). An example provided is \(\frac{2x^2 + 7x + 6}{x^2 - 4}\).

3. **Factoring Rational Expressions**: This involves dividing one polynomial by another and simplifying the expression through factorization.
   - In the example given, \( \frac{2x^2 + 7x + 6}{x^2 - 4} \), the numerator is factored into \((2x+3)(x+2)\) and the denominator as a difference of squares into \((x-2)(x+2)\).
   - Simplifying by canceling common factors, such as \( (x+2) \), results in the expression reducing to \(\frac{2x+3}{x-2}\).

The text emphasizes understanding these factorization techniques for simplification and solving algebraic expressions effectively.

Sure, letâ€™s work through the problem step-by-step.

You have the expression \(x^2 - 3x\) and you want to factor it by identifying common elements in each term.

### Step 1: Identify Common Factors

The terms in your expression are:

- \(x^2\)
- \(-3x\)

Both of these terms share a common factor of \(x\).

### Step 2: Factor Out the Common Element

To factor out the common element, you take it outside of a parenthesis. In this case, you'll factor \(x\) out:

1. From \(x^2\), when you factor out \(x\), you are left with \(x\).
2. From \(-3x\), when you factor out \(x\), you are left with \(-3\).

This gives you:

\[ x(x - 3) \]

### Step 3: Verify

To ensure that the factoring is correct, you can distribute (expand) the expression back to its original form:

- Distribute \(x\) across the terms inside the parenthesis:
  - \(x \cdot x = x^2\)
  - \(x \cdot (-3) = -3x\)

This results in the original expression: 

\[ x^2 - 3x \]

### Conclusion

The factored form of \(x^2 - 3x\) is:

\[ x(x - 3) \]

This process shows how you can factor out the greatest common factor from a polynomial. In this case, it was simply \(x\).

Let's break down the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) through prime factorization for the expression \(6x^2 + 9xy\), and then we'll factor it completely.

### Step-by-Step Factorization

1. **Factor Each Term Individually:**
   - For \(6x^2\):
     - Prime factorization of 6 is \(2 \times 3\).
     - So, \(6x^2 = 2 \times 3 \times x \times x\).

   - For \(9xy\):
     - Prime factorization of 9 is \(3 \times 3\).
     - So, \(9xy = 3 \times 3 \times x \times y\).

2. **Identify Common Factors:**
   - Both terms have a common factor of \(3\) and \(x\).
   - Therefore, the GCD of the coefficients (6 and 9) is 3.
   - The GCD for the variable part is \(x\) because both terms contain at least one \(x\).

3. **Combine Common Factors:**
   - The overall GCD of the expression is \(3x\).

4. **Factor Out the GCD:**
   - Factor \(3x\) out of each term:
     \[
     6x^2 + 9xy = 3x(2x) + 3x(3y)
     \]

5. **Write the Factored Expression:**
   - Combine the factored terms:
     \[
     6x^2 + 9xy = 3x(2x + 3y)
     \]

### Conclusion

The expression \(6x^2 + 9xy\) can be factored as \(3x(2x + 3y)\) by identifying and extracting the greatest common divisor, which is \(3x\). This method of using prime factorization to find the GCD helps simplify polynomial expressions efficiently.

To factor the quadratic expression \(2x^2 + 7x + 3\), we need two binomials of the form \((ax + b)(cx + d)\). Given that your leading coefficient (the coefficient of \(x^2\)) is 2, one of these binomial terms will be \(2x\) and the other will be \(x\).

Let's break it down:

1. **Identify the product:** The constant term is 3. We need two numbers whose product is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) (the product of the leading coefficient and the constant term) and whose sum is 7 (the middle coefficient).

2. **Find suitable pairs:** The pair of numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 7 are 6 and 1.

3. **Rewrite the middle term:** Use these numbers to split the middle term:
   \[
   2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 2x^2 + 6x + x + 3
   \]

4. **Factor by grouping:**
   - Group the terms: \((2x^2 + 6x) + (x + 3)\)
   - Factor out the greatest common factor from each group:
     \[
     = 2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3)
     \]

5. **Factor out the common binomial:**
   - Notice that \((x + 3)\) is a common factor:
     \[
     = (2x + 1)(x + 3)
     \]

Thus, the factored form of \(2x^2 + 7x + 3\) is \((2x + 1)(x + 3)\).

You're exploring polynomial factoring, particularly focusing on differences of squares. Let's break down what you're examining:

### Differences of Squares

A difference of squares takes the form:
\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \]

This identity works because when expanded:
- \( (a - b)(a + b) = a(a + b) - b(a + b) \)
- Which simplifies to: \( a^2 + ab - ab - b^2 \)
- Resulting in: \( a^2 - b^2 \)

### Examples

1. **\( x^2 - 25 \):**
   - Recognize that \( 25 = 5^2 \).
   - So, \( x^2 - 25 = (x)^2 - (5)^2 \).
   - Apply the difference of squares: 
     \[ (x - 5)(x + 5) \]

2. **\( 25x^2 - 81y^2 \):**
   - Recognize that \( 25 = 5^2 \) and \( 81 = 9^2 \).
   - So, \( 25x^2 - 81y^2 = (5x)^2 - (9y)^2 \).
   - Apply the difference of squares:
     \[ (5x - 9y)(5x + 9y) \]

### Key Points

- **Identify Squares:** Look for terms that are perfect squares.
- **Apply Formula:** Use \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \).
- **Simplify:** Ensure the expression is simplified after factoring.

This method is efficient for quickly factoring expressions of this form. If you have more examples or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

The text explains algebraic techniques for simplifying expressions, focusing on factoring differences of squares, cubes, and rational expressions. Here's a summary:

1. **Difference of Squares**: 
   - The expression \(a^2 - b^2\) can be factored as \((a - b)(a + b)\).
   - Example: For terms like \(5x\), the difference \(25x^2 - 81y^2\) simplifies to \((5x - 9y)(5x + 9y)\).

2. **Difference and Sum of Cubes**:
   - The expression \(a^3 - b^3\) factors as \((a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\).
   - The sum \(a^3 + b^3\) factors as \((a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\).
   - Example: For a cube difference like \(27x^3 - 8\), it becomes \((3x - 2)((3x)^2 + (3x)(2) + 2^2)\).

3. **Rational Expressions**:
   - These are fractions where both the numerator and denominator are polynomials.
   - To simplify, factor both parts and cancel common factors.
   - Example: Simplify \(\frac{2x^2 + 7x + 6}{x^2 - 4}\) by factoring to \(\frac{(2x+3)(x+2)}{(x-2)(x+2)}\), then cancel the \(x+2\) terms, resulting in \(\frac{2x+3}{x-2}\).

The text emphasizes using these algebraic strategies to simplify complex expressions into more manageable forms.
