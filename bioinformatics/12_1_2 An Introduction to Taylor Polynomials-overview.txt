The text explains Taylor's theorem for approximating functions using a polynomial. The prerequisites are that \( f \) must have continuous derivatives up to order \( n+1 \) on a closed interval \([a, b]\), and be differentiable on the open interval \((a, b)\). For a function \( f \) at a point \( p \) within this interval, Taylor's theorem states that for every \( x \) in the open interval, there exists some value \( c \) between \( x \) and \( p \) such that:

\[ f(x) = T_n(x) + R_n(x), \]

where \( T_n(x) \) is the \( n \)-th order Taylor polynomial at \( p \), and \( R_n(x) \) is the remainder or error term. The Lagrange form of the remainder for the Taylor series expansion to the \( n \)-th degree is given by:

\[ R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x - p)^{n+1}. \]

The text uses an example involving approximating \( f(x) = \ln x \) around \( p = 1 \). It calculates the third-order Taylor polynomial:

\[ T_3(x) = f(p) + f'(p)(x-p) + \frac{f''(p)}{2!}(x-p)^2 + \frac{f'''(p)}{3!}(x-p)^3. \]

Calculating derivatives for \( f(x) = \ln x \):
- \( f(p) = \ln 1 = 0 \),
- \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} \Rightarrow f'(1) = 1 \),
- \( f''(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2} \Rightarrow f''(1) = -1 \),
- \( f'''(x) = \frac{2}{x^3} \Rightarrow f'''(1) = 2 \).

The third-order Taylor polynomial is:

\[ T_3(x) = (x-1) - \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} + \frac{2(x-1)^3}{6}. \]

This example illustrates how to choose a sensible point \( p \) and order of approximation based on the problem context, ensuring that calculations remain manageable.

The text describes the process of calculating a third-order Taylor polynomial for \( \ln(x) \) at \( p = 1 \), specifically aiming to approximate \( \ln(1.03) \). The polynomial derived is:

\[ x - 2 + \frac{3}{3} = x - 2 + 1 = x - 1 \]

The next step involves substituting \( x = 1.03 \) into the Taylor polynomial, resulting in:

\[ 0.03 - \frac{(0.03)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.03)^3}{6} \]

This provides an estimated value for \( \ln(1.03) \).

The text then discusses estimating the error of this approximation using the Lagrange form of the remainder (error function), which considers the fourth derivative since it's a third-order polynomial:

\[ R_3(x) = \frac{f^{(4)}(c)(x - p)^4}{4!} \]

For \( f(x) = \ln(x) \):

- The third derivative is \( 2x^{-3} \).
- The fourth derivative is \( -6x^{-4} \).

The error bound for \( x = 1.03 \) is calculated using values of the fourth derivative between \( c = 1 \) and \( c = 1.03 \):

\[ R_3(1.03) < \frac{|f^{(4)}(c)|(0.03)^4}{24} \]

Calculating this with specific values:

- At \( c = 1 \), \( f^{(4)}(1) = -6 \).
- At \( c = 1.03 \), calculate \( f^{(4)}(1.03) \).

The error is bounded between these two calculations, providing an interval within which the true value of \( \ln(1.03) \) lies relative to the Taylor polynomial approximation. This method allows for understanding the potential deviation or error in using a third-order polynomial to estimate \( \ln(1.03) \).
