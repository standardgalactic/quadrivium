The text explains Taylor's theorem for approximating functions using a polynomial. The prerequisites are that \( f \) must have continuous derivatives up to order \( n+1 \) on a closed interval \([a, b]\), and be differentiable on the open interval \((a, b)\). For a function \( f \) at a point \( p \) within this interval, Taylor's theorem states that for every \( x \) in the open interval, there exists some value \( c \) between \( x \) and \( p \) such that:

\[ f(x) = T_n(x) + R_n(x), \]

where \( T_n(x) \) is the \( n \)-th order Taylor polynomial at \( p \), and \( R_n(x) \) is the remainder or error term. The Lagrange form of the remainder for the Taylor series expansion to the \( n \)-th degree is given by:

\[ R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x - p)^{n+1}. \]

The text uses an example involving approximating \( f(x) = \ln x \) around \( p = 1 \). It calculates the third-order Taylor polynomial:

\[ T_3(x) = f(p) + f'(p)(x-p) + \frac{f''(p)}{2!}(x-p)^2 + \frac{f'''(p)}{3!}(x-p)^3. \]

Calculating derivatives for \( f(x) = \ln x \):
- \( f(p) = \ln 1 = 0 \),
- \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} \Rightarrow f'(1) = 1 \),
- \( f''(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2} \Rightarrow f''(1) = -1 \),
- \( f'''(x) = \frac{2}{x^3} \Rightarrow f'''(1) = 2 \).

The third-order Taylor polynomial is:

\[ T_3(x) = (x-1) - \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} + \frac{2(x-1)^3}{6}. \]

This example illustrates how to choose a sensible point \( p \) and order of approximation based on the problem context, ensuring that calculations remain manageable.

The text describes the process of calculating a third-order Taylor polynomial for \( \ln(x) \) at \( p = 1 \), specifically aiming to approximate \( \ln(1.03) \). The polynomial derived is:

\[ x - 2 + \frac{3}{3} = x - 2 + 1 = x - 1 \]

The next step involves substituting \( x = 1.03 \) into the Taylor polynomial, resulting in:

\[ 0.03 - \frac{(0.03)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.03)^3}{6} \]

This provides an estimated value for \( \ln(1.03) \).

The text then discusses estimating the error of this approximation using the Lagrange form of the remainder (error function), which considers the fourth derivative since it's a third-order polynomial:

\[ R_3(x) = \frac{f^{(4)}(c)(x - p)^4}{4!} \]

For \( f(x) = \ln(x) \):

- The third derivative is \( 2x^{-3} \).
- The fourth derivative is \( -6x^{-4} \).

The error bound for \( x = 1.03 \) is calculated using values of the fourth derivative between \( c = 1 \) and \( c = 1.03 \):

\[ R_3(1.03) < \frac{|f^{(4)}(c)|(0.03)^4}{24} \]

Calculating this with specific values:

- At \( c = 1 \), \( f^{(4)}(1) = -6 \).
- At \( c = 1.03 \), calculate \( f^{(4)}(1.03) \).

The error is bounded between these two calculations, providing an interval within which the true value of \( \ln(1.03) \) lies relative to the Taylor polynomial approximation. This method allows for understanding the potential deviation or error in using a third-order polynomial to estimate \( \ln(1.03) \).

The text discusses Taylor's theorem and its application in approximating functions using Taylor polynomials. The prerequisites for applying Taylor's theorem include having a function \( f \) that is continuously differentiable up to order \( n \) on a closed interval \([a, b]\), with the point of expansion \( p \) lying within the open interval \((a, b)\). For any \( x \) in this interval, there exists some value \( c \) between \( x \) and \( p \) such that the function equals its Taylor polynomial plus an error term.

The text explains that while Taylor polynomials approximate a function near \( p \), there is an inherent error as one moves further away from \( p \). This error is quantified by the Lagrange form of the remainder, involving the \( (n+1) \)-th derivative evaluated at some point \( c \).

An example is provided using the natural logarithm function \( f(x) = \ln(x) \), with a Taylor polynomial centered at \( p = 1 \). The steps to construct this third-order Taylor polynomial are detailed:
- The zeroth derivative at \( x = 1 \) is 0.
- The first derivative, evaluated at \( x = 1 \), is 1.
- The second derivative, evaluated at \( x = 1 \), is -1.
- The third derivative, evaluated at \( x = 1 \), is 2.

Thus, the third-order Taylor polynomial for \( f(x) = \ln(x) \) around \( p = 1 \) is:
\[ T_3(x) = (x - 1) - \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)^2 + \frac{1}{3}(x - 1)^3. \]

The text emphasizes the importance of choosing a sensible order for the polynomial and centering point to balance accuracy with computational effort, especially in an exam setting.

The text describes the process of constructing a third-order Taylor polynomial for the natural logarithm function \( \ln(x) \) around \( p = 1 \), specifically applied to estimate \( \ln(1.03) \).

Here's a summary:

1. **Taylor Polynomial Construction:**
   - The third-order Taylor polynomial for \( \ln(x) \) at \( x = 1 \) is derived.
   - It simplifies to the expression \( (x-2) + \frac{3}{3} \), leading to \( x - 2 + 1 \).

2. **Substituting \( x = 1.03 \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 1.03 \) into the polynomial: 
     \[
     0.03 - \frac{(0.03)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.03)^3}{6}
     \]
   - This provides an approximation for \( \ln(1.03) \).

3. **Error Estimation Using Lagrange Form:**
   - The error in the Taylor polynomial approximation is analyzed using the Lagrange form of the remainder.
   - The fourth derivative of \( \ln(x) \) is calculated as \( -\frac{6}{x^4} \).
   - For \( c \) between 1 and 1.03, bounds for the error are determined:
     \[
     R_3(1.03) < \frac{s \cdot (0.03)^4}{24}
     \]
     where \( s \) is a value calculated using specific values of \( x \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The true value of \( \ln(1.03) \) lies within the error bounds derived from the polynomial approximation.
   - The text emphasizes that while the exact error depends on an unknown \( c \), it can be bounded effectively.

The process highlights both the construction and estimation phases in using Taylor polynomials for function approximations, along with understanding potential errors through the Lagrange remainder formula.
