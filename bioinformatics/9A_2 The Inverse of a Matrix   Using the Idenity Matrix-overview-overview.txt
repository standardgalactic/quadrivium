Here's a summary of the text describing the process for finding the inverse of a \(3 \times 3\) matrix using elementary row operations:

1. **Matrix Construction**: A system of linear equations is set up with variables \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \), forming matrix \( A \) and vector \( b \). The solutions are known: \( x_1 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 3 \), \( x_3 = 4 \).

2. **Augmented Matrix**: Matrix \( A \) is augmented with the identity matrix, creating a new matrix that allows for row operations to transform \( A \) into the identity matrix.

3. **Row Operations**:
   - The objective is to convert the left side of the augmented matrix (the original matrix \( A \)) into the identity matrix.
   - Row operations are systematically applied from top to bottom, and reversed as needed.
   - Leading coefficients in each row are converted to 1, while all other entries in their columns are made zero.

4. **Steps**:
   - The process begins by making the leading coefficient of the first row a 0 through row subtraction.
   - Other leading coefficients are converted to 1 by multiplying entire rows by appropriate scalars.
   - Any remaining non-zero entries above or below leading ones are eliminated.

5. **Result**: Once the left side of the augmented matrix is transformed into the identity matrix, the right side becomes the inverse of the original matrix \( A \).

The text also describes a step-by-step process for transforming a matrix into reduced row echelon form:

1. **Initial Steps**: The person works with fractions like \(-5/6\), \(2/3\), \(-1/2\), and \(1/3\). They perform row operations to achieve zeros in specific positions.

2. **Creating Leading Ones**: The goal is to have leading ones (1s) down the diagonal, with zeros beneath each:
   - Multiply a row by \(-6/5\) to turn \(-5/6\) into 1.
   - This affects other elements in the row, resulting in new values: 0, 0, 1, \(-4/5\), \(3/5\), \(-2/5\).

3. **Reverse Operations**: After achieving leading ones, they work backwards to ensure zeros above each leading one:
   - Multiply another row by \(5/2\) and add it to the first row.
   - This results in new values for the first row: 0, 1, 0, \(-1\), 1, \(-1\).

4. **Final Steps**: The matrix is close to reduced row echelon form:
   - First row: 0, 1, 0, \(-1\), 1, \(-1\)
   - Second row remains unchanged: 0, 0, 1, \(-4/5\), \(3/5\), \(-2/5\)

The process involves careful arithmetic to manipulate the matrix into the desired form.
