The text discusses solving a second-order linear differential equation using the reduction of order technique. Given that one solution, \( y_1 = e^x \), is known and defined over all real numbers, the task is to find another linearly independent solution to obtain the general solution.

The method involves assuming the second solution has the form \( y = u(x) y_1 = u(x)e^x \). By substituting this into the differential equation and using the product rule for differentiation, it leads to an equation in terms of derivatives of \( u \).

After differentiating twice and simplifying, the problem reduces to a first-order linear differential equation for \( u' \), which is solved by separation of variables. Integrating yields an expression involving an exponential function.

Finally, substituting back gives the general solution as \( y = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^x \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. The solutions \( e^x \) and \( e^{-x} \) are shown to be linearly independent, completing the general solution for the differential equation.

The text appears to be a snippet that starts with an expression of surprise or realization, "And lo and behold," followed by a statement indicating the point at which something was achieved or discovered: "That is where I got." This suggests a moment of reaching a conclusion or finding out important information. However, without additional context, it's unclear what specific event or discovery this refers to. The text seems to convey a sense of accomplishment or an unexpected outcome.
