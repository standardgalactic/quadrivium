The text discusses solving a second-order linear differential equation using the reduction of order technique. Given that one solution, \( y_1 = e^x \), is known and defined over all real numbers, the task is to find another linearly independent solution to obtain the general solution.

The method involves assuming the second solution has the form \( y = u(x) y_1 = u(x)e^x \). By substituting this into the differential equation and using the product rule for differentiation, it leads to an equation in terms of derivatives of \( u \).

After differentiating twice and simplifying, the problem reduces to a first-order linear differential equation for \( u' \), which is solved by separation of variables. Integrating yields an expression involving an exponential function.

Finally, substituting back gives the general solution as \( y = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^x \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. The solutions \( e^x \) and \( e^{-x} \) are shown to be linearly independent, completing the general solution for the differential equation.

The text appears to be a snippet that starts with an expression of surprise or realization, "And lo and behold," followed by a statement indicating the point at which something was achieved or discovered: "That is where I got." This suggests a moment of reaching a conclusion or finding out important information. However, without additional context, it's unclear what specific event or discovery this refers to. The text seems to convey a sense of accomplishment or an unexpected outcome.

The text describes solving a second-order linear differential equation using the method of reduction of order. The given equation has one known solution, \( y_1 = e^x \), and we seek another independent solution to form the general solution.

Here's a step-by-step summary:

1. **Identify Known Solution**: We know that \( y_1 = e^x \) is a solution.

2. **Reduction of Order**: To find a second, linearly independent solution, use the substitution \( y = u \cdot y_1 = u \cdot e^x \).

3. **Derivatives**:
   - First derivative: \( y' = u'e^x + ue^x \).
   - Second derivative: \( y'' = u''e^x + 2u'e^x + ue^x \).

4. **Substitute into Original Equation**: Substitute \( y'' \) and \( y \) back into the differential equation \( y'' - y = 0 \), leading to:
   \[
   u''e^x + 2u'e^x = 0
   \]
   Simplify by dividing through by \( e^x \):
   \[
   u'' + 2u' = 0
   \]

5. **Solve the First-Order Equation**: Let \( w = u' \), then \( w' + 2w = 0 \). This is a first-order linear differential equation.

6. **Separation of Variables**:
   - Rearrange: \( \frac{dw}{dx} = -2w \).
   - Integrate: \( \ln |w| = -2x + C_1 \).
   - Solve for \( w \): \( w = C_2 e^{-2x} \).

7. **Integrate to Find \( u \)**:
   - Since \( w = u' \), integrate \( u' = C_2 e^{-2x} \) to find \( u \):
   \[
   u = -\frac{1}{2}C_2 e^{-2x} + C_3
   \]

8. **Find General Solution for \( y \)**:
   - Substitute back: \( y = u \cdot e^x = \left(-\frac{1}{2}C_2 e^{-2x} + C_3\right) e^x \).
   - Simplify: 
     \[
     y = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 e^{x}
     \]
   where \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are constants.

9. **Conclusion**: The general solution is \( y = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 e^x \), which includes two linearly independent solutions, ensuring a complete solution set for the differential equation.

The text appears to be a brief excerpt, possibly from a song or poem. It conveys a sense of surprise or discovery with "And lo and behold," suggesting that the speaker has reached a particular place or realization ("That is where I got"). The snippet indicates an unexpected outcome or arrival at a significant moment but lacks additional context for further elaboration.
