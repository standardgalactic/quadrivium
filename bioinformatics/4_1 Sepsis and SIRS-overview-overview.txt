The text provides an overview of sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), focusing on their surgical implications. Sepsis is a severe infection-induced systemic inflammation, while SIRS can result from non-infectious causes like pancreatitis or trauma. Key definitions include:

- **Infection**: Invasion by organisms into sterile tissue.
- **Bacteremia**: Viable bacteria in the bloodstream.
- **SIRS**: Requires two or more symptoms such as abnormal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, or white blood cell count.
- **Sepsis**: Infection plus SIRS criteria and a positive culture or visible infection.
- **Severe sepsis**: Signs of sepsis with organ dysfunction indicators like low urine output or high lactate levels.
- **Septic shock**: Severe sepsis with persistent hypotension needing vasopressors.
- **Refractory septic shock**: Requires higher doses of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

Risk factors for severe infection include age over 65, immunosuppression, malnutrition, and community-acquired pneumonia. Genetic predispositions are under study as potential risks. Mortality rates have decreased with advanced care but remain between 20% and 50%.

Prognostic factors involve host response anomalies and comorbidities. The infection site (e.g., gastrointestinal or pulmonary) significantly impacts mortality, with certain pathogens posing greater risks.

The text emphasizes the critical role of timely intravenous antibiotics in treating sepsis:

1. **Timely Antibiotics**: Prompt administration decreases mortality.
2. **Integration with Initial Care**: Should be part of initial consultation and resuscitation (ABCs: Airway, Breathing, Circulation).
3. **Impact of Prior Antibiotics Use**: Recent antibiotic use increases mortality from gram-negative sepsis.
4. **Restoring Perfusion**: Quickly restoring perfusion is crucial for outcomes; delays may indicate severe sepsis with poor prognosis.

Overall, rapid intervention with antibiotics and fluid resuscitation is vital in improving sepsis outcomes. Understanding these definitions and risk factors is essential for managing sepsis and SIRS, particularly from a surgical perspective.
