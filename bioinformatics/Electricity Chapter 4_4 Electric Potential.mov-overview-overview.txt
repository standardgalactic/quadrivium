The text explains methods for calculating the electric potential due to two specific line charge configurations: a semicircular arc and a uniformly charged straight wire.

1. **Electric Potential from a Semicircular Line Charge:**
   - A semicircular arc with radius \( R \) has its electric potential at a point distance \( r \) away calculated using integration.
   - The differential charge element, \( dQ \), is related to the linear charge density (\(\lambda\)) and a small angle change \( d\theta \).
   - By integrating over the semicircular arc, it's shown that the potential at distance \( r \) resembles that of all charge concentrated at a point: \( V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} \), where \( q \) is the total charge on the arc.

2. **Electric Potential from a Uniformly Charged Straight Wire:**
   - For a straight wire of length \( L \), positioned with one end at \( x = 0 \), the potential at a point \( P \), located 1 meter away, is calculated.
   - The charge element along the wire is expressed as \( dq = \lambda dx \).
   - The distance from an element to point \( P \) is \( x + 1 \).
   - Integration over the wire's length results in a potential expression involving natural logarithms.

These examples illustrate how calculus, particularly integration, is used to determine electric potentials for different charge geometries.
