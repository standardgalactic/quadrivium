The task is to find the indefinite integral of \(x^2 \cos(x)\) with respect to \(x\). This requires using integration by parts, a technique similar to the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

where \(u\) and \(dv\) are chosen from the original integrand.

**Step 1:** Choose \(u\) and \(dv\).

For the integral \(\int x^2 \cos(x) \, dx\), we make two choices:
- Let \(u = x^2\), then \(du = 2x \, dx\).
- Let \(dv = \cos(x) \, dx\), then \(v = \sin(x)\).

**Step 2:** Apply the integration by parts formula.

Using the formula:

\[
\int x^2 \cos(x) \, dx = x^2 \sin(x) - \int \sin(x) \cdot 2x \, dx
\]

This results in a new integral: \(\int 2x \sin(x) \, dx\).

**Step 3:** Apply integration by parts again to the new integral.

For \(\int 2x \sin(x) \, dx\), choose:
- Let \(u = 2x\), then \(du = 2 \, dx\).
- Let \(dv = \sin(x) \, dx\), then \(v = -\cos(x)\).

Apply the formula:

\[
\int 2x \sin(x) \, dx = 2x(-\cos(x)) - \int (-\cos(x)) \cdot 2 \, dx
\]

Simplify:

\[
= -2x \cos(x) + 2 \int \cos(x) \, dx
\]

The integral \(\int \cos(x) \, dx\) is straightforward:

\[
= \sin(x)
\]

So:

\[
\int 2x \sin(x) \, dx = -2x \cos(x) + 2\sin(x)
\]

**Step 4:** Substitute back into the original integration by parts result.

Substitute \(\int 2x \sin(x) \, dx\) back:

\[
\int x^2 \cos(x) \, dx = x^2 \sin(x) - (-2x \cos(x) + 2\sin(x))
\]

Simplify:

\[
= x^2 \sin(x) + 2x \cos(x) - 2\sin(x) + C
\]

where \(C\) is the constant of integration. Thus, the indefinite integral of \(x^2 \cos(x)\) with respect to \(x\) is:

\[
x^2 \sin(x) + 2x \cos(x) - 2\sin(x) + C
\]

To find the indefinite integral of \(x^2 \cos(x)\) with respect to \(x\), we use integration by parts, which is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

For our function \(x^2 \cos(x)\), we choose:

- \(u = x^2\) (so \(du = 2x \, dx\))
- \(dv = \cos(x) \, dx\) (so \(v = \sin(x)\))

Applying integration by parts:

\[
\int x^2 \cos(x) \, dx = x^2 \sin(x) - \int \sin(x) \cdot 2x \, dx
\]

Now, we need to solve \(\int 2x \sin(x) \, dx\) using integration by parts again. Choose:

- \(u = 2x\) (so \(du = 2 \, dx\))
- \(dv = \sin(x) \, dx\) (so \(v = -\cos(x)\))

Applying integration by parts to this integral:

\[
\int 2x \sin(x) \, dx = 2x(-\cos(x)) - \int (-\cos(x)) \cdot 2 \, dx
\]

Simplifying:

\[
= -2x \cos(x) + 2 \int \cos(x) \, dx
\]

The integral of \(\cos(x)\) is \(\sin(x)\), so:

\[
= -2x \cos(x) + 2 \sin(x)
\]

Substitute back into the original expression:

\[
\int x^2 \cos(x) \, dx = x^2 \sin(x) - (-2x \cos(x) + 2 \sin(x))
\]

Simplifying gives:

\[
= x^2 \sin(x) + 2x \cos(x) - 2 \sin(x) + C
\]

where \(C\) is the constant of integration. Thus, the indefinite integral of \(x^2 \cos(x)\) with respect to \(x\) is:

\[
x^2 \sin(x) + 2x \cos(x) - 2 \sin(x) + C
\]
