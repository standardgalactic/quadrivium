The text underscores the importance of formulating hypotheses before collecting or analyzing data as part of ethical research practices. Researchers should establish two main research questions and set corresponding null and alternative hypotheses for comparing HbA1c levels at admission between patients with minor and major infections. The **null hypothesis** states there is no difference in HbA1c levels between the groups, while the **alternative hypothesis** suggests a difference without specifying which group might have higher or lower levels, constituting a two-tailed test.

The text cautions against altering hypotheses after data analysis to suit desired outcomes, such as changing from a two-tailed to a one-tailed test post hoc, labeling it unethical. Similar hypotheses are set for comparing CRP levels at admission between the same patient groups, also forming a two-tailed test.

It emphasizes pre-defining an alpha level (e.g., 0.05) to assess statistical significance, where a p-value below this threshold leads to rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, while a higher value results in failing to reject it. Researchers can only fail to reject the null; they cannot prove it.

The text concludes by mentioning upcoming discussions on research protocols and ethics, highlighting their critical role in research design and execution.
