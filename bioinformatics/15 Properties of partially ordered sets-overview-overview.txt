The text explains how a relation \( R \) can partially order a set by satisfying reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity. Reflexivity requires each element to relate to itself. Anti-symmetry ensures that if two elements mutually relate (\( aRb \) and \( bRa \)), they must be identical (\( a = b \)). Transitivity means if an element relates to another which in turn relates to a third, the first and third are also related.

A partial order does not have to be a total order because it is not necessary for every pair of elements to be comparable. The text illustrates this with the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 12\}\) using "divides" as the relation: in the subset \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), not all elements are comparable (e.g., 2 does not divide 3), showing a partial order. Conversely, in the subset \(\{1, 2, 4\}\), every element is comparable, which constitutes a total order.
