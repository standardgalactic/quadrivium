The text describes how to convert a given function \( x(t) \), expressed in terms of cosine and sine components, into an alternate form using a single sinusoidal expression. The original function is:

\[ x(t) = \frac{2}{3} \cos(\omega t) - \frac{1}{6} \sin(\omega t) \]

The goal is to rewrite it as:

\[ x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \]

**Steps for Conversion:**

1. **Calculate Amplitude \( A \):**
   The amplitude \( A \) is found using the formula:
   
   \[ A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} \]
   
   Substituting \( c_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( c_2 = -\frac{1}{6} \):
   
   \[
   A = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{6}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{9} + \frac{1}{36}} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{36} + \frac{1}{36}} = \sqrt{\frac{17}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{6}
   \]

2. **Determine Phase Angle \( \phi \):**
   To find \( \phi \), consider the relationship between the components and trigonometric identities:
   
   - The sine of \( \phi \) in a right triangle is given by:
     
     \[ \sin(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{A} = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{\sqrt{17}}{6}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}} \]

   - However, since \( c_2 \) is negative, the angle \( \phi \) is in the second quadrant. Therefore:
     
     \[ \pi - \phi = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}\right) \]
   
   - Solving for \( \phi \):
     
     \[ \phi = \pi - \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}\right) \]

3. **Final Expression:**
   The rewritten function is:
   
   \[ x(t) = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{6} \sin(\omega t + 1.816) \]
   
   This conversion involves careful consideration of the signs and quadrant of \( \phi \) based on the components \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). The positive x-axis is taken as the reference for \( \phi = 0 \), and adjustments are made if the vector lies in a different quadrant.

The text describes a process for rewriting an equation in the form \( x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \). Initially, you have an expression \( x(t) = \frac{2}{3} \cos(a t) - \frac{1}{6} \sin(a t) \), and you need to convert it into the alternate form.

To find amplitude \( A \):
- Use the formula \( A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} \).
- In this case, \( c_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( c_2 = -\frac{1}{6} \).
- Calculate: 
  \[
  A = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{6}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{9} + \frac{1}{36}} = \sqrt{\frac{17}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{6}.
  \]

To find the phase angle \( \phi \):
- Recognize that because \( c_2 \) is negative, the vector representation of the components (\( c_1 \), \( c_2 \)) is in the second quadrant.
- The sine of the angle \( \phi' \) (which is not yet \( \phi \)) is given by:
  \[
  \sin(\phi') = \frac{c_1}{A} = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{\sqrt{17}}{6}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}.
  \]
- Since the angle \( \phi' \) is in the second quadrant, the actual phase \( \phi \) is:
  \[
  \phi = \pi - \arcsin\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}\right).
  \]

Finally, substitute \( A \) and \( \phi \) back into the equation to get:
\[ 
x(t) = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{6} \sin(8t + 1.816).
\]

This conversion requires careful consideration of the signs of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), as well as the quadrant in which the angle lies, to correctly determine \( \phi \).
