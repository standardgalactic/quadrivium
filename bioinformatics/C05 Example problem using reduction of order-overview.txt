The text discusses solving a second-order linear differential equation by eliminating the constant coefficient in front of the derivative, reducing it to \( y'' - \frac{4}{3}y' + \frac{4}{9}y = 0 \). The solution approach involves finding two linearly independent solutions (\( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \)) where one is known: \( y_1 = e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \).

The method employed is reduction of order, assuming the general solution as a product form \( y = u(x) y_1 = u(x) e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \). Differentiating this expression involves applying the product and chain rules to find expressions for \( y' \) and \( y'' \). The goal is to substitute these derivatives back into the differential equation, which simplifies through algebraic manipulations. 

In reducing order, a substitution \( w = u' \) is made, leading to an auxiliary equation where solving for \( w \) shows it must be constant (denoted as "constant 2") due to the properties of exponential functions never equating zero. Integrating this result gives \( u(x) = c_2 x + c_1 \), forming a second solution: \( y_2 = x e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \).

The final general solution is thus \( y = c_1 e^{\frac{2x}{3}} + c_2 x e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \). The text emphasizes careful handling of derivatives and algebra to avoid common mistakes in such first-year calculus problems.

The text emphasizes the importance of double-checking mathematical work, particularly when working with derivatives. It highlights common areas where mistakes can occur, such as in calculating first and second derivatives using the product rule and chain rule. Additionally, it mentions "reduction of order" as a straightforward technique that should also be reviewed carefully to ensure accuracy. The speaker expresses a commitment to revisiting these concepts to avoid errors, with plans to continue this focus in future discussions.
