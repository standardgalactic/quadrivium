The text discusses solving a second-order linear differential equation by eliminating the constant coefficient in front of the derivative, reducing it to \( y'' - \frac{4}{3}y' + \frac{4}{9}y = 0 \). The solution approach involves finding two linearly independent solutions (\( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \)) where one is known: \( y_1 = e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \).

The method employed is reduction of order, assuming the general solution as a product form \( y = u(x) y_1 = u(x) e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \). Differentiating this expression involves applying the product and chain rules to find expressions for \( y' \) and \( y'' \). The goal is to substitute these derivatives back into the differential equation, which simplifies through algebraic manipulations. 

In reducing order, a substitution \( w = u' \) is made, leading to an auxiliary equation where solving for \( w \) shows it must be constant (denoted as "constant 2") due to the properties of exponential functions never equating zero. Integrating this result gives \( u(x) = c_2 x + c_1 \), forming a second solution: \( y_2 = x e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \).

The final general solution is thus \( y = c_1 e^{\frac{2x}{3}} + c_2 x e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \). The text emphasizes careful handling of derivatives and algebra to avoid common mistakes in such first-year calculus problems.

The text emphasizes the importance of double-checking mathematical work, particularly when working with derivatives. It highlights common areas where mistakes can occur, such as in calculating first and second derivatives using the product rule and chain rule. Additionally, it mentions "reduction of order" as a straightforward technique that should also be reviewed carefully to ensure accuracy. The speaker expresses a commitment to revisiting these concepts to avoid errors, with plans to continue this focus in future discussions.

The text provides a step-by-step solution for solving a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation of the form \( y'' - \frac{12}{9}y' + \frac{4}{9}y = 0 \). Initially, it simplifies to \( y'' - \frac{4}{3}y' + \frac{4}{9}y = 0 \).

The process involves using a substitution method because the equation is second-order. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions: \( y = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 \). Given one solution, \( y_1 = e^{\frac{2}{3}x} \), the approach uses this to find another solution using reduction of order.

The substitution is made by setting \( y = u(x) y_1 \), and differentiation yields expressions for \( y' \) and \( y'' \). These are substituted back into the original differential equation. The process involves applying both the product rule and chain rule in calculus to derive these derivatives.

During substitution, terms cancel out due to algebraic manipulation, leading to an auxiliary first-order differential equation involving \( w = \frac{du}{dx} \). Solving this gives that \( w \) is a constant, implying \( u(x) \) itself is linear: \( u(x) = c_2 x + c_1 \).

Finally, the general solution for \( y \) is derived as:

\[ y = c_1 e^{\frac{2}{3}x} + c_2 x e^{\frac{2}{3}x}, \]

where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants determined by initial conditions or boundary values. The lesson emphasizes careful application of derivatives, highlighting a common error in handling product and chain rules.

The text emphasizes the importance of careful checking when working with derivatives, particularly focusing on the first and second derivatives as well as using the product rule and chain rule. It advises always verifying calculations to avoid mistakes in these areas. The mention of "reduction of order" refers to a straightforward technique that should be double-checked for accuracy. The speaker plans to revisit this topic later, indicating an ongoing process or series of discussions related to calculus concepts.
