Let's look at a problem here
where we have a convex mirror
so our mirror is convex
and in front of it we put an object
which is 0.060 meters high
and about 6 centimeters
Let's call the radius of the mirror is 0.40 meters
and we put it in front of the mirror at a distance of 0.30 meters
Now let's look at the situation
in other words if we had to draw it out
we'd have our center line
this is a convex mirror
in other words its center point
out here at 0.4 centimeters
and we'll have a focal point there
and we're putting it out
so this is not to scale
this is 6 centimeters high
and 0.3 centimeters in front of the mirror
Now remember what we said
first of all let's just look at the signs
it is an upright image
the radius is positive because this is a convex mirror
remember R is positive for convex mirror
in the setup of our equations
and it is at a distance 0.3
now remember from the first few videos
we said that these images will be erect
they will be and they will be virtual
in other words you can't put an image sensor there
to capture that image
the equations that we are going to deal with
the same as we had done before
negative 2 over R
which is going to be 1 over the focal distance
1 over the focal distance
we need the distance to the image there
so we were going to be left with 1 over
the distance to the image
is going to be 2 over R
plus 1 over S is 0
which is going to be negative
R S is 0
we're going to have 2 S is 0 plus R
this negative outside
compensates for the fact that this has to be negative
and that has to be negative
now indeed we need S on its own
so numerator and denominator
so on this side we're going to simply have R S is 0
divided by 2 S is 0 plus R
that is going to be a negative
R times S is 0
open 4 times open 3
is going to be
open 1, 2 square meters
and 2 times S is 0
2 times 0.3 is 0.6
plus 0.4 is 1.0 meters
so we are left with a negative 0.12 meters
indeed that image
because it's negative means it's a virtual image
the second equation that we do need to know
is that our magnification remember was a negative
the distance to the image divided by the distance to the object
equals
the height of the image
divided by the height of the object
there
we need the height of the image
so YI is going to equal negative SI Y0
divided by S0
so that was going to be a negative
times 0.12 meters
yes
times Y
which is 0.060 meters
divided by
that was a negative in there
apologies for that
and then S0 was 0.30 meters
negative times the negative is positive
and indeed
as we said our image is going to be erect
and I get for this
I get 2.4 centimeters
upright
so it's erect
and it's virtual
and let's look at that
why would that be so
I can draw my rays
remember the four types of rays I can draw
let's draw one that is parallel to the central axis
that will go down to
it doesn't go through the mirror
but it helps us just draw the line of reflection there
and then if I had another line go straight to
the center point
which at least
at least from there to there
from there to there
is a radius
of the circle
so we'll just go back
and there where those lines meet
I will have my virtual image
as we can see
it is virtual
it is erect
and it is diminished
and indeed it is diminished
in this problem we want to know
where should we place an object
with reference to a concave mirror
a concave mirror of a radius
180 centimeters
so our radius
it is a concave mirror
so it's going to be
1.80 meters
180 centimeters
to form a real image
that is half the size of the object
a real image
that is half the size
now a real image
for a concave mirror
means that it will have to be inverted
in other words
we are going to have the fact that
m equals negative a half
m equals negative a half
so let's have a look at these
we know that
1 over S0
is 1 over Si
equals negative 2 over R
we know what R is
but we certainly don't know
what S0 and Si is
but we do know that
m equals
negative Si over S0
so let's have a look at that
that means
Si is going to be
negative m
S0
that's going to be negative
m is negative 1 over 2
S0
in other words
a half
half S0
or S0 over 2
in other words
1 over S0
plus 1 over
Si
I now know as S0
divided by 2
equals negative 2 over R
2 over R
so I am going to have 1 over S0
plus
this can go into the numerator
2 over S0
equals negative 2 over R
or 3 over S0
equals negative 2 over R
I want S0 on its own
that is going to leave me
with negative 3 R divided by 2
that will be negative 3 R
R was negative 1.80 meters
divided by 2
and that is going to give me
2.7 meters
so I need to place a 2.7 meters
in front of the mirror
the most important thing here to have known
was that negative
that negative up there
that it is a concave mirror
let's see it was a concave mirror
and on the central line
if I placed it
I have to place it at 2.7 meters
which is outside obviously of the radius
the radius is 1.8 meter
I have to place it
and any image that we place here
will be real
but inverted
it will be real but inverted
in this problem
we are told
that an object
is in front of a concave mirror
with a radius of 120 cm
so R has got to equal negative 1.20 meters
and we want to know
where must this object be placed
to see an image
that is erect
and 4 times as large
it is erect
and 4 times as large
now remember
for a concave mirror
for something to be erect
it has got to be closer than
it has got to be closer than
the focal point
but if it is erect
it means its magnification
has got to be positive
because the object is erect
and the image is erect too
and that gives us our 4 there
let's look at the equations
we know that M equals negative Si over S0
and we know that 1 over S0 plus 1 over Si is going to equal negative 2 over R
now we want to know where to place this
so indeed we need S0
so let's try and get rid of this Si
we have another equation there
which we through algebra can change to Si
equals negative M S0
is going to be negative a 4 times S0
so I have 1 over S0
minus 1 over S0
that's negative 4 is 0 for Si
equals negative 2 over R
I can take out 1 over S0
as a common factor
so I left with 1 minus a quarter
equals negative 2 over R
I can take a 0 up to the denominator
numerator on the other side
that means this R can come up here
1 minus a quarter is 3 quarters
divided by this negative 2
so that's negative M2
in other words I have negative
what is R
that's negative 1.2 meters
times 3 quarters divided by 2
and that gives me an S0
if I substitute that
at 0.45 meters
or 54 centimeters
and we can indeed see
that the focal point will be
half of this
so the focal point is at 60 centimeters
and indeed I'm closer than that 60 centimeters
so I will get an enlarged
erect image
and remember it will be a virtual image
that's 100's
and the depth of this
that's the focal point
that's negative 3
that's negative 4
but that's negative 5
and then insight into that
where are changing
and digging
at thealle on the left
and now begins
and now that compartments
what happens
is that sorrow side
isation
electrically
and careful
because now
