Here's a concise summary of the text:

To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-1}^{1} (x + 2)^2 \, dx\), we reverse the limits from \([-1, 1]\) to \([1, -1]\), introducing a negative sign. We expand the integrand as \(x^2 + 4x + 4\) and find its antiderivatives: \(\frac{1}{3}x^3\), \(2x^2\), and \(4x\). Evaluating from 1 to -1, we substitute into the antiderivative expression:

- At \(x = 1\): \(\frac{1}{3}(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 4(1) = \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 4\).
- At \(x = -1\): \(-\left(\frac{1}{3}(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1)\right) = -\left(-\frac{1}{3} + 2 - 4\right)\).

The final result, after simplifying the difference, is \(-\frac{26}{3}\). Thus, the integral evaluates to \(-\frac{26}{3}\).
