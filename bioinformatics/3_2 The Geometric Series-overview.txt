You've provided a detailed explanation about the behavior of geometric series and how to determine their convergence or divergence. Let's break down the key points:

### Geometric Series

A geometric series has the form:

\[ S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots \]

where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.

#### Convergence Criteria

1. **Convergent**: A geometric series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio \( |r| < 1 \). The sum of an infinite convergent geometric series is given by:

   \[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]

2. **Divergent**: If \( |r| \geq 1 \), the series diverges.

### Example Analysis

You provided an example where you have a geometric series with terms involving powers of \( \left(\frac{8}{3}\right) \). Let's analyze it:

- The first term \( a = 5 \).
- The common ratio \( r = \frac{8}{3} \).

Since \( |r| = \left|\frac{8}{3}\right| > 1 \), the series diverges.

### nth Term Test for Divergence

The nth term test is a quick way to check if a series diverges:

- If the limit of the sequence's terms as \( n \to \infty \) is not zero, i.e.,

  \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0 \]

  then the series diverges.

In your example, considering the term:

\[ a_n = 5 \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^n \]

As \( n \to \infty \), \( a_n \) grows without bound (since \( \left|\frac{8}{3}\right| > 1 \)), confirming divergence.

### Conclusion

The geometric series you provided diverges because the common ratio's absolute value is greater than one. The nth term test further supports this conclusion, as the terms do not approach zero. This method is efficient for quickly identifying divergence in cases where the series' behavior at infinity can be easily analyzed.

The discussion you provided revolves around analyzing the convergence or divergence of a geometric series. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Geometric Series Basics**:
   - A geometric series has terms in the form \( ar^n \), where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.
   - The sum of an infinite geometric series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio \( |r| < 1 \). If \( |r| \geq 1 \), the series diverges.

2. **Convergence Criteria**:
   - For convergence, you use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series: 
     \[
     S = \frac{a}{1-r}
     \]
   - This formula is valid only when \( |r| < 1 \).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - In your example, the series is given as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 5 \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^k
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 5 \) and \( r = \frac{8}{3} \).
   - Since \( |r| = \frac{8}{3} > 1 \), the series diverges.

4. **nth-Term Test for Divergence**:
   - This test states that if the limit of the sequence's terms as \( n \to \infty \) is not zero, then the series diverges.
   - For your example:
     \[
     \lim_{k \to \infty} 5 \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^k = \infty
     \]
   - Since this limit is not zero (it's infinity), the series diverges.

In summary, the geometric series in question diverges because the common ratio \( r = \frac{8}{3} \) has an absolute value greater than 1. Additionally, using the nth-term test for divergence confirms this result since the terms do not approach zero as \( k \to \infty \).
