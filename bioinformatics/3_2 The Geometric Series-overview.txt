You've provided a detailed explanation about the behavior of geometric series and how to determine their convergence or divergence. Let's break down the key points:

### Geometric Series

A geometric series has the form:

\[ S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots \]

where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.

#### Convergence Criteria

1. **Convergent**: A geometric series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio \( |r| < 1 \). The sum of an infinite convergent geometric series is given by:

   \[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]

2. **Divergent**: If \( |r| \geq 1 \), the series diverges.

### Example Analysis

You provided an example where you have a geometric series with terms involving powers of \( \left(\frac{8}{3}\right) \). Let's analyze it:

- The first term \( a = 5 \).
- The common ratio \( r = \frac{8}{3} \).

Since \( |r| = \left|\frac{8}{3}\right| > 1 \), the series diverges.

### nth Term Test for Divergence

The nth term test is a quick way to check if a series diverges:

- If the limit of the sequence's terms as \( n \to \infty \) is not zero, i.e.,

  \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0 \]

  then the series diverges.

In your example, considering the term:

\[ a_n = 5 \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^n \]

As \( n \to \infty \), \( a_n \) grows without bound (since \( \left|\frac{8}{3}\right| > 1 \)), confirming divergence.

### Conclusion

The geometric series you provided diverges because the common ratio's absolute value is greater than one. The nth term test further supports this conclusion, as the terms do not approach zero. This method is efficient for quickly identifying divergence in cases where the series' behavior at infinity can be easily analyzed.
