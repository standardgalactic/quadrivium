Let's look at some of the properties of logarithms.
We'll look at multiplication, division, power and then a special case of 1.
First, multiplication. An example of that would be if I have the log a of b times c.
And that can be rewritten as the log a of b plus the log a of c.
So I can just do an addition if I separate the b multiplied by c.
Let's look at division. If I have the log of a of b divided by c.
That would be the same as the log of a, log a of b minus the log a of c.
Let's look at a power. If I have the log a of b to the power c.
I can bring that power down and that becomes c log a of b.
Lastly, there's the special case of 1. If I have the log x of x, that would be 1.
Because it's asking x to the power what will give me x?
Well, x to the power 1 is x.
So these are four properties that you should know.
