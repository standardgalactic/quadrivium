The text provides an overview of gallstones, their commonality, symptoms, diagnosis, and management. Gallstones often don't cause symptoms (asymptomatic) but can lead to biliary colic or gallbladder attacks characterized by severe right-sided upper abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting after a fatty meal. Such attacks typically last for half an hour to several hours and might recur frequently.

Diagnosis involves ultrasound imaging to confirm the presence of gallstones, possibly accompanied by blood tests to check for related complications like liver disease or pancreatitis. Treatment options include analgesia for immediate relief and fluids if nausea and vomiting are severe.

The underlying mechanism involves a stone blocking bile flow in the cystic duct after a fatty meal triggers gallbladder contraction, causing pain until the stone moves back into the gallbladder. Due to high recurrence risk, cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) is often recommended as it poses fewer risks than potential complications from untreated gallstones.

Alternatives like dissolution therapy or lithotripsy are generally ineffective and not routinely used. It's important for patients with persistent pain to seek medical advice as this could indicate more serious conditions like cholecystitis (inflamed gallbladder).
