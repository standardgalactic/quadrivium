The text discusses exact differential equations, which are expressions of the form \( m(x, y) \, dx + n(x, y) \, dy \). For such an expression to be considered "exact" within a region \( r \) in the \( xy \)-plane, it must correspond to a multivariable function \( f(x, y) \) defined in that region. This requires the partial derivative of \( m \) with respect to \( y \) to equal the partial derivative of \( n \) with respect to \( x \), and both functions \( m \) and \( n \), along with their first partial derivatives, must be continuous within this region.

Understanding exact differentials involves concepts from multivariable calculus. In simpler terms, if a function \( f(x, y) \) has partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) as \( m \) and with respect to \( y \) as \( n \), then the differential equation \( m \, dx + n \, dy = 0 \) is exact if these conditions are met.

An example given is \( dz = y \, dx + x \, dy \). The text suggests that working through examples can help clarify the concept and emphasizes the benefit of having a background in multivariable calculus for a full understanding.
