The text is about solving a system of differential equations using algebraic techniques, specifically by finding eigenvalues.

Initially, you have a system defined by two equations:

\[ x' = x + 3y \]
\[ y' = 5x + 3y \]

To solve this, we aim to express the system in matrix form and find its eigenvalues. The general solution for such systems is given by \( \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{k} e^{\lambda t} \), where \(\mathbf{k}\) is a vector of constants, \(\lambda\) are the eigenvalues, and \(t\) represents time.

The system can be expressed in matrix form as:

\[ \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 5 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} \]

Denote the matrix by \(A\):

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 5 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

To find eigenvalues (\(\lambda\)), solve the characteristic equation:

\[ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. So, you compute:

\[ A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 1-\lambda & 3 \\ 5 & 3-\lambda \end{bmatrix} \]

The determinant of this matrix is:

\[ (1-\lambda)(3-\lambda) - (15) = \lambda^2 - 4\lambda - 12 \]

Setting the determinant to zero gives the characteristic equation:

\[ \lambda^2 - 4\lambda - 12 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation, you find the eigenvalues:

\[ (\lambda - 6)(\lambda + 2) = 0 \]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 6\) and \(\lambda_2 = -2\).

These eigenvalues (\(6\) and \(-2\)) are crucial as they determine the behavior of solutions to the differential system.
