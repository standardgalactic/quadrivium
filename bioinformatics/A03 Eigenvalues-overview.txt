The text is about solving a system of differential equations using algebraic techniques, specifically by finding eigenvalues.

Initially, you have a system defined by two equations:

\[ x' = x + 3y \]
\[ y' = 5x + 3y \]

To solve this, we aim to express the system in matrix form and find its eigenvalues. The general solution for such systems is given by \( \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{k} e^{\lambda t} \), where \(\mathbf{k}\) is a vector of constants, \(\lambda\) are the eigenvalues, and \(t\) represents time.

The system can be expressed in matrix form as:

\[ \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 5 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} \]

Denote the matrix by \(A\):

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 5 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

To find eigenvalues (\(\lambda\)), solve the characteristic equation:

\[ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. So, you compute:

\[ A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 1-\lambda & 3 \\ 5 & 3-\lambda \end{bmatrix} \]

The determinant of this matrix is:

\[ (1-\lambda)(3-\lambda) - (15) = \lambda^2 - 4\lambda - 12 \]

Setting the determinant to zero gives the characteristic equation:

\[ \lambda^2 - 4\lambda - 12 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation, you find the eigenvalues:

\[ (\lambda - 6)(\lambda + 2) = 0 \]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 6\) and \(\lambda_2 = -2\).

These eigenvalues (\(6\) and \(-2\)) are crucial as they determine the behavior of solutions to the differential system.

The text discusses solving a system of linear differential equations given by \( x' = ax \), where \( a \) is a matrix and \( x \) is a vector function of time. Specifically, it considers:

\[ 
x' = x + 3y 
\]
\[ 
y' = 5x + 3y 
\]

To solve this, the text suggests using eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The process involves expressing the solutions as \( \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{k} e^{\lambda t} \), where \( \mathbf{k} \) is a constant vector, and \( \lambda \) represents an eigenvalue of matrix \( a \). 

By substituting this expression into the differential equation, we derive that:

\[ 
\lambda \mathbf{k} = a\mathbf{k}
\]

This leads to finding the characteristic equation by setting up:

\[ 
(a - \lambda I)\mathbf{k} = 0
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of \( (a - \lambda I) \) must be zero. The matrix \( a \) in this case is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 \\
5 & 3 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The characteristic equation becomes:

\[ 
\text{det} \left( \begin{bmatrix} 1-\lambda & 3 \\ 5 & 3-\lambda \end{bmatrix} \right) = (1-\lambda)(3-\lambda) - 15 = 0
\]

Solving this results in:

\[ 
\lambda^2 - 4\lambda - 12 = 0
\]

Factoring gives the eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 = 6 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 2 \). These eigenvalues are crucial for finding the general solution of the system.
