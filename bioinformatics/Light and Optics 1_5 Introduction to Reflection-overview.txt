The text discusses the behavior of images formed by concave and convex mirrors as an object moves from beyond the center point towards the focal point.

For a **convex mirror**:
- The center point is at 1 meter, and the focal point is at 0.5 meters.
- As an object moves closer to the mirror (from beyond the center point, through the center point, to near the focal point), the image formed by the convex mirror remains upright and virtual.
- When the object is far away, the image is small and inverted.
- As the object approaches the focal point, the image becomes larger and eventually appears at infinity.

For a **concave mirror**:
- The text initially discusses placing an object beyond the center point (4 meters), where the image formed is real and smaller.
- As the object moves closer to the central point (1 meter), the image moves further away.
- At the focal point, the image theoretically forms at infinity.
- Moving just past the focal point results in a virtual, upright image that appears on the same side as the object.

The text also provides an example problem:
- To achieve a magnification of 1/5 with an object placed 0.15 meters from the mirror, we need a convex mirror.
- The calculations show that the radius of curvature for this mirror must be 7.5 centimeters (0.075 meters), confirming it as a convex mirror since the radius is positive.

Overall, the text explains how image characteristics change with object position relative to concave and convex mirrors, using specific distances and magnification examples.

The text explains how images form in convex and concave mirrors when an object moves relative to the focal point, center of curvature, and beyond these points. For a convex mirror with its center 1 meter away and a focal length of 0.5 meters:

- When an object is placed well beyond the central point (4 meters), it produces a smaller, real, and upright image at 0.57 meters from the mirror.
- As the object moves closer to the mirror:
  - The image size increases and appears further away until reaching the center of curvature, where the object and image are equal in size but inverted.
  - Approaching the focal point (0.5 meters), the image distance approaches infinity and becomes virtual and upright.

For a concave mirror:

- When an object is placed far from the mirror:
  - It produces a smaller, real, and inverted image.
  - As the object moves closer to the mirror, the inverted image enlarges until reaching the center of curvature where they are equal in size.
  - Approaching the focal point, the image size tends towards infinity.
  - Moving just past the focal point results in a virtual, upright image that decreases in size as it approaches the mirror.

To achieve a magnification of \( \frac{1}{5} \) for an object placed 0.15 meters from a spherical mirror:

- The required mirror is convex (as determined by calculations showing a positive radius).
- Using the mirror equation and magnification formula, the radius of curvature is calculated to be 7.5 cm. This ensures that the image formed will be virtual, upright, and smaller than the object.
