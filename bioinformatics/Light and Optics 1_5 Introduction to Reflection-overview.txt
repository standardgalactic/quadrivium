The text discusses the behavior of images formed by concave and convex mirrors as an object moves from beyond the center point towards the focal point.

For a **convex mirror**:
- The center point is at 1 meter, and the focal point is at 0.5 meters.
- As an object moves closer to the mirror (from beyond the center point, through the center point, to near the focal point), the image formed by the convex mirror remains upright and virtual.
- When the object is far away, the image is small and inverted.
- As the object approaches the focal point, the image becomes larger and eventually appears at infinity.

For a **concave mirror**:
- The text initially discusses placing an object beyond the center point (4 meters), where the image formed is real and smaller.
- As the object moves closer to the central point (1 meter), the image moves further away.
- At the focal point, the image theoretically forms at infinity.
- Moving just past the focal point results in a virtual, upright image that appears on the same side as the object.

The text also provides an example problem:
- To achieve a magnification of 1/5 with an object placed 0.15 meters from the mirror, we need a convex mirror.
- The calculations show that the radius of curvature for this mirror must be 7.5 centimeters (0.075 meters), confirming it as a convex mirror since the radius is positive.

Overall, the text explains how image characteristics change with object position relative to concave and convex mirrors, using specific distances and magnification examples.
