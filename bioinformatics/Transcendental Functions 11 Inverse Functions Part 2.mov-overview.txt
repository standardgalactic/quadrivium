To find the inverse of the function \( y = x^2 \), we need to address its domain because the original function is not one-to-one over all real numbers. Over the entire real line, \( y = x^2 \) fails the horizontal line test since each positive \( y \)-value corresponds to two different \( x \)-values (one positive and one negative). 

To make it a one-to-one function, we restrict the domain to non-negative values of \( x \), specifically from 0 to positive infinity (\( [0, \infty) \)). With this restriction, each \( y \)-value corresponds to exactly one \( x \)-value.

1. Start with \( y = x^2 \).
2. Solve for \( x \): Take the square root of both sides to get \( x = \sqrt{y} \).
3. Swap \( x \) and \( y \) to find the inverse: \( y = \sqrt{x} \).

Thus, the inverse function is \( y = \sqrt{x} \), valid for \( x \geq 0 \). Without this domain restriction, the original function does not have an inverse because it's not one-to-one. By limiting \( x \) to non-negative values, we ensure that the function and its inverse are both well-defined.
