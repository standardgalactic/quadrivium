### Summary:

**Intra-abdominal Infections: Prevention and Management**

- **Prevention Factors:**
  - **Balance:** Maintaining a balance between bacteria, host defenses, and environmental factors is crucial. Disruptions can lead to infections.
  - **Bacteria:** Common infectious agents include E. coli and Bacteroides fragilis, with infections often being polymicrobial.
  - **Host Defenses:** Involves soluble factors like complement and antibodies, as well as cellular defenses such as monocytes and macrophages.
  - **Environmental Factors:** Intact skin, mucosal surfaces, and gastrointestinal tract are essential to prevent infections.

- **Pathogenesis:**
  - Infections can be local (e.g., abscesses) or diffuse (e.g., peritonitis).
  - Bacteria access the bloodstream quickly through diaphragmatic lymphatic channels.
  - Development requires specific inoculation numbers, virulence, and compromised defenses/environmental conditions.

- **Virulence Factors:**
  - Presence of blood, bile, chyle, foreign bodies, gastric mucins, pancreatic secretions, or urine increases infection risk.
  - Abscesses create environments that reduce antibiotic effectiveness due to low pH, low oxygen tension, high bacterial load, and proteolytic enzymes.

- **Antibiotic Prophylaxis:**
  - Common antibiotics include Kefazolin, Kefoxetan, and Vancomycin.
  - Timing and dosage are crucial, with emphasis on discontinuing vancomycin within 24 hours post-surgery to prevent resistance.

**Surgical Considerations:**

- Maintain normothermia, adequate volume resuscitation, and supplemental oxygen to reduce infection risk.
- Avoid bowel preparation for most colonic surgeries due to risks like anastomotic dehiscence.
- Drains are generally unnecessary for certain surgeries; understanding drainage dynamics is recommended.
- Delayed wound closure can decrease infection rates in contaminated wounds.

**Peritonitis Management:**

- Primary peritonitis often managed with antimicrobials alone.
- Secondary peritonitis requires intervention such as percutaneous or surgical methods.
- Tertiary peritonitis involves ICU patients and may involve fungi.
- Early antibiotic administration is crucial, tailored to surgery site and patient comorbidities.

**Specific Conditions:**

1. **Appendicitis:**
   - Conservative treatment without antibiotics considered in some cases.
   - Laparoscopic surgery preferred for shorter hospital stays; antibiotics needed post-surgery based on complications.

2. **Acute Cholecystitis:**
   - Antibiotics administered before gallbladder removal due to bacterial contamination risks.
   - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is standard, with uncomplicated cases requiring antibiotics only for 24 hours.

3. **Acute Diverticulitis:**
   - Trend towards conservative management unless complications arise.
   - Options include antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, or laparoscopic lavage.

4. **Trauma:**
   - Management depends on injury specifics and time elapsed since the incident.

**Antibiotic Therapy Post-Surgery:**

- Evaluate extent of abdominal involvement, contamination levels, and source control achieved during surgery.
- Avoid prolonged antibiotic use beyond 24 hours in straightforward cases to prevent resistance.
- Consider pharmacokinetic changes due to fluid shifts, requiring adjusted dosing.
