The text demonstrates the application of the Mean Value Theorem for integrals using the function \( f(x) = 4 - x \) over the interval from 0 to 4. It outlines two main steps: calculating the average value and identifying where this average occurs within the interval.

1. **Average Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Average value} = \frac{\int_0^4 (4-x) \, dx}{4-0}
     \]
   - To find the definite integral from 0 to 4:
     - The antiderivative of \( f(x) = 4 - x \) is \( 4x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 \).
     - Evaluating at the bounds gives:
       \[
       [4(4) - \frac{1}{2}(4)^2] - [4(0) - \frac{1}{2}(0)^2] = 16 - 8 = 8
       \]
   - The average value is then calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Average value} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
     \]

2. **Finding Where Average Value Occurs:**
   - To find where this average value occurs, solve \( f(x) = 2 \):
     \[
     4 - x = 2 \implies x = 2
     \]
   - Thus, the function achieves its average value at \( x = 2 \).

3. **Verification with Area:**
   - The total area under the curve from 0 to 4 is confirmed as 8.
   - A rectangle representing this average value has height 2 and width 4, confirming the area as \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

This example demonstrates how the Mean Value Theorem for integrals connects a function's average value over an interval to specific points on the function within that interval.
