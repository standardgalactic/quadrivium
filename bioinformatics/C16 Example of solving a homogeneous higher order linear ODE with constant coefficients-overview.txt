The text discusses solving a linear, homogeneous third-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The solution involves using an auxiliary equation, which is expressed as \( m^3 + 3m^2 + 3m + 1 = 0 \). This can be recognized as \((m+1)^3 = 0\) through binomial expansion, leading to a triple root at \( m_1 = m_2 = m_3 = -1 \). Consequently, the general solution is given by:

\[ y(x) = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 x e^{-x} + c_3 x^2 e^{-x}, \]

where \( c_1 \), \( c_2 \), and \( c_3 \) are constants determined by initial conditions or boundary values.
