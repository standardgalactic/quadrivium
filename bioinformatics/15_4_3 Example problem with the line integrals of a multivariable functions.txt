Now let's have a look at this problem.
So we asked to evaluate the line integral of this function
only with respect to
this direction x. Where the curve C is the union
of two piecewise smooth curves as shown. So we have
C1, curve 1 and curve 2 there.
Now first let's work out
functions, vector functions for these two curves.
It certainly looks like on the x axis here
we are stuck at an x value of 0. And these
two lines are all at a value where x equals
well certainly 2 is where x
equals 0. We go from 0 to 0. So let's
start with C1 now. Let's have a, let's go
C1. So we have some, that's the arrow there
so it goes in this direction. So we have some
initial and some final point.
So let's have the final point
minus the initial point.
And that is going to be 0 minus 2
which is a negative 2.
1 minus 0 which is a 1.
And 0 minus 2 which is a negative 2.
In other words, if we were to construct this
vector r sub 1.
Because we're dealing with 1.
That'll be some function
x, y and z.
This vector function.
So that is going to be our starting point
which is there. 2 plus 0 plus 2
plus t of this.
9 minus 2, 1 and minus 2.
So that leaves us with an x value is
2 minus 2t.
Now y value of 0 plus t.
So that's this t.
And what happens to 0?
It goes from 0 to 1.
So t goes from 0 to 1.
And then z equals 2 minus 2t as well.
And all t is an element going from
this domain going from 0 to 1.
Now this is just in a certain direction.
So certainly later on we are going to need
the x prime of t which is going to be a negative 2.
We'll need the y prime of t which is 1.
And the z prime of t which is negative 2.
Our function of x, y and z there is 3x plus 2y plus z.
So if we get this function as far as our new vector is concerned
we're going to have 3 times 2 minus 2t.
We're going to have 2 times y is this t.
Plus we're going to have 2 minus 2t.
That's going to leave us with 6 minus 6t.
Plus 2t plus 2 minus 2t.
So that leaves us with...
Let's have a look.
Negative 6t.
That's a negative 6t.
Plus 8 it seems.
Plus 8.
So let's remind ourselves of what we require.
That's going to be a definite integral of some function...
The integral over some line of a function of a vector
in some direction is going to be parametrized from some initial t value
to some final t value.
Just choosing t as our new parameter of the f of a vector function in that same parameter
times x prime of t dt.
And that'll be x sub i.
By that I mean x prime t, y prime t, z prime t.
Again we can just mark it.
That's the one we've got to work from.
Let's carry on on the new page.
So, maybe I should try and put that there.
So what we're trying to work from is all of this.
We know that t goes from 0 to 1.
0 to 1.
f of the r of t.
We've got it there.
Negative 6t plus 8.
And x prime of t.
Well, we've got x prime of t there.
It's negative 2.
So that'll be a minus 2 dt.
So that equals the definite integral going from 0 to 2.
I suppose we can bring that out, but let's do that.
So it's 12t minus 16 dt.
That is going to leave us 6t squared minus 16t going from 0 to 1.
And that equals 6 minus 16.
And that equals negative 10.
So that is as far as our curve C1 was concerned.
Now let's parametrize this.
Now we have seen that this looks like it is just a quarter of the circle.
at x equals 0.
So if we just look at curve C2.
It looks like we're going as far as x, y and z is concerned.
We're just going from 0.
0 to 0.
So x remains that.
And then 1 to y equals 0 and z equals 0 to 1.
And we have seen previously if you have a circle and you're going in an anti-clockwise direction.
That's cosine of t, sine of t.
And then t being an element, what is it going to be?
Let me go on to a new line.
Well it's just a quarter of a circle.
So that's going to be 0 to pi over 2.
0 to pi over 2.
So it was simple to reconstruct that.
So let's do the same here.
So for curve C2, we're going to have the fact that x equals 0.
y equals the cosine of t and z is going to equal the sine of t.
What we need for the x direction is dx dt.
So dx is going to equal 0 dt.
dx is going to be 0 dt.
Certainly nothing is going to happen over as far as x is concerned.
And that immediately tells us that we needn't even do our whole function in this.
Let's do that, the f of x.
Our vector x was 3x plus 2y plus z.
So the f, if we had to reconstruct this as a vector in r,
that was going to be 3 times x is 0 plus 2 times cosine of t plus the sine of t.
But all of that would have to be,
this dx here is going to be replaced by 0 dt.
So all of this is 0.
So that's going to be the integral going from 0 to 1 of 0 dt.
And that just equals 0 as well.
So certainly in the x direction,
the line integral is 0.
We can just see in this x direction, which is down into the paper,
we go, we stay from 0 to 0.
So there's certainly no movement as far as this x value is concerned.
And the line integral there is definitely going to be 0.
And we remember that this curve, our curve is a union of curves 1 and 2.
So it's the union of the two line integral.
So our answer is just going to be still the negative 10.
We had initially for curve 1.
