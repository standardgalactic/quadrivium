Here's a summary of how to construct an augmented matrix from a system of linear equations:

1. **Matrix Dimensions**:
   - The number of rows (\( M \)) matches the number of equations.
   - The number of columns is \( N + 1 \), where \( N \) is the number of unknowns, plus one additional column for the constants.

2. **Constructing the Matrix**:
   - Each row corresponds to an equation.
   - The first \( N \) columns hold coefficients for variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_N \).
   - The last column contains the constant terms from each equation.

3. **Naming Constants**:
   - Constants are identified by their position in the matrix, such as row 1, column 1.

4. **Example of Accessing Elements**:
   - Elements are accessed using row and column numbers (e.g., row 2, column 1 refers to \( X_1 \)'s coefficient in the second equation).

The text concludes with some unclear instructions or examples about accessing specific matrix elements, likely part of a broader example.
