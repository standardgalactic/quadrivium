The provided text outlines a step-by-step process for preparing a dataset for training and testing with a deep neural network, focusing on tasks like splitting the data, separating features from targets, standardizing features, and evaluating model performance. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**:
   - The dataset is split using an 80-20 ratio.
   - Random shuffling ensures that both training and testing sets are representative of the entire dataset.

2. **Separate Features and Target Variables**:
   - Features (X) and target variables (y) are separated, with the assumption that the last column in each set is the target variable.

3. **Standardize the Features**:
   - Standardization ensures all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
   - This process uses a `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to transform both training and test datasets, ensuring consistency in feature scaling during model evaluation.

4. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
   - After the model is trained, predictions are made using the standardized test data.
   - The actual and predicted values are compared using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance.

By following these steps, the dataset becomes well-prepared for effective training and evaluation of a deep neural network in regression tasks.

The provided text outlines steps to evaluate a regression model's performance using Python, along with an overview of similar processes in the Wolfram Language (Mathematica). Here is a structured summary:

1. **Model Evaluation Metrics**:
   - The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is computed and printed. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors between actual and predicted values without considering their direction.
   - The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated using NumPy's `sqrt` and `mean_squared_error` functions, providing a measure that penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones.

2. **Visualization**:
   - A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values is created to visually assess the model's performance.
   - The plot includes a reference line (`y = x`) to help compare predictions against actual values.
   - Axis labels and title are added for clarity, enhancing interpretability of the model's accuracy.

3. **Wolfram Language Overview**:
   - In Mathematica, data preparation involves plotting actual vs. predicted values with labeled axes and adjusted aspect ratios.
   - Mean Absolute Error is calculated by taking the absolute difference between actual and negated predicted values.
   - The `predict` function in Mathematica automates machine learning tasks, selecting optimal algorithms like random forests or neural networks to maximize prediction quality.
   - Users can specify methods (e.g., neural networks) while allowing Mathematica to determine model structure automatically.
   - A comparison plot using a random forest shows an MSE of 0.52.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The Wolfram Language is highlighted for its automation and effectiveness in machine learning, with resources available through platforms like Udemy.
   - The text emphasizes the ease of use and powerful features provided by both Python and Mathematica for regression analysis using deep neural networks.

Overall, this summary captures the steps involved in evaluating a regression model's performance and highlights the capabilities of both Python and Wolfram Language tools.
