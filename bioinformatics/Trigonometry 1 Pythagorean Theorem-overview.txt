The text explains the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This relationship can be visualized through a diagram involving three larger squares: 

1. Square 1 has an area represented by \(3^2 = 9\) small squares.
2. Square 2 has an area represented by \(4^2 = 16\) small squares.
3. The sum of these areas (25 squares) equals the area of Square 3, which represents \(5^2\).

This demonstrates that if a right triangle's sides are labeled \(x\) and \(y\), with hypotenuse \(h\), then \(h^2 = x^2 + y^2\). This principle is known as the Pythagorean theorem.
