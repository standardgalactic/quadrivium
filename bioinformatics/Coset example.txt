So let's have a look at an example and here we're going to have a right coset because A is on the
right of H. So I'm going to define this as H, binary operation with A, so A on the right side,
a right coset of H. Remember H is a subgroup of some G. I'm going to define H as this permutation,
the set of these different permutations on the symmetric group S4. So I have 1, if I just write
it in this notation, it means 1 goes to 1, 2 to 2, 3 to 3, 4 to 4, the identity. And this goes 1 goes
to 2, 2 goes to 1, 3 goes to 3 and 4 goes to 4. And this one's 1 goes to 1, 2 goes to 2 and then 3
goes to 4 and 4 goes to 3. 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 1, 3 goes to 4, 4 goes to 3. And I have this
composition of these permutations as my group operation. And I have this A as an element.
It goes 1 goes to 4, 4 goes to 3, 3 goes to 2, 2 goes to 1. That's an element of the symmetric
group on 4 elements. So I'm suggesting now that H, A, that is going to equal, this must go on the
right. So it's going to be 1 composed with 1, 4, 3, 2. And I have 1, 2 composed with 1, 4, 3, 2.
And I have 3, 4 composed with 1, 4, 3, 2. And lastly, I have 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 composed with 1, 4, 3, 2.
And that is it. So how do we do this composition? Remember, if I have this composition of these
permutations, what happens on the right happens first and then on the left. And if you've got some
experience, you can do this all in your head. So let's just try that first one. Just if we can.
So 1 goes, just imagine that as 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. So 1 goes to, so we start with 1,
1 goes to 4 on the first side. And then 4, 4 goes to 4. In other words, 1 goes to 4.
If I think of 4, 4 goes to 3. And on that side, 3 goes to 3. So 4 eventually went to 3.
3 goes to 2 and 2 goes to 2. So 3 actually went to 2. And 2 goes to 1 and 1 goes to 1. So 2 goes to 1.
So that's done. And that's exactly as I would have had with my identity permutation there.
Let's do this one. Let's just do this one the long way. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Again, I'm going to start with 1. Remember, what happens on the right is first. So 1 goes to 4.
4 goes to 3. 3 goes to 2. And 2 goes to 1. And on this side, 1 goes to 2. 2 goes to 1. 3 goes to 3.
3 goes to 3. So if I start with 1, 1 goes to 4. 1 goes to 4. 4 goes to 3. 3 goes to 1.
So I'm back there. So I'm back there. And eventually, 2 is just going to go to 2. So we just leave that out.
For simplicity's sake, we leave that. So let's look at this one. I start again with 1. Let's try and do this one in our heads.
So if I think of what happens on the right-hand side first. 1 goes to 4. And 4 goes to 3. In other words, 1 goes to 3 in the end.
And then what happens to 3? 3 goes to 2. And 2 goes to 2. So 3 goes to 2. And then 2. 2 goes to 1.
2 goes to 1. And 1 goes to 1. So 2 goes to 1. So 2 goes to 1. So we are done with that one.
And that just leaves 4, which goes to 4. And on this last one, let's see what happens to 1.
And this last one, 1 goes to 4. And 4 goes to 3. So 1 goes to 3. And now 3 goes to 2.
3 goes to 2. And 2 goes to 1. So 3 goes to 1. So we are done with that one. That goes nowhere.
Let's see what happens to 2. 2 goes to 1. And 1 goes to 2. So 2 goes to 2. So 2 just goes to 2.
We leave that. And 4 will go to 4. Because 4 goes to 3. And 3 goes to 4.
In other words, 4 goes to 4. And we're just left with that.
So that's our right coset of H. With this A being one of these permutations on the symmetric group of 4 elements.
That would be AH. See if you can work out what the right coset of H is going to be with this same element A.
We have been hablando from the N was trying to work out what the right coset of H. With this
