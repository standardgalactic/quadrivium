Deep learning models, such as neural networks, leverage multiple layers to extract patterns and make predictions. Let's break down how this works, particularly focusing on a single hidden layer neural network.

### Structure of a Neural Network

1. **Input Layer:**
   - The input consists of feature variables represented as vectors. In your example, it's a column vector with three rows (features) and one column.

2. **Hidden Layer(s):**
   - A hidden layer processes the inputs using weights and biases. Each node in this layer receives inputs from all nodes in the previous layer.
   - The transformation involves matrix multiplication of input vectors with weight matrices, followed by adding bias terms.
   - Activation functions are applied to each node's output to introduce non-linearity. This is crucial as it allows the network to learn complex patterns.

3. **Output Layer:**
   - The final layer produces predictions based on the processed data from hidden layers.
   - For regression tasks, outputs may be directly used or passed through an activation function like identity (no change).
   - In classification tasks, different activations such as softmax are used for multi-class problems, or sigmoid for binary classification.

### Key Concepts

- **Weights and Biases:**
  - Weights (\(W\)) transform input data into a form that can be processed by subsequent layers.
  - Biases allow the model to adjust outputs independently of inputs, providing more flexibility in learning.

- **Activation Functions:**
  - These functions introduce non-linear transformations. Common ones include:
    - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Outputs zero for any negative input and linearly maps positive values.
    - **Sigmoid:** Maps inputs to a value between 0 and 1, often used in binary classification.
    - **Softmax:** Converts logits into probabilities that sum up to one, ideal for multi-class problems.

- **Forward Propagation:**
  - This is the process of passing input data through the network to obtain predictions. It involves:
    - Calculating weighted sums (plus biases).
    - Applying activation functions at each layer.
  
### Example Walkthrough

For your example with three inputs and a hidden layer:

1. **Input Vector:** \([x_1, x_2, x_3]^T\)

2. **Weight Matrix (\(W_1\)):** A 4x3 matrix since the hidden layer has four nodes.

3. **Bias Vector (\(b_1\)):** A 4x1 vector to accommodate biases for each node in the hidden layer.

4. **Calculation of Hidden Layer Outputs:**
   \[
   Z = W_1 \cdot X + b_1
   \]
   - Here, \(Z\) is a 4x1 column vector representing pre-activation outputs.
   - Apply ReLU activation to each element in \(Z\):
     \[
     A = g(Z) = \text{ReLU}(Z)
     \]

5. **Output Layer:**
   - If it’s a regression problem, the output might directly use \(A\) or further transform it through another layer.
   - For classification, apply an appropriate activation function like softmax for multi-class outputs.

### Summary

Neural networks build complexity by stacking layers and using non-linear activations to capture intricate patterns in data. The richness of these models allows them to generalize well across various tasks such as regression and classification. By adjusting weights through training (e.g., backpropagation), the network learns to make accurate predictions.

The text discusses how machine learning models, particularly neural networks, differ from simpler models like logistic regression by utilizing complex structures with many layers and parameters. The model's performance is evaluated using a cost function that aggregates errors across numerous connections, which can be substantial given the number of parameters involved.

This process occurs in a multi-dimensional space, where optimization techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent are employed to adjust weights and minimize error iteratively. By repeatedly applying these methods—updating weights based on partial derivatives—the model's accuracy improves over time until an optimal solution is reached. The author highlights that neural networks can learn more complex patterns compared to simpler models, potentially mimicking basic brain functions. Overall, the text emphasizes the complexity and capability of neural network algorithms in learning from data.
