The text explores different types of convergence for infinite series. It starts by discussing absolute and conditional convergence. An absolutely convergent series remains convergent even when all terms are replaced with their absolute values. Conversely, if a series converges but not absolutely (i.e., the series of absolute values diverges), it is conditionally convergent.

Several examples illustrate these concepts:

1. **Alternating Series Example**: The series \(\sum (-1)^k / k\) is given as an example. It converges due to the Alternating Series Test, but its absolute counterpart \(\sum 1/k\), known as the harmonic series, diverges. Thus, this series is conditionally convergent.

2. **Harmonic Series**: The text reiterates that the harmonic series diverges, reinforcing why certain alternating series can only be conditionally convergent.

3. **Sine over Cubed Example**: For the series \(\sum \sin(k) / k^3\), it's noted that while the terms oscillate between positive and negative values (not fitting a simple alternating pattern), they remain bounded by \(1/k^3\). Since \(\sum 1/k^3\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 > 1\), the comparison test shows \(\sum |\sin(k) / k^3|\) converges. Therefore, this series is absolutely convergent.

Overall, the text provides a detailed exploration of absolute and conditional convergence using examples to demonstrate how different tests can be applied to determine series behavior.
