The text explores different types of convergence for infinite series. It starts by discussing absolute and conditional convergence. An absolutely convergent series remains convergent even when all terms are replaced with their absolute values. Conversely, if a series converges but not absolutely (i.e., the series of absolute values diverges), it is conditionally convergent.

Several examples illustrate these concepts:

1. **Alternating Series Example**: The series \(\sum (-1)^k / k\) is given as an example. It converges due to the Alternating Series Test, but its absolute counterpart \(\sum 1/k\), known as the harmonic series, diverges. Thus, this series is conditionally convergent.

2. **Harmonic Series**: The text reiterates that the harmonic series diverges, reinforcing why certain alternating series can only be conditionally convergent.

3. **Sine over Cubed Example**: For the series \(\sum \sin(k) / k^3\), it's noted that while the terms oscillate between positive and negative values (not fitting a simple alternating pattern), they remain bounded by \(1/k^3\). Since \(\sum 1/k^3\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 > 1\), the comparison test shows \(\sum |\sin(k) / k^3|\) converges. Therefore, this series is absolutely convergent.

Overall, the text provides a detailed exploration of absolute and conditional convergence using examples to demonstrate how different tests can be applied to determine series behavior.

The text discusses concepts related to series convergence, focusing on absolute and conditional convergence:

1. **Absolute Convergence**: A series \(\sum a_k\) is absolutely convergent if the series of its absolute values \(\sum |a_k|\) converges. If \(\sum |a_k|\) converges, then \(\sum a_k\) also converges.

2. **Conditional Convergence**: A series \(\sum a_k\) is conditionally convergent if it converges but the series of its absolute values \(\sum |a_k|\) diverges.

3. **Examples and Tests**:
   - The text provides an example of an alternating series where the harmonic series (which diverges) shows that the original series is conditionally convergent.
   - For a non-alternating series like \(\sum \frac{\sin(k)}{k^3}\), it uses the comparison test. Since \(|\sin(k)| \leq 1\), \(\left|\frac{\sin(k)}{k^3}\right| \leq \frac{1}{k^3}\). The series \(\sum \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series (p > 1), so by comparison, the original series is absolutely convergent.

The discussion integrates various convergence tests to determine whether specific series are absolutely or conditionally convergent.
