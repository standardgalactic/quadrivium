The text provides a step-by-step guide on converting complex numbers \(z_1 = i\), \(z_2 = 1 - \sqrt{3}i\), and \(z_3 = \sqrt{3} + i\) into their polar forms, then performing operations with them. Here's the summary of each part:

### Converting to Polar Form

1. **\(z_1 = i\)**
   - Modulus \(r_1 = 1\).
   - Angle is \(90^\circ\) or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.
   - Polar form: \(z_1 = e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}}\).

2. **\(z_2 = 1 - \sqrt{3}i\)**
   - Modulus \(r_2 = 2\).
   - Angle is \(-\frac{\pi}{3}\) radians (quadrant IV, since cosine is positive and sine is negative).
   - Polar form: \(z_2 = 2e^{-i\frac{\pi}{3}}\).

3. **\(z_3 = \sqrt{3} + i\)**
   - Modulus \(r_3 = 2\).
   - Angle is \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians.
   - Polar form: \(z_3 = 2e^{i\frac{\pi}{6}}\).

### Calculating Expression

- **\(z_1 \times z_2\)**
  - Resulting modulus: \(r_1 \times r_2 = 2\).
  - Sum of angles: \(\frac{\pi}{2} + (-\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\pi}{6}\).
  - Polar form: \(z_1 \times z_2 = 2e^{i\frac{\pi}{6}}\) which simplifies to \(\sqrt{3} + i\).

- **\(z_1 \times z_2 / z_3\)**
  - Simplifying the expression using polar forms:
    - Divide the moduli: \(2/2 = 1\).
    - Subtract angles: \(\frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{\pi}{6} = 0\).
  - Result is \(1 \times e^{i \cdot 0} = 1\).

### Additional Problem

- The text briefly mentions finding the square roots of \(-i\) by expressing it in polar form and using De Moivre's theorem, though specifics are not detailed. 

This approach demonstrates converting complex numbers to polar form, performing multiplication and division, and understanding angles' impact on results.

The text provides a step-by-step process for expressing a complex number \( z \) in polar form and finding its square root using modulus, argument (angle), and De Moivre's theorem. Here’s a summary:

1. **Modulus of \( z \)**: 
   - Given \( z = 0 - i \), the modulus is calculated as \( \sqrt{0^2 + (-1)^2} = 1 \).

2. **Argument (Angle) of \( z \)**:
   - The angle \( \theta \) is determined by recognizing that \( -i \) points directly downward on the complex plane, corresponding to an angle of \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \) or \(-90^\circ\).

3. **Polar Form of \( z \)**:
   - Thus, \( z \) can be written as \( 1 (\cos(-\frac{\pi}{2}) + i \sin(-\frac{\pi}{2})) \).

4. **Finding Roots Using De Moivre's Theorem**:
   - To find the square root of \( z \), apply De Moivre’s theorem: for \( z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} (\cos(\theta/n + 2k\pi/n) + i \sin(\theta/n + 2k\pi/n)) \).
   - For \( n=2 \) (square root), the formula becomes:
     \[
     z^{1/2} = 1^{1/2} (\cos(-\frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi) + i \sin(-\frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi))
     \]
   - For \( k=0 \), the first root is:
     \[
     z_0^{1/2} = \cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}) + i \sin(-\frac{\pi}{4})
     \]

5. **Generalization**:
   - The text emphasizes understanding and internalizing these steps, particularly for students familiar with this type of mathematical operation, suggesting that knowledge should be intuitive.

Overall, the explanation combines the concepts of modulus, argument, polar form representation, and root extraction using De Moivre's theorem to find complex roots.

The text discusses trigonometric functions and their geometric interpretations, specifically focusing on angles measured in radians. It explains that the cosine of \(\pi/4\) is \(1/\sqrt{2}\). For negative angles, the sine function changes sign, so \(-\sin(\theta) = -\sin(\theta)\).

The text then describes how to visualize these values on a complex plane, where each angle corresponds to a vector. The magnitude of these vectors is determined by \(1/\sqrt{2}\), resulting in points that lie within the unit circle because \(1/\sqrt{2} < 1\). These vectors are plotted at \((1/\sqrt{2}, -1/\sqrt{2})\) and then rotated by \(\pi\) (180 degrees) to reach \((-1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2})\).

The process involves dividing a full rotation of \(2\pi\) into segments, each segment corresponding to an angle increment of \(\pi\), leading to vectors that are diametrically opposite on the unit circle. The text illustrates this through geometric rotations and vector addition without needing further complex calculations.

The text discusses simplifying an expression involving the square root of \(\pi\) and angles in trigonometry. It starts with a fraction involving negative \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) and some operations leading to \(\frac{3\pi}{4}\). The key point is understanding that adding \(\pi\) to an angle is equivalent to rotating by 180 degrees, simplifying the calculation of sine or cosine for this new angle. This approach emphasizes conceptual understanding over manual computation.
