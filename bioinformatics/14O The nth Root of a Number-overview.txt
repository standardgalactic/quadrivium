The text provides a step-by-step guide on converting complex numbers \(z_1 = i\), \(z_2 = 1 - \sqrt{3}i\), and \(z_3 = \sqrt{3} + i\) into their polar forms, then performing operations with them. Here's the summary of each part:

### Converting to Polar Form

1. **\(z_1 = i\)**
   - Modulus \(r_1 = 1\).
   - Angle is \(90^\circ\) or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.
   - Polar form: \(z_1 = e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}}\).

2. **\(z_2 = 1 - \sqrt{3}i\)**
   - Modulus \(r_2 = 2\).
   - Angle is \(-\frac{\pi}{3}\) radians (quadrant IV, since cosine is positive and sine is negative).
   - Polar form: \(z_2 = 2e^{-i\frac{\pi}{3}}\).

3. **\(z_3 = \sqrt{3} + i\)**
   - Modulus \(r_3 = 2\).
   - Angle is \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians.
   - Polar form: \(z_3 = 2e^{i\frac{\pi}{6}}\).

### Calculating Expression

- **\(z_1 \times z_2\)**
  - Resulting modulus: \(r_1 \times r_2 = 2\).
  - Sum of angles: \(\frac{\pi}{2} + (-\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\pi}{6}\).
  - Polar form: \(z_1 \times z_2 = 2e^{i\frac{\pi}{6}}\) which simplifies to \(\sqrt{3} + i\).

- **\(z_1 \times z_2 / z_3\)**
  - Simplifying the expression using polar forms:
    - Divide the moduli: \(2/2 = 1\).
    - Subtract angles: \(\frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{\pi}{6} = 0\).
  - Result is \(1 \times e^{i \cdot 0} = 1\).

### Additional Problem

- The text briefly mentions finding the square roots of \(-i\) by expressing it in polar form and using De Moivre's theorem, though specifics are not detailed. 

This approach demonstrates converting complex numbers to polar form, performing multiplication and division, and understanding angles' impact on results.

The text provides a step-by-step process for expressing a complex number \( z \) in polar form and finding its square root using modulus, argument (angle), and De Moivre's theorem. Here’s a summary:

1. **Modulus of \( z \)**: 
   - Given \( z = 0 - i \), the modulus is calculated as \( \sqrt{0^2 + (-1)^2} = 1 \).

2. **Argument (Angle) of \( z \)**:
   - The angle \( \theta \) is determined by recognizing that \( -i \) points directly downward on the complex plane, corresponding to an angle of \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \) or \(-90^\circ\).

3. **Polar Form of \( z \)**:
   - Thus, \( z \) can be written as \( 1 (\cos(-\frac{\pi}{2}) + i \sin(-\frac{\pi}{2})) \).

4. **Finding Roots Using De Moivre's Theorem**:
   - To find the square root of \( z \), apply De Moivre’s theorem: for \( z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} (\cos(\theta/n + 2k\pi/n) + i \sin(\theta/n + 2k\pi/n)) \).
   - For \( n=2 \) (square root), the formula becomes:
     \[
     z^{1/2} = 1^{1/2} (\cos(-\frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi) + i \sin(-\frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi))
     \]
   - For \( k=0 \), the first root is:
     \[
     z_0^{1/2} = \cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}) + i \sin(-\frac{\pi}{4})
     \]

5. **Generalization**:
   - The text emphasizes understanding and internalizing these steps, particularly for students familiar with this type of mathematical operation, suggesting that knowledge should be intuitive.

Overall, the explanation combines the concepts of modulus, argument, polar form representation, and root extraction using De Moivre's theorem to find complex roots.

The text discusses trigonometric functions and their geometric interpretations, specifically focusing on angles measured in radians. It explains that the cosine of \(\pi/4\) is \(1/\sqrt{2}\). For negative angles, the sine function changes sign, so \(-\sin(\theta) = -\sin(\theta)\).

The text then describes how to visualize these values on a complex plane, where each angle corresponds to a vector. The magnitude of these vectors is determined by \(1/\sqrt{2}\), resulting in points that lie within the unit circle because \(1/\sqrt{2} < 1\). These vectors are plotted at \((1/\sqrt{2}, -1/\sqrt{2})\) and then rotated by \(\pi\) (180 degrees) to reach \((-1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2})\).

The process involves dividing a full rotation of \(2\pi\) into segments, each segment corresponding to an angle increment of \(\pi\), leading to vectors that are diametrically opposite on the unit circle. The text illustrates this through geometric rotations and vector addition without needing further complex calculations.

The text discusses simplifying an expression involving the square root of \(\pi\) and angles in trigonometry. It starts with a fraction involving negative \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) and some operations leading to \(\frac{3\pi}{4}\). The key point is understanding that adding \(\pi\) to an angle is equivalent to rotating by 180 degrees, simplifying the calculation of sine or cosine for this new angle. This approach emphasizes conceptual understanding over manual computation.

The text provides a detailed explanation of converting complex numbers \( z_1 = i \), \( z_2 = 1 - \sqrt{3}i \), and \( z_3 = \sqrt{3} + i \) into their polar forms, followed by calculating the expression \( \frac{z_1 \times z_2}{z_3} \).

### Polar Form Conversion:

1. **\( z_1 = i \):**
   - Modulus (\( r_1 \)): 1 (since \( |i| = \sqrt{0^2 + 1^2} = 1 \))
   - Argument: \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians (90 degrees, as \( i \) is on the positive imaginary axis)
   - Polar form: \( z_1 = e^{i\pi/2} \)

2. **\( z_2 = 1 - \sqrt{3}i \):**
   - Modulus (\( r_2 \)): 2 (since \( |1 - \sqrt{3}i| = \sqrt{1^2 + (-\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \))
   - Argument: \(-\frac{\pi}{3}\) radians (as it lies in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive and sine is negative)
   - Polar form: \( z_2 = 2e^{-i\pi/3} \)

3. **\( z_3 = \sqrt{3} + i \):**
   - Modulus (\( r_3 \)): 2 (since \( |\sqrt{3} + i| = \sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \))
   - Argument: \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians (as it lies in the first quadrant, where both cosine and sine are positive)
   - Polar form: \( z_3 = 2e^{i\pi/6} \)

### Calculation of \( \frac{z_1 \times z_2}{z_3} \):

- **Product \( z_1 \times z_2 \):**
  - Modulus: \( r_1 \times r_2 = 1 \times 2 = 2 \)
  - Argument: \( \frac{\pi}{2} + (-\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\pi}{6} \)
  - Polar form: \( z_1 \times z_2 = 2e^{i\pi/6} \)

- **Division by \( z_3 \):**
  - Modulus: \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)
  - Argument: \( \frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{\pi}{6} = 0 \)
  - Result: \( e^{i \cdot 0} = 1 \)

The expression simplifies to 1. The text also mentions finding the square roots of \(-i\), but this part is not fully detailed in the provided excerpt.

The text explains how to find the square root of a complex number \( z = -i \) using polar form. Here’s a summary:

1. **Modulus and Angle**: The modulus (magnitude) of \( z \) is calculated as 1, since it equals the square root of \( 0^2 + (-1)^2 \). The angle (\(\theta\)) for \( -i \) on the complex plane is \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) (or -90 degrees), as it points directly downward.

2. **Polar Form**: In polar form, \( z \) can be expressed as \( 1 \times (\cos(-\frac{\pi}{2}) + i \sin(-\frac{\pi}{2})) \).

3. **Finding Roots**: To find the square root of \( z \), use the formula for nth roots:
   \[
   z^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{r} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right)
   \]
   where \( r \) is the modulus, \( \theta \) is the angle, and \( k \) is an integer.

4. **Calculating for \( n = 2 \)**: For the square root (\( n = 2 \)), calculate:
   - When \( k = 0 \): 
     \[
     z^{1/2} = 1 \times \left(\cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)
     \]
     This gives one of the square roots.

The text emphasizes understanding these concepts intuitively, particularly for students familiar with mathematical principles.

The text discusses trigonometric functions and their geometric representations in the complex plane, particularly focusing on cosine and sine values for specific angles.

1. The cosine of \(\pi/4\) is given as \(1/\sqrt{2}\).
2. For a negative angle, the sine function changes sign: \(-\sin(\theta) = - (\text{sine of } \theta)\). Thus, \(-\sin(\pi/4)\) is also expressed as \(-1/\sqrt{2}i\).

The text then describes how to visualize these trigonometric values on the complex plane:
- A vector corresponding to \(1/\sqrt{2}\) and \(-1/\sqrt{2}i\) is drawn. On a real axis, it's placed slightly less than 1 because the denominator (\(\sqrt{2}\)) is larger than the numerator (1). The negative imaginary component places it in the fourth quadrant.
- For full rotations, \(2\pi\) represents one complete rotation. By dividing this into equal parts and rotating by \(\pi\), vectors are placed directly opposite each other on a circle's circumference.

The text implies a sequence of vectors or points created through these rotational steps:
1. The first vector is at \(1/\sqrt{2} - 1/\sqrt{2}i\).
2. A rotation by \(\pi\) results in the second vector, \(-1/\sqrt{2} + 1/\sqrt{2}i\).

This sequence suggests a method of generating vectors on the complex plane through systematic rotations.

The text describes a mathematical process involving angles and trigonometric functions. It starts with manipulating an expression related to \(\sqrt{\pi}\) and simplifies fractions of \(\pi\) (specifically dealing with \(-\frac{\pi}{4} + 4\) and converting it into \(\frac{3\pi}{4}\)). The key idea is understanding that adding \(\pi\) radians (or 180 degrees) to an angle effectively rotates the point on the unit circle by half a rotation. This insight simplifies calculations involving sine and cosine functions, as angles shifted by \(\pi\) radians have specific properties (e.g., they are in opposite positions on the circle). The focus is on grasping this conceptual understanding rather than just performing mechanical calculations.
