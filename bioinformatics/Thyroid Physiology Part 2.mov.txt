In this second part of thyroid physiology, we'll look at what increases and what decreases thyroid hormone production, specifically T3 and T4.
Thyroid hormone production is increased by TSH, or thyroid stimulating hormone, by catecholamines, and by human chorionic gonadotropin.
TSH forms part of the classical negative feedback system of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and is excreted by the pituitary.
Its major action on the thyroid is to stimulate cell growth and to stimulate cell differentiation.
It stimulates iodine uptake and organification, and it may also stimulate the growth and invasive characteristics of some well-differentiated thyroid cancers.
TSH release is stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone, or TRH, from the hypothalamus, and also by reduced levels of T3.
Catecholamines, especially adrenaline, causes an increase in T3 and T4 production.
An increase in thyroid hormone production is called hyperthyroidism, and it increases the body's metabolic rate.
One of the pathways is to make tissue more sensitive to catecholamines, and thus the hyperadrogenic state during hyperthyroidism.
Human chorionic gonadotropin is released during pregnancy, and also by some gynecological tumors.
Thyroid hormone production is decreased by glucocorticoids, by severe illness, by an excessive dose of iodide, and by antithyroid drugs.
Glucocorticoids suppresses TSH secretion, and thereby suppresses thyroid hormone production and release.
Severe and critical illness, as well as chronic hyperthermia and starvation, will decrease thyroid hormone levels, but with normal TSH levels.
An excessive dose of iodide increases organification, but then decreases hormone production, and this is called the Wilf-Tchaikov effect.
Lastly, there are various antithyroid drugs that will decrease thyroid production.
Thank you.
Thank you.
