The text outlines a methodology for analyzing patient data based on survival status through several steps:

1. **Splitting the Dataset**: The dataset is divided into two groups using software, categorized by survival status (survived or died).

2. **Descriptive Statistics Analysis**: Descriptive statistics, such as mean and standard deviation of age, are calculated for each group.

3. **Data Visualization**: Box plots are used to visually compare the age distributions between the two groups.

4. **Reverting Dataset Changes**: It is crucial to revert the dataset to its original state after analysis to avoid unintended future splits, ensuring data integrity.

The tutorial provides a straightforward approach for splitting datasets by categorical variables and highlights reverting changes post-analysis. More complex methods, like using numerical ranges, are mentioned but not detailed in this context.
