The text recounts the author's recent experiences in Newlands Forest, South Africa. The author shares their encounter with a boomslang—a highly venomous snake—and mentions it was an unexpected sighting close to the forest entrance, where foot traffic is common and proximity to houses makes snakes seem unlikely. This encounter led them to avoid the area for a few days, opting instead to run on roads.

Additionally, they mention having seen two other boomslangs further up in Cecilia Forest. The author also notes uploading educational videos related to group actions in abstract algebra, explaining these concepts with examples and proofs, encouraging viewers to check out the content for important insights into permutations and group theory. They plan to return for another run soon, possibly exploring different routes.
