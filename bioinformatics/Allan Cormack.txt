This episode of Let's Talk Surgery is going to be really short. It's almost like
a tweet. Now the last couple of days we've been celebrating the life of Chris
Barnard, the first heart transplant here at Gridderskeer Hospital in Cape Town.
And it has had an enormous impact. So many people's lives saved and changed by
that first heart transplant. Now there's someone else's work I want to talk to
you about in this in this episode though. Someone else whose work has had a much
much larger impact in medicine. And it's someone who we almost never talk about.
Of course that is Alan Cormack. Now Alan Cormack was born in Johannesburg 1927 and
he received his BSc in physics here at the University of Cape Town. And it is
while he was working at Gridderskeer Hospital that he did some work that
ultimately led to him winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in
1979. And that of course was the mathematical underpinnings of the CT
scanner.
Really a fundamental part of our daily work. We can do very little these days
without a CT scanner. I'm going to leave some links in the description below, read
up, find out more about Alan Cormack. There's even a book, a biography of Alan
Cormack that you can buy right on Amazon. Find out more about him.
