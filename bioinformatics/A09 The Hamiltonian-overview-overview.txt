The text outlines the derivation of Hamilton’s equations from Lagrangian mechanics using calculus and principles of physics. Here's a concise overview:

1. **Start with Granger's Equation**: The derivation begins by considering derivatives of the Lagrangian \( L \) concerning generalized coordinates \( Q \) and their velocities \( \dot{Q} \).

2. **Apply Calculus**: It demonstrates that for a function \( f(x, y, t) \), its total derivative can be broken down into partial derivatives times their respective rates (like velocity \( \dot{x} \)).

3. **Lagrangian as a Function**: The Lagrangian \( L(q, \dot{q}, t) \) is defined in terms of generalized coordinates \( q \), velocities \( \dot{q} \), and time \( t \).

4. **Simplify the Expression**: Manipulating these derivatives simplifies the expression to show that changes in momentum relate directly to energy terms.

5. **Time Independence Requirement**: For deriving Hamilton's equations, it is crucial that the Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on time (\( t \)), avoiding hidden time dependencies in the system.

6. **Define the Hamiltonian**: When there’s no explicit time dependence, the expression simplifies further to define the Hamiltonian \( H \). The Hamiltonian corresponds to the total energy (kinetic plus potential) when no time-related hidden degrees of freedom exist.

7. **Concluding Insight**: Under these conditions, the Hamiltonian represents the system's total energy and is expressed as a sum of kinetic and potential energies:
   \[
   H = T + V = \frac{1}{2}M\dot{Q}^2 + V(Q)
   \]
where \( M \) denotes mass, \( \dot{Q} \) indicates velocity, and \( V(Q) \) is the potential energy.

This summary encapsulates how Lagrangian mechanics transitions into Hamiltonian mechanics in classical physics.
