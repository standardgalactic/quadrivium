The text explores interactions between electric and magnetic fields on electrons through several physics problems:

1. **Electric and Magnetic Fields Interaction**: An electron moving under perpendicular electric (1,500 V/m) and magnetic (0.400 T) fields achieves equilibrium when its velocity \( v \) satisfies the equation \( v = E/B \), where \( E \) is the electric field strength and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength. This condition ensures that the forces due to both fields cancel each other out.

2. **Hall Effect**: In a metal plate with current flowing vertically, conduction electrons are affected by an applied magnetic field. The magnetic force causes electron accumulation on one side of the plate, generating an electric field opposing this force. Equilibrium is reached when these two forces balance.

3. **Calculating Drift Velocity and Charge Carrier Density**:
   - The drift velocity \( v_d \) can be calculated using \( v_d = E/B \).
   - The charge carrier density \( n \) is determined by the formula \( n = i/(e \cdot b \cdot l \cdot v) \), where \( i \) represents current, \( e \) is the electron charge, \( b \) is the magnetic field strength, \( l \) is the length of the conductor, and \( v \) is the drift velocity.

These principles are crucial for measuring physical properties such as the number density of charge carriers in materials.
