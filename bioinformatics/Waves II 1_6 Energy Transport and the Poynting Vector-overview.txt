The text explores calculating the maximum electric and magnetic fields from sunlight's intensity and evaluates the sensitivity of the Arecibo telescope in detecting extremely weak signals from space.

1. **Electric and Magnetic Fields Calculation:**
   - The intensity of sunlight before reaching Earth is given as 1.4 kW/m².
   - Using the equation for intensity (\(I = \frac{E_m^2}{2\mu_0 c}\)), where \(c\) is the speed of light and \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space, we can find:
     - Maximum electric field (\(E_m\)) using: 
       \[
       E_m = \sqrt{2Ic\mu_0}
       \]
     - Maximum magnetic field (\(B_m\)) using:
       \[
       B_m = \frac{E_m}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu_0 I}{c}}
       \]
   - The calculated values are approximately 1.03 kV/m for \(E_m\) and 3.3 μT for \(B_m\).

2. **Arecibo Telescope Sensitivity:**
   - The Arecibo telescope, with a 300-meter diameter (150-meter radius), can detect power as low as 1 picowatt over the entire Earth's surface.
   - Given Earth's radius (\(6.37 \times 10^6\) m), the intensity of such a signal is calculated as:
     \[
     I = \frac{1 \text{ pW}}{4\pi (6.37 \times 10^6)^2} \approx 1.96 \times 10^{-27} \text{ W/m}^2
     \]
   - The power detected by the Arecibo telescope is:
     \[
     P = I \cdot \pi \cdot (150)^2 \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-23} \text{ W}
     \]

3. **Power Output of Sagittarius A* Calculation:**
   - To find the power output at the center of our galaxy, where the distance is \(2.2 \times 10^4\) light years:
     - Convert light years to meters using the speed of light and seconds in a year.
     - Using the intensity-distance relationship (\(I = \frac{P}{4\pi R^2}\)), solve for power (\(P\)):
       \[
       P = I \cdot 4\pi R^2
       \]
   - The calculated power output is approximately \(1.1 \times 10^{15}\) watts, indicating a massive energy source like Sagittarius A*.
