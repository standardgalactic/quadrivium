The text explains how to find the indefinite integral of \( \frac{1}{u} \, du \). It clarifies that while integrating powers of \( u \) typically results in using the formula \( \frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1} \), this doesn't work for \( n = -1 \) since it involves division by zero. Instead, the integral of \( u^{-1} \, du \) is defined as the natural logarithm: 

\[ \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln |u| + C \]

This definition arises from the properties of definite integrals and aligns with the natural logarithm's definition for positive values. The text then extends this to functions by using substitution:

If \( u = f(x) \), then \( du = f'(x) \, dx \). Thus, 

\[ \int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \, dx = \ln |f(x)| + C \]

The explanation continues with an example of evaluating a definite integral using this substitution method:

For the integral from 0 to 2 of \( \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5} \, dx \), by recognizing that the denominator's derivative is present in the numerator, it simplifies directly to:

\[ \left[ \ln |x^2 - 5| \right]_0^2 = \ln |4 - 5| - \ln |-5| = \ln 1 - \ln 5 = 0 - \ln 5 = -\ln 5 \]

This method confirms the result through substitution:

Let \( u = x^2 - 5 \), then \( du = 2x \, dx \). The limits change accordingly: when \( x = 0 \), \( u = -5 \); when \( x = 2 \), \( u = -1 \).

\[ \int_{-5}^{-1} \frac{1}{u} \, du = [\ln |u|]_{-5}^{-1} = \ln |-1| - \ln |-5| = \ln 1 - \ln 5 = -\ln 5 \]

Both methods yield the same result: \( -\ln 5 \).
