The text introduces the method of reduction of order for solving higher-order linear differential equations, specifically focusing on second-order equations. The process requires one known non-trivial solution, \( y_1 \), which is valid over an interval \( i \). To form a general solution to the differential equation, another linearly independent solution, \( y_2 \), must be found. This can be done by expressing \( y_2 \) as \( y = u(x) \cdot y_1 \), where \( u(x) \) is a function to be determined.

By applying the product rule for differentiation, the derivatives of \( y \) are expressed in terms of \( u \) and its derivatives. These expressions are then substituted back into the original differential equation. This substitution transforms the problem into a new differential equation involving \( u' \) (and subsequently \( w = u' \)), which can be solved to find \( u(x) \).

Finally, once \( u(x) \) is determined, it is integrated and substituted back to obtain \( y_2 \). The general solution of the original differential equation then becomes a combination of \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \), forming a family of solutions. An example in subsequent material will clarify this reduction process for second-order linear differential equations.
