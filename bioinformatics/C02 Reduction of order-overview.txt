The text introduces the method of reduction of order for solving higher-order linear differential equations, specifically focusing on second-order equations. The process requires one known non-trivial solution, \( y_1 \), which is valid over an interval \( i \). To form a general solution to the differential equation, another linearly independent solution, \( y_2 \), must be found. This can be done by expressing \( y_2 \) as \( y = u(x) \cdot y_1 \), where \( u(x) \) is a function to be determined.

By applying the product rule for differentiation, the derivatives of \( y \) are expressed in terms of \( u \) and its derivatives. These expressions are then substituted back into the original differential equation. This substitution transforms the problem into a new differential equation involving \( u' \) (and subsequently \( w = u' \)), which can be solved to find \( u(x) \).

Finally, once \( u(x) \) is determined, it is integrated and substituted back to obtain \( y_2 \). The general solution of the original differential equation then becomes a combination of \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \), forming a family of solutions. An example in subsequent material will clarify this reduction process for second-order linear differential equations.

The text discusses a method called "reduction of order" for solving higher-order linear differential equations, specifically focusing on second-order ones. This approach is used when one solution \( y_1 \) (a non-trivial solution on some interval) is already known. The goal is to find a second, linearly independent solution \( y_2 \), so the general solution can be formed as a combination of both.

Key points include:
- For a second-order differential equation, two solutions (\( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \)) are needed.
- These solutions must be linearly independent; otherwise, they won't form a complete basis for the solution space.
- The quotient of \( y_2/y_1 \) should not be constant to ensure linear independence.

The method involves expressing \( y_2 \) as \( y = u(x)y_1 \), where \( u(x) \) is a function to be determined. Using this substitution:
- Derivatives are calculated using the product rule: \( y' = u'y + uy_1' \) and further for \( y'' \).
- Substitute these derivatives into the original differential equation.
- The resulting expression can be simplified by introducing a new variable \( w = u' \), reducing it to a first-order differential equation in terms of \( w \).

This process transforms the problem, making it easier to solve. After solving for \( w \) and back-substituting, integrating yields \( u(x) \). Finally, substituting back provides \( y_2 \), completing the set of solutions. The text suggests that examples will follow to illustrate this method in practice.
