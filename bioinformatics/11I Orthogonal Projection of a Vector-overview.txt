The video explains how a vector \( \mathbf{n} = (a, b) \) is orthogonal (perpendicular) to a straight line with the equation \( ax + by + c = 0 \). To show this, it demonstrates that the dot product of \( \mathbf{n} \) and any direction vector on the line results in zero. By selecting two points on the line and forming a direction vector between them, subtracting these point vectors from one another gives a new vector parallel to the line. The orthogonal condition is confirmed when the dot product of this derived vector with \( (a, b) \) equals zero.

The video also discusses finding the shortest distance \( d \) from a point \( P_0(x_0, y_0) \) to the line \( ax + by + c = 0 \). This is achieved by determining the perpendicular distance using vector projection. It involves projecting the vector from any point on the line \( Q(x_1, y_1) \) to \( P_0 \) onto the normal vector \( (a, b) \). The formula used for this orthogonal projection results in calculating the absolute value of the dot product between the vectors divided by the norm of the normal vector. This process yields the shortest distance from the point to the line.

The text explains how to calculate the shortest distance between a point and a line in two-dimensional space using vector projection. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The line equation can be expressed as \(Ax + By + C = 0\). Given specific coefficients for A, B, and C, this becomes a recognizable form of the line.

2. **Point Coordinates**: You're given a point \(P_0\) with coordinates \((X_0, Y_0)\).

3. **Distance Formula**: The shortest distance from the point to the line is calculated using:
   \[
   D = \frac{|AX_0 + BY_0 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
   \]

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - For a specific example, you have a line \(3X + 4Y - 6 = 0\) and a point \(P_0(1, -2)\).
   - Substitute into the formula: 
     \[
     D = \frac{|3 \times 1 + 4 \times (-2) - 6|}{\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}}
     \]
   - Simplify to find:
     \[
     D = \frac{|3 - 8 - 6|}{5} = \frac{|-11|}{5} = \frac{11}{5}
     \]

This process demonstrates how to apply the formula for finding the perpendicular (shortest) distance from a point to a line using vector projection principles.

The text appears to be somewhat disjointed and contains elements of mathematical discussion, personal reflection, and unrelated statements. Here’s an attempt to summarize the key points:

1. **Mathematical Reference**: The text begins with a simple math problem: "-14 plus 3 equals -11," but it emphasizes the absolute value, which is 11.

2. **Conceptual Understanding**: There's a mention of needing to understand specific concepts or variables (X0 and Y0) without providing clear context.

3. **Reflection on Experience**: The speaker mentions having adjusted something many times but acknowledges an ongoing problem that remains difficult to explain.

4. **Personal Insight**: A statement about the speed of thinking being beautiful, though it is unclear how this connects with other parts of the text.

5. **Numerical Mentions**: Various numbers are mentioned (e.g., "6-8," "Day 25," "Hot 28"), but their relevance is not clear within the context provided.

6. **Miscellaneous Statements**: There are several unrelated or cryptic phrases, such as references to cost ("High five times is $25") and possibly cultural or linguistic elements (e.g., "輪 Munro").

Overall, the text seems like a mix of mathematical discussion, personal musings, and fragmented thoughts without a clear overarching theme.
