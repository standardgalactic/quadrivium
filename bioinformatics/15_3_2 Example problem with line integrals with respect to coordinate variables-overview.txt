The text describes how to evaluate a line integral of the function \( f(x, y) = xy \) along a line segment from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \). The line is defined by the equation \( y = 2x + 1 \).

To solve this, the curve is parametrized using \( t \), where \( x = t \) and thus \( y = 2t + 1 \). This gives a vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t, 2t + 1) \).

The function in terms of \( t \) becomes:
\[ f(\mathbf{r}(t)) = x \cdot y = t(2t + 1) = 2t^2 + t. \]

Since \( x = t \), it follows that \( dx = dt \). The integral to evaluate is:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (2t^2 + t) \, dt.
\]

Calculating the integral:
\[
\int (2t^2 + t) \, dt = \frac{2}{3}t^3 + \frac{1}{2}t^2.
\]

Evaluating from 0 to 1:
\[
\left[\frac{2}{3}(1)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(1)^2\right] - \left[\frac{2}{3}(0)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(0)^2\right] = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = \frac{7}{6}.
\]

Thus, the value of the line integral is \( \frac{7}{6} \).

The text provides an example of evaluating a line integral for the function \( f(x, y) = xy \) along a line segment from point (0, 1) to (1, 3). The line is described by the equation \( y = 2x + 1 \), and \( x \) ranges from 0 to 1.

To compute this integral, we parametrize the curve using \( x = t \) which implies \( y = 2t + 1 \). Thus, the parameterized vector is \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t, 2t + 1) \), with \( t \) ranging from 0 to 1.

Substituting these into the function \( f(x, y) = xy \), we get:
\[ f(\mathbf{r}(t)) = t(2t + 1) = 2t^2 + t. \]

Since \( dx/dt = 1 \), we have \( dx = dt \). The line integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 (2t^2 + t) \, dt.
\]

Evaluating this integral gives:
\[
\left[ \frac{2}{3}t^3 + \frac{1}{2}t^2 \right]_0^1 = \frac{2}{3}(1)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 - \left( \frac{2}{3}(0)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(0)^2 \right) = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Simplifying, the result is:
\[ 
\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = \frac{7}{6}. 
\]

Thus, the value of the line integral is \( \frac{7}{6} \).
