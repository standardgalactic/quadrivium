The text introduces the concepts of "Transient" and "Steady State" terms in solutions to certain mathematical problems. The discussion highlights issues with using OneNote on Apple systems for printing purposes but quickly shifts focus back to the mathematics.

In a previous example, two sets were identified: the complimentary set (transient term) and the particular set (steady state term). When multiplying an exponential decay function by an independent variable, it creates a non-periodic function. This transient term initially affects the solution but eventually diminishes over time, disappearing from the graph as it approaches zero.

The steady state term remains and represents periodic behavior, such as oscillations that stabilize quickly. In situations where the driving force divided by mass is a periodic function (involving sine or cosine), both the transient and particular sets combine to form what's called the "steady state term."

In summary, solutions consist of both transient terms (which fade over time) and steady state terms (which persist). Over time, the effect of the transient component vanishes, leaving only the steady state behavior.
