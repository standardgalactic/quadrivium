The text introduces the concepts of "Transient" and "Steady State" terms in solutions to certain mathematical problems. The discussion highlights issues with using OneNote on Apple systems for printing purposes but quickly shifts focus back to the mathematics.

In a previous example, two sets were identified: the complimentary set (transient term) and the particular set (steady state term). When multiplying an exponential decay function by an independent variable, it creates a non-periodic function. This transient term initially affects the solution but eventually diminishes over time, disappearing from the graph as it approaches zero.

The steady state term remains and represents periodic behavior, such as oscillations that stabilize quickly. In situations where the driving force divided by mass is a periodic function (involving sine or cosine), both the transient and particular sets combine to form what's called the "steady state term."

In summary, solutions consist of both transient terms (which fade over time) and steady state terms (which persist). Over time, the effect of the transient component vanishes, leaving only the steady state behavior.

The text introduces the concepts of "Transient" and "Steady State" terms in the context of solving differential equations. It begins by discussing technical difficulties using an online version of OneNote on Apple systems for printing purposes, but quickly shifts focus to explaining these mathematical terms.

In a previous example, two sets were identified: the complementary (transient) set and the particular (steady state) set. The transient term is illustrated with a function that decreases rapidly, eventually becoming zero as it crosses the x-axis. This represents the transient behavior in a solution which disappears over time.

Conversely, the steady state term involves an oscillating component that quickly settles into a consistent pattern or amplitude. When these two terms are combined—transient and steady state—the result is initially non-periodic but eventually converges to a periodic function if the driving force is itself periodic (like sine or cosine).

The key takeaway is that while both transient and steady state components exist in solutions, the transient term diminishes over time, leaving only the steady state as the long-term behavior of the system. The text suggests revisiting these concepts later for further explanation on their alternate forms and integration into comprehensive solutions.
