The course "Statistics for Healthcare, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Using the R Language for Statistical Computing" is offered by Stellenbosch University. Led by Dr. Jean Klapper, it aims to equip participants with statistical analysis skills using R across various fields such as healthcare and social sciences. The course is intensive but promises a robust understanding of R-based statistical analysis.

Participants will access video lectures, PDFs, practice exercises, solution sets, and live online sessions via RStudio Cloud, which enables working on projects without local software installation. The course comprises 15 chapters:

1. **Introduction** - Course topics overview.
2. **R Language and RStudio** - Basics of R programming.
3. **Study Types** - Various study designs and research question formulation.
4. **Statistical Terms and Definitions** - Fundamental statistical concepts.
5. **Data Manipulation in R** - Techniques for data import, indexing, and subsetting.
6. **Tidy Data Principles** - Advanced R data manipulation.
7. **Summarizing Data** - Calculating descriptive statistics.
8. **Comparative Summary Statistics** - Group comparison techniques.
9. **Data Visualization** - Representing data visually.

Further chapters cover advanced topics such as sampling (Chapter 10), parametric methods for comparing means like t-tests and ANOVA (Chapter 11), linear models including regression analyses (Chapter 12), group comparisons and assumption testing (Chapter 13), non-parametric tests when assumptions are violated (Chapter 14), and tests for non-numerical variables like Chi-squared test (final chapter).

Dr. Klapper encourages active engagement, highlighting the support of a vast R user community. The course aims to prepare participants as domain experts leveraging data analysis in their fields. Participants are advised to review specific chapter schedules and prepare before starting the course.
