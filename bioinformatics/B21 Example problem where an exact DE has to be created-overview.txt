The text provides an example of solving a differential equation using various techniques. The initial equation given is \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{xy}{20 - 2x^2 - 3y^2}\). 

1. **Separation of Variables:** Initially, the problem is identified as difficult to separate variables.

2. **Linear Equation:** It's determined that the equation cannot be written in a standard linear form with an integrating factor.

3. **Exact Equations:** The equation is transformed into \(xy \, dx + (20 - 2x^2 - 3y^2) \, dy = 0\) to check for exactness. 

4. **Integrating Factor:** Since the equation isn't exact, an integrating factor is sought. It turns out that a function of \(y\), specifically \(y^3\), can be used as an integrating factor.

5. **Exact Equation Achieved:** After multiplying through by this integrating factor, the transformed equation becomes exact.

6. **Solution Process:**
   - Integrate with respect to \(x\) to find part of the potential function.
   - Differentiate and integrate with respect to \(y\) to determine another part of the potential function.
   - Combine these results to express a solution implicitly as \(\frac{1}{2} x^2 y^4 + \frac{1}{2} y^6 - 5y^4 = C\), where \(C\) is a constant.

The process highlights finding an appropriate integrating factor to convert the differential equation into an exact form, allowing for integration and solution derivation.

The text discusses solving a differential equation given by:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{xy}{20 - 2x^2 - 3y^2}
\]

Initially, the solver considers various techniques such as separation of variables and linear equations but finds them unsuitable. The focus shifts to determining if the equation is exact or can be made exact using an integrating factor.

The process involves rearranging terms:

1. Rewrite the differential equation in a recognizable form for an exact equation:
   \[
   (20 - 2x^2 - 3y^2) \, dy = xy \, dx
   \]
   This becomes:
   \[
   xy \, dx + (2x^2 + 3y^2 - 20) \, dy = 0
   \]

2. Check for exactness by calculating partial derivatives \( M_y \) and \( N_x \), where \( M = xy \) and \( N = 2x^2 + 3y^2 - 20 \). The equation is not exact since \( M_y \neq N_x \).

3. Determine an integrating factor that depends solely on \( y \):
   \[
   \mu(y) = e^{\int \frac{4}{xy} dy} = y^3
   \]
   This choice satisfies the condition for the integrating factor.

4. Multiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor \( y^3 \), making it exact:
   \[
   (x y^4) \, dx + ((2x^2 + 3y^2 - 20)y^3) \, dy = 0
   \]

5. Solve the new exact equation by finding a potential function \( f(x, y) \):
   - Integrate \( M = x y^4 \) with respect to \( x \):
     \[
     f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^4 + g(y)
     \]
   - Differentiate with respect to \( y \) and equate to \( N \):
     \[
     2x^2y^3 + g'(y) = (2x^2 + 3y^2 - 20)y^3
     \]
   - Solve for \( g(y) \):
     \[
     g(y) = \frac{1}{2}y^6 - 5y^4 + C_1
     \]

6. The solution is:
   \[
   f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2y^4 + \frac{1}{2}y^6 - 5y^4 = C
   \]
   This represents the family of solutions to the original differential equation.

The solver appreciates the elegance of finding an integrating factor that simplifies the problem into a solvable exact equation.
