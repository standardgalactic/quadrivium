The text provides an example of solving a differential equation using various techniques. The initial equation given is \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{xy}{20 - 2x^2 - 3y^2}\). 

1. **Separation of Variables:** Initially, the problem is identified as difficult to separate variables.

2. **Linear Equation:** It's determined that the equation cannot be written in a standard linear form with an integrating factor.

3. **Exact Equations:** The equation is transformed into \(xy \, dx + (20 - 2x^2 - 3y^2) \, dy = 0\) to check for exactness. 

4. **Integrating Factor:** Since the equation isn't exact, an integrating factor is sought. It turns out that a function of \(y\), specifically \(y^3\), can be used as an integrating factor.

5. **Exact Equation Achieved:** After multiplying through by this integrating factor, the transformed equation becomes exact.

6. **Solution Process:**
   - Integrate with respect to \(x\) to find part of the potential function.
   - Differentiate and integrate with respect to \(y\) to determine another part of the potential function.
   - Combine these results to express a solution implicitly as \(\frac{1}{2} x^2 y^4 + \frac{1}{2} y^6 - 5y^4 = C\), where \(C\) is a constant.

The process highlights finding an appropriate integrating factor to convert the differential equation into an exact form, allowing for integration and solution derivation.
