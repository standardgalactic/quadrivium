The text presents an explanation of how to derive Newton's third law from a symmetry principle, specifically translational invariance and homogeneous space. The approach involves using a thought experiment known as "virtual displacement" by d'Alembert, which examines the movement of a system of particles within such symmetrical conditions.

1. **Symmetry Principle**: The speaker introduces the idea that certain laws of nature, including Newton's laws, can be derived from symmetry principles rather than being accepted axiomatically. Here, translational invariance is highlighted as the key principle: moving an object or a system without changing its internal structure should not alter any properties.

2. **Thought Experiment**: The speaker imagines moving a closed system of particles instantaneously from one point to another (a virtual displacement) and notes that no external work is done during this movement, leading to a net force of zero within the system.

3. **Derivation of Newton's Third Law**:
   - Since the total internal forces must sum to zero for translational invariance to hold true, it implies that for every action (force exerted by one particle on another), there is an equal and opposite reaction (the second particle exerts a force back).
   
4. **Connection with Newton's Laws**: By accepting Newton’s second law (force equals the rate of change of momentum) as valid, the speaker shows how it leads to the conservation of momentum in a system. Specifically, for a two-particle system, this results in the conservation of linear momentum.

5. **Conclusion**: The text concludes by linking translational invariance and homogeneous space with the conservation of momentum, illustrating that these symmetry principles naturally lead to Newton's third law.

This approach demonstrates how fundamental physics laws can be understood through the lens of symmetries and conservation principles.

The text discusses a two-particle system using concepts from classical mechanics, particularly focusing on conservation laws and Newton's laws of motion. It begins with an equation for total momentum \( dp \) as the sum of individual momenta changes over time (\( dt \)). Using properties of derivatives, it shows that the rate of change of total momentum is zero, indicating conservation of momentum.

The key point made is that if one particle experiences a force, the other must experience an equal and opposite force (implying Newton's third law). The discussion starts with a symmetry principle leading to a conserved quantity—linear momentum. It highlights how this stems from virtual displacement in thought experiments and aligns with Newton’s second and first laws.

The text implies that through these principles, one can deduce that the change in linear momentum must be zero for it to remain constant, emphasizing its conservation due to underlying symmetry in the system. This understanding derives Newton's third law as a consequence of these symmetries and conservation principles.

The text describes a process involving a two-particle system. By taking the derivative with respect to time (ddt) on both sides of an equation, and rearranging terms, it is shown that the result equals zero. This manipulation leads to a formulation consistent with Newton's Third Law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In this context, the mathematical derivation supports the principle that forces between two interacting particles are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
