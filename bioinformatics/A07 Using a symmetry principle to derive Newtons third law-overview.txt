The text presents an explanation of how to derive Newton's third law from a symmetry principle, specifically translational invariance and homogeneous space. The approach involves using a thought experiment known as "virtual displacement" by d'Alembert, which examines the movement of a system of particles within such symmetrical conditions.

1. **Symmetry Principle**: The speaker introduces the idea that certain laws of nature, including Newton's laws, can be derived from symmetry principles rather than being accepted axiomatically. Here, translational invariance is highlighted as the key principle: moving an object or a system without changing its internal structure should not alter any properties.

2. **Thought Experiment**: The speaker imagines moving a closed system of particles instantaneously from one point to another (a virtual displacement) and notes that no external work is done during this movement, leading to a net force of zero within the system.

3. **Derivation of Newton's Third Law**:
   - Since the total internal forces must sum to zero for translational invariance to hold true, it implies that for every action (force exerted by one particle on another), there is an equal and opposite reaction (the second particle exerts a force back).
   
4. **Connection with Newton's Laws**: By accepting Newton’s second law (force equals the rate of change of momentum) as valid, the speaker shows how it leads to the conservation of momentum in a system. Specifically, for a two-particle system, this results in the conservation of linear momentum.

5. **Conclusion**: The text concludes by linking translational invariance and homogeneous space with the conservation of momentum, illustrating that these symmetry principles naturally lead to Newton's third law.

This approach demonstrates how fundamental physics laws can be understood through the lens of symmetries and conservation principles.

The text discusses a two-particle system using concepts from classical mechanics, particularly focusing on conservation laws and Newton's laws of motion. It begins with an equation for total momentum \( dp \) as the sum of individual momenta changes over time (\( dt \)). Using properties of derivatives, it shows that the rate of change of total momentum is zero, indicating conservation of momentum.

The key point made is that if one particle experiences a force, the other must experience an equal and opposite force (implying Newton's third law). The discussion starts with a symmetry principle leading to a conserved quantity—linear momentum. It highlights how this stems from virtual displacement in thought experiments and aligns with Newton’s second and first laws.

The text implies that through these principles, one can deduce that the change in linear momentum must be zero for it to remain constant, emphasizing its conservation due to underlying symmetry in the system. This understanding derives Newton's third law as a consequence of these symmetries and conservation principles.

The text describes a process involving a two-particle system. By taking the derivative with respect to time (ddt) on both sides of an equation, and rearranging terms, it is shown that the result equals zero. This manipulation leads to a formulation consistent with Newton's Third Law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In this context, the mathematical derivation supports the principle that forces between two interacting particles are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The text presents an explanation of how to derive Newton's third law from a symmetry principle using the concept of virtual displacement by d'Alembert. It emphasizes thinking in terms of symmetries, as inspired by Einstein’s methodologies since 1905, starting with accepting Newton’s second and first laws as foundational truths.

1. **Symmetry Principle**: The principle explored is translational invariance within a homogeneous space, meaning the properties of a system remain unchanged when moved from one location to another without altering inter-particle distances or relative positions.

2. **Virtual Displacement Thought Experiment**: This involves imagining moving an isolated system of particles (in a closed system with no external forces) instantaneously and ideally from point A to B. The work done during this virtual displacement is zero, leading to the conclusion that the sum of internal forces must equal zero for translational invariance.

3. **Conservation Laws**: By applying Newton’s second law (\(f = \frac{dp}{dt}\)), it follows that if the derivative of total momentum \(p\) (considering all particles) is zero, then total momentum is conserved. This principle is illustrated with a two-particle system showing conservation of linear momentum.

4. **Deriving Newton’s Third Law**: The necessity for internal forces to cancel out (\(\sum \mathbf{F} = 0\)) leads to the conclusion that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, essentially deriving Newton's third law from symmetry considerations.

Overall, this approach uses symmetry principles to establish fundamental physics laws, demonstrating how translational invariance results in conservation of momentum.

The text discusses a two-particle system and explores the conservation of linear momentum using Newton's laws. The main point revolves around showing that for a closed system, the total linear momentum remains constant over time. 

Here's a summary:

1. **Total Linear Momentum (dp):** The text starts with the concept of total linear momentum, \( dp \), which is the sum of the momenta of two particles (\( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \)).

2. **Time Derivative:** It considers the time derivative of this total momentum, showing that:

   \[
   \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{dp_1}{dt} + \frac{dp_2}{dt}
   \]

3. **Conservation Law:** The text establishes that for the rate of change of total linear momentum to be zero (\(\frac{dp}{dt} = 0\)), it follows that:

   \[
   \frac{dp_1}{dt} = -\frac{dp_2}{dt}
   \]

4. **Newton's Third Law:** This relationship implies Newton’s third law of motion, where the force exerted by one particle on another is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

5. **Symmetry Principle:** The discussion highlights a symmetry principle leading to conservation laws. Specifically, linear momentum is conserved due to this underlying symmetry.

6. **Implications:** By using Newton's second law (and implicitly his first law), the text demonstrates that if the rate of change of linear momentum is zero, then the total momentum must be constant over time.

Overall, the passage illustrates how conservation laws arise from symmetry principles and are fundamental in understanding the dynamics of particle systems.

The text describes a process involving a two-particle system. By taking the time derivative (denoted as ddt) of both sides of an equation describing this system, one finds that the result equals zero when rearranged. This leads to the expression for force \( f \), illustrating Newton's third law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Essentially, it shows how forces between two particles are related through this principle.
