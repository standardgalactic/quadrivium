What should happen after this section of videos on series is there are a few series that you
should actually memorize and know immediately if they're convergent or divergent and maybe
in the end I'll just put them all together. So the next one we're going to look at and we're
also going to use the integral test for the convergence of a series is this one over k
to the power p and I want to know for what values of p is this series convergent? Is this series
convergent? Now we've already looked at one of them and that is when p was 1. When p
equals 1 that gave us what we call the harmonic series. Look at that video again and you'll
note that the harmonic series is divergent. It was divergent. So for p equals 1 the series
is divergent and that was called the harmonic series. 1 over k. Remember that was called
harmonic series. Now let's look at what happens I think now when p is less than 1. When p is
less than 1 let's just rewrite this. That means k to the power negative p and then there's the
sum p equals 1 to infinity. Let's let p equal less than 1. What is less than 1? Let's use 0. So let's
use p equals 0. What's going to happen? When p equals 0 anything to the power 0 is 1. So that will be
the first 1 to the power 0. 1 to the power 0 is 1 plus. 2 to the power 0 is 1 plus. 3 to the power 0
is 1 plus. And we can very quickly see that this diverges. That this diverges. Let's use p equal to
negative 1. p equal to negative 1. Negative times negative 1 is positive 1. So we're going to get
negative 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4. And we can quickly see that both of these, you know, it's just two
examples. But clearly when p is less than 1 this series diverges. So the only hope of p to converge
would be for p greater than 1 because now we've already shown that for p less than or equal to 1
the series diverges. It diverges. Let's do p is larger than 1. Let's use the integral test. First of all we
need to see can we use the integral test. So can this be written? Can this be written as a function?
So can I have the f of k equals a of k, a k? Indeed I can. Indeed I can. And as much as I'm going to have the f of x
equal to f of x equal to 1 over x to the power of p that equals x to the power negative p. Now p, remember always
always we are dealing with p's larger than 1. Is this continuous, this function? Yes. No matter what
value of x I get, I will get in a y value. y equals x to the power negative p for any positive p or p larger
than 1. I can put negative of a million, zero, one, ten million. It doesn't matter if you put any value of x,
it's continuous. Now I need to find out, does it always decrease as x goes to infinity? And to do that
I need to take the first derivative of x. That is going to be negative p times x to the power negative p
minus 1. Negative p, um, do I have that? Negative p minus 1. Okay, so that is going to equal, I can also write
that as negative p, x to the power negative p plus 1. I've just taken the negative out there and that is
nothing but negative p over x to the power p plus 1. Now my denominator, remember p is larger,
than 1. So my numerator is always negative. So for me to get a negative value, I need this to be less
than zero. I need a negative value. My denominator has to be positive. And when will my denominator be
positive? Remember p is larger than 1. Well, it can't be zero because zero to the power of anything
is zero. I can't divide by zero. If it is negative, negative something, well that depends. If p is 1,
I've got negative, you know, x squared. But so for me to be 100% sure that I do get, I need actually
for x to be larger than zero. Because p is already larger than 1. So my exponent there is always going
to be positive. And if my x value is larger than 1, if my x value is larger than 1, I'm always going to
have, I'm always going to have a positive denominator. So that will be, so that will give me a negative,
that will give me a negative first derivative. In other words, my slope is always decreasing.
So as we go towards infinity, my slope always decreases. And it is continuous there. In other words,
I can now use the integral test. In other words, I'm going to integrate this term. And if it converges,
my series converges. And if it diverges, my series diverges. We're giving for p larger than 1. So let's
take the integral from zero. I think most of the books will use 1 there. And we will use greater than
or equal to 1. But let's use 0 to infinity, which you remember then becomes the limit as r goes to
infinity of 0 to r of x to the power negative p dx. x to 1 over x to the power p, 1 over x to the power p,
all that. So that becomes the limit as r goes to infinity of
veut for x to the power r. x to the power
of x to the power r. x to the power p plus 1, going from 0 to r.
Now these, it's minus p plus 1, so let's just write that as 1-p, 1-p.
minus p same goes for that one minus p so in actual fact that is just in the numerator
so x one minus p so that's what i what i have let's substitute this these values in so i'm
going to get the limit as r goes to infinity of you can put the r value in there r to the power
one minus p over one minus p minus minus then i've got to put zero in there immediately i have
zero in the numerator this becomes zero this becomes zero now i need to let r go to infinity
first of all you might think well r is in the numerator if i put infinity there it'll be
infinity minus zero not so remember p is larger than one p is larger than one this is going to be
one minus a value that's larger than one so this exponent is going to be a negative bringing this
r which becomes infinity into the denominator so this actually becomes a zero zero minus zero is zero
so this integral converges to zero because this is a convergent integral that means for any value p
larger than one any value of p larger than one this series diverges if p equals one it's the harmonic
series and it diverges if p is less than one it also diverges i've shown an example up there but if p is
larger than one this is larger than one the series converges for any value p for any value p larger than
one so if i have one over k squared because two is larger than one it converges and i think we looked
at those examples one over k cubed one over k to the power of a million okay those series converge
by uh by the fact that i used the integral test and the integral actually also converges and and first of
all i needed to make sure that i can write it as a function and that and as x goes to infinity then
it is continuous and it always decreases if if those things weren't true if i couldn't write it those in
f and f of x and it wasn't it wasn't continuous or it didn't always decrease there was some increase
then i could not use the integral test now in the previous section we looked at this series let's say we
had the sum of k equals one to infinity of one equal k to the power p now i call that the p series and we
showed if p is less than or equal to one it diverges and if p was larger than one it converges but that was the
called the p series remember that one and if p was one we call that the harmonic series the subtype
of the p series now to look at p equals larger than one to show that it converge i used the integral test
and i'm going to do the same thing here and we're going to talk about the remainder but it's my second
opportunity to show you the integral tests i'm going to be a lot more specific about the integral test so
we can memorize this which become part of memory i have a series so even though i'm going to talk about
the remainder i'm going to go again through the properties of the of the integral test and when
you can apply the integral test so i have a series here very simply going from k equals one to infinity
if i take a partial sum so that this means it's going to go from k equals one to n a k so that whole
series is going to infinity the sequence of or you know the infinite sum i'm only taking a partial sum
so what remains is called the remainder so if i take s and i subtract that goes to infinity minus s of n
i'm left with this remainder and what is that remainder well this is the sum from k equals one to
infinity of a k minus this is the sum going from k equals one to n of a k what what is what remains
well this is the sum from k equals n plus one so i only went to k equals n so now i've got to start
that n equals k equals n plus one if i bring this negative to this side that means i'm going from k
equals one to n and then from n1 to infinity which will bring me here okay okay that is called that is
called the remainder now i can calculate this remainder but at least i can see where it belongs and for that i
need to look at the again the integral test now the integral test says suppose i have my series there and
suppose that the f of k equals 8k for all k for all k equals one comma two comma three comma four
this is there's nothing magical about that statement this is there's nothing magical about that statement
it just says i can write this as if as an f of x now suppose i can do that and i've just given a
very simple thing a to a k can be written as a function and suppose that that function is continuous
f must be continuous
and decreasing always decreasing it cannot increase as x goes to infinity okay it is always decreasing and
so one suppose i can write it like that and it is continuous f must be continuous and decreasing as
f goes to infinity and the thing and i don't think we mentioned it when we just talked about the p series
it must f must be positive it must be positive for all x for all x greater than or equal to one
okay for all x greater than or equal to one and the integral in bearing from one now remember i used
zero in the p this one and still showed the light converge to l and l was zero for me but this is this
is the proper way of doing from one to infinity from one to infinity of to f of x dx dx dx now we said
if if all of these were true then i could do this and if it converged my series converges if it diverges
my series diverges okay but what i'm now saying is if this converges if this converges then then
zero is smaller than or equal to the r of n which is this k equals n plus one k equals n plus one to
uh infinity and that is greater than and less than and equal to i'm going from n to infinity of the f of x dx
okay so there's a method for me to establish this remainder but for me to use this to calculate the
remainder so that i know that the remainder is then going to be between zero and this and look here
now going from n to infinity for me to do that i need for i need to be able to apply the integral test
and the integral test is i must be able to write the f of k equals this the f of k equals this so if i put an
x in there the f of x is a x it's going to equal i've got the f of x you say so i'm writing this the f of
x equals a x if i put in k here i put in k there and this has got to equal exactly that it's got to
equal exactly that and i can do it here and suppose now if it's continuous and it must be continuous and
equal as x goes to infinity and it must be positive okay otherwise we're dealing with negative areas
under the curve for the integral we can't do that it must be positive for all x at least for the x is
greater than or equal to one then the integral going from one to infinity the improper integral
so i've got to use the limit as r goes to infinity and plug in r there of f of x dx if it converges
the series converges if it diverges the series diverges but now if it converges then i can use
this statement here to look at the remainder
