So when it comes to making notes for studying mathematics, I love to do it in a notebook
environment and by that I mean a computational workbook environment. So I'm either going to use
Julia or Python or the Warframe language and I'm going to use the IDEs for any one of those and
I'm going to create a notebook because that allows me to make beautiful type text and also use some
code to help me understand or do the problems, just understand what is going on with the
mathematics. So it's really wonderful for me to have those notebooks. It's really neat to have
them as opposed to my terrible handwriting. So as much as I like a thick pencil like a 6B and as
much as I like a chalkboard, really when it comes to the notes I love them to look nice and so I'm
going to create a computer generated notebook and in that we're going to have some LaTeX code so we
have this nice expression of mathematical notation. But more importantly we're going to have some code
as well because I really don't believe that you should study mathematics any longer without having
some code there as well. It really helps an understanding of it. It really helps you to
check your work. It just brings a new and a deeper level of understanding as far as the mathematics is
concerned. So in this notebook I'm going to just introduce you to complex numbers if you've never seen
them before and what we're going to use is a Pluto notebook and we're going to write some Julia code as
well. So have a look at this and see if you like it. At least you'll get a good introduction to
complex numbers. Here we are in a Pluto notebook. As you can see everything's already typed out so you
don't have to watch me type. So we're talking about complex numbers and you can see here in equation 1
the natural numbers are a subset of the integers which are a subset of the rational numbers which are a
subset of the reals and the real numbers, the real number line, that is really a subset of the
complex numbers. So we're just expanding this set of the real numbers to get to the complex numbers.
Now this notebook is within a Julia environment and that Julia environment was described at least
in this project.toml file and so I'm saving the address to this toml file as a string and I'm just
saving that in a computer variable called file and then we're going to type using pkg so we're going
to use the Julia package manager and then the pkg.activate function and we activate this file or this
project.toml file. So all the packages that I've installed within this environment will now be
available inside of this notebook and we're running that specific environment, Julia environment. So if
you want to know how to do this, how to set up that environment and use it inside of Pluto, the link to my
video on that is in the description down below. So we're also going to use three other libraries, packages,
and the first one is plots. So using plots as well and then plotly is going to be our back end. That is the
back end I use most often because it produces lovely interactive plots. We're also going to use Pluto UI
just so that I can show you a bit of this user interface, Pluto user interface and then one of the
inbuilt packages when you install Julia for the first time would be linear algebra and we're going to
certainly use that as well. So in case you're not familiar with Pluto notebooks, remember all of
these things are cells. If I hover over the cell you can see that I can create a cell above that by
clicking the plus symbol up there or the plus symbol down here. It's going to add a symbol and you see
the little eyeball there with a line through it which means it's showing or hiding the code. At the
moment it's hidden. So let's show the code and then you can see there. So with Pluto remember of course
always the code is underneath the execution of that cell is on top. So I'm just writing MD and then in
quotation marks. So this denotes the cell as a markdown cell and I'm using a single hash tag symbol
there or pound symbol and that means it's going to be rendered as an h1 level tag, html tag that is the
largest text just as far as normal text is concerned. So I'm using that as my title as my title and I can just
hide that. So it'll make this nice line underneath as well. So just for normal text cell again it's all
marked down MD and everything goes into a single pair of quotation marks and you'll see how to express LARTECH.
There you'll see a bit of LARTECH code within dollar symbols. That's backslash math BB and then the C
within curly braces and that's going to give us this double struck C denoting the set of all complex
numbers. You see this bold here that's just two underscores before and under before and after
some text and that's going to give you bold. Remember single ones would be italic
LARTECH and then this would all just be LARTECH. So again it's just denoting as markdown opening
closing quotation marks and then my whole set of the LARTECH code there to have this rendered to the
screen. And as I would always say that's why I love making my notes inside of some computer language
IDE so that we can have these nice lovely neat notes and I just my my mind at least responds to
that. Now the imaginary number i it's mostly how it's denoted in mathematics although the engineers
use the j symbol for that. But here we see an equation to the imaginary number which is a horrible
horrible name because there's nothing imaginary about it. So one of the first things you must do
in complex analysis is just put out of your head that this this is somehow imaginary. It's not imaginary
at all. It's just a poor choice of name but it is stuck. There's been various other suggestions but
this term just just stuck. But anyway we see the imagined number i there and its property.
It is a number such that if you square it you get negative one. That's what it is. Now we were taught
at school that if you square anything it's going to be either zero if the thing that you're squaring
is zero or positive everything else even a negative number. But that refers to the set of real numbers.
We're expanding on them now. We're now in the world of complex numbers of which real numbers are just
apart. So indeed there would be numbers that we can square to get a negative value.
And that number is indeed i. If you square it you get negative one. In Julia to use this value
this element inside of the set of complex numbers the keyword for that is im short for imagining number.
If you type im you'll see im is expressed in the code as you see above there. So we haven't looked
at what a complex number is but the expression here the expression of the code here im squared. Remember
to get a square it's the caret symbol or shift six on most keyboards. So I'm writing im and then
caret symbol two that would be i squared and I get this negative one plus zero times the imaginary number.
So zero times anything even a complex number is still going to be zero. So what we left here with
actually it's just negative one. So i squared is indeed negative one according to the code at least.
So let's look at this idea of a complex number. We see a complex number there in equation three.
z equals a plus bi. And a common alternative which we will probably use most often in this notebook is
x plus iy. You know you just see bi and then iy. It's just the other way around. There's a commutative
property there. So it doesn't matter which way around you write it. But it's common if you use x and y is
that you write iy. And if you use anything else it's anything else i. So bi. Now what is this a and b and x and y?
They're just two x and y. They're just two real numbers. Both elements are the real numbers. The x or the a
that is called the real part of this imaginary or this complex number z. And y or b those are the imaginary parts.
So the real part x and a and the imaginary part this b or y. And we usually denote that as you can see
here re of z and the im of z re of z im of z. So that is a complex number. In some text you'll also see
this notation. Just wanted to show you that z equals a comma b. That's still the real and imaginary parts
of this complex number. Now i promise i'm going to show you just a little bit of why i one of
the reasons why i think people like pluto is the pluto ui. They can do this with without the macro
code but since we've imported that package pluto ui we can just use the macro at bind and then we're
going to have a variable called a and what we want that variable to be is the value of a slider object.
So slider and i'm using unit ranger negative five to five and because we're not using a step size there
the default step size will be one so it'll be negative five negative four negative three all
the way to three four five. And that gets expressed as a slider there and we see we do the same thing
for b and i can drag the slider and it's going to give me different values because let me move it up
see what's happening down here. So the thing about a pluto notebook everything is live so wherever i change
some code if it's if a variable is involved in another cell that's going to update at the same time.
So i've created this imaginary number here or this complex number z1 and i said it's a plus bi
and that a is a computer variable and we've created it up there so at the moment both a and b
according to the sliders are negative five so our complex number at the moment is negative five
minus five i and as i drag say the a you see that updates immediately that updates immediately
in three and four and five there we go now it's five minus five im or five plus four im
so it's as simple as that and you can well imagine i suppose a couple of uses of just these sliders and
more than just the slide objects and pluto ui so give it a give it a look now there are three functions
inside of julia that are useful when it comes to these complex numbers the first one is real so if
i pass in a complex number as an argument to the real functions it's going to give me the real part
back and again as i drag the slider you'll see my number updates it's now one plus four im so the real
part is one and then imag for imaginary pass the complex number as an argument and we can see that
or you can return it as a tuple using the reim function reim function and it's going to give
you a tuple back of the real and imaginary parts so that's very simple now one thing we wanted to do in
this section is just a bit of simple uh simple arithmetic so let's create two complex numbers
we're going to have z1 and z2 and if we see in the equation three so they've each got their own
real part and imaginary part if i add them well we just you know we've added the z1 z plus z sub 1 z
sub 2 on the left hand side so we're just going to add these two things on the right hand side so
that'll be x sub 1 plus i y sub 1 plus x sub 2 plus i y sub 2 and all we're going to do now is
we're just going to group the real and imaginary parts so we see if we add two complex numbers we're
just going to add the real parts and we add the imaginary parts and the imaginary parts just get
multiplied by i as simple as that so let's just have a look at this we're going to create a
second complex number z2 remember z1 is still going to be bound to those two sliders at the moment
for me it's 1 plus 4im i'm going to create z2 that's 3 minus 3im and then i'm going to say z1
plus z2 so at the moment my real parts are 1 and 3 3 plus 1 is 4 and 4 and minus 3 that's 1 so indeed
the solution would be 4 plus 1i so very very simple indeed more of more interest let's look at
multiplication and we're going to do it the same as we did with algebra if we have x a plus b times
m plus n whatever we're just going to multiply it out by those rules that you learned at school
so here we have let's look at the top here z1 times z2 so that's x sub 1 plus y i y sub 1 times x sub 2
plus i y sub 2 so x sub 1 times the x sub 2 it goes in the second line then x sub 1 times i y sub 2 so
there'll be i x sub 1 y sub 2 plus then the i y sub 1 times the x sub 2 just rearranging things so it
looks neat so there'll be i x sub 2 y sub 1 and in the end we'll have a plus i squared y1 y2 and all
we're going to do now we're going to group the real and imaginary parts and we're also going to remember
that this very last expression i squared y1 y2 is actually a real number because i squared is minus
1 so we're going to have x sub 1 y sub x sub 1 x sub 2 minus y sub 1 y sub 2 plus then i multiplied by
the expression as you can see there so very very easy no problems whatsoever let's just look at an
example i have z sub 3 and z sub 4 there z sub 3 being 2 plus 3i and z sub 4 being negative 2 minus i
so if i multiply these out the real part is going to be 2 times negative 2 that's negative 4
and then at the end it's going to be 3 times negative 1 that's negative 3 and i squared which
is negative 1 so that gives us a positive 3 so it's minus 4 positive 3 which leaves us with a negative 1
and then the i's are going to be a 2i and a negative 2i and a negative 6i that gives us negative 8i
so there we created in code and if we multiply that out indeed we get negative 1 minus 8i
no problems whatsoever so write yourself out some and just test test it by writing writing some code
now we're supposed to get to division but of course division is not going to work for us we'll have to
define or make it or create a definition for for division of complex numbers and to do that we first
have to introduce this notion of a complex conjugate so if a complex conjugate as you can see here z bar
the bar over the top sometimes there's a superscript asterisk but let's use the common
notation which is the bar over the z of a complex number z that's defined in equation 6.
so if z equals x plus iy then z bar is x minus iy so all we're going to do we're going to flip the sign
on the imaginary part or at least multiply it by the real number negative one so remember what z4 was
z4 was negative 2 minus i and if i take the conjugate of that complex conjugate of which
the function is just conj of z4 i get negative 2 plus one i there because negative one if we flip the
sign or multiply it by negative one it becomes a positive so it's the complex conjugate so for
interest's sake let's just see what happens if we multiply a complex number by its complex conjugate
and you can see there very quickly that we're going to end up because these i's on their own they're
going to cancel out minus ixy plus ixy they cancel out i squared is a negative one and that becomes times
this negatives of positive so we get x squared plus y squared so we have the fact that a complex
number times its complex conjugate gives us a real number so there's a little example for you we take
z4 and we're just going to multiply it by its complex conjugate z4 so that leaves us with 5 and you
can check on the result there that will be z4 times the conjugate of z4 and that gives us 5 because it's
a real number because we have 0im so now we can find to find division and this is what we what we're
going to do if we have two complex numbers z1 and z sub 2 such that z sub 2 is not 0 it's not 0 plus 0i
we can then we can do division and what we do is we multiply by the complex conjugate of the
denominator over the complex conjugate of the denominator and still in complex analysis dividing
a complex number by itself that just gives you 1 anything divided by itself is 1 except of course
for 0 dividing by 0 is not defined so if i have x plus x sub 1 plus i y sub 1 that's my z sub 1 divided
by x sub 2 plus i y sub 2 i'm going to multiply it just by the denominator's complex conjugate
over itself and that's what you're going to get write the bottom expression here in equation 9
that the at least the denominator is a real number and then the numerator is still going to be a complex
number
and now as you can see in the last expression last equation here in or last line in equation 1
the denominator is a real number and the numerator is still going to be a complex number so let's have
this little example of z5 and z6 and you can see 3 minus 3i is z sub 6 so we're going to multiply by 3
plus 3i divided by 3 plus 3i and then the denominator becomes a real number and the numerator is a complex
number and we can again just check that out with code creating z5 creating z6 and saying z5 divided by z6
and gives us this negative 0.166 all the way plus 1 plus 6 6 all the way i and just to show you if i
take the solution here negative 3 plus 21i divided by 18 i get exactly the same result so that is indeed
the numerical representation or an approximation of the of the fraction there that we see as far as this
is concerned you could also write it negative 3 over 18 plus 21 over 18i
so that brings us neatly into this idea of you know we have this real number line so we how do we
visualize this extension to the complex numbers seeing that the real numbers is a subset of the
complex numbers well the real line we still have and then this diagram which is called the argant diagram
we see here in orange that's the real axis with all the real numbers but perpendicular to that we
create another axis we call that the imaginary axis just as we had an x and a y axis but in cartesian
coordinates remember both the x-axis and the y-axis they're independent they're just independent real real
number lines here we and and if we have any if we have any point on the cartesian plane that refers to
two real numbers and usually remember write that in parentheses and there's one number the number the
x comma y value of that point but this is not what we have here we have the real part and the imaginary part
so if we have a complex number now we can plot it on this i again diagram based on its real value and
its imagine its real part and its imaginary part because both of those are real numbers and that's
exactly what happens here so we can see the value one comma one here so on the real number that we won
on the imaginary axis that'd be one so that's our very that's our complex number there one plus i
and here's another complex number that's two negative one so it's two minus i but you can also see
something else we can also view these things of course as vectors if we have the origin of the vector
or here at the origin and then the vector extends to the complex number because if you think about that
this allows us you know rich understanding of complex numbers through a bit of geometry
and we have this idea of right triangles because if this is the number one comma one that means this
length on the x-axis is one the length on this imaginary axis is one we have a right angle triangle so we
can have this notion of the length of this complex number or the length of this vector and we do
indeed talk about the length of a complex number it's called the modulus and we'll get to that and
there's also this angle that the vector makes with the positive x-axis or the positive real axis we should
say so there's a lovely geometry and trigonometry involved here with these complex numbers if we view them
as these points on the argand diagram or the complex plane in any way there's the word of code and as i
said that's why i like the plotly back end for plots because we can now we have this interactive
idea of this interaction at least and we can zoom in and now we really zoomed in and then we can just
go back home etc or just save this image as a png file so let's look at this idea of the magnitude
of a complex number but you've seen here now it's not it's going to be nothing other than
than just pythagorean theorem basically because that complex number would just be the hypotenuse
of a right angle triangle nothing nothing other than that so this magnitude of a complex number we call
it a modulus as you can see here we define it here in equation 10 and we write it with these straight
lines around the complex number and that would be positive the square root of x squared plus y squared
and remember how we got x squared plus y squared yeah that was just the complex number divided by
multiplied by its complex conjugate and we take the square root of that and what you can see the x squared
plus y squared square root of that again that just hops back to the pythagorean theorem doesn't it so
it all binds lovely nicely together and of course we're only interested in the positive part because
we're interested in the length of this thing so if we have z sub 5 remember that was 3 plus 4i
so that's going to be 3 squared plus 4 squared that's 25 and the square root is 25 is 5 and that's
what we would expect from a right triangle with a base of 3 and a height of 4 no problem there
and there we do it we say the square root of the real part of z5 squared plus the imaginary part of
z5 squared take the square root of all of that we get 5 or we take the square root of z multiplied by
its complex conjugate same story and then there's also the abs function for absolute and that's going
to give us the modulus if we pass as argument a complex number so there'll be three ways for you there
to calculate the modulus of the complex number so now that we know what the length is we can suppose
also look at that angle that it makes with the comp with the positive real axis and we call that
angle theta most of the time and remember if we go around and this two pi radians or 360 degrees
from the positive real axis counterclockwise all the way around there's nothing stopping us there's
no barrier there we can just go around and around and around and every time we add 360 degrees or two
pi radians so that first time we go before we go around twice that angle that first time round
anywhere would be what we call the principal argument and if you study a bit of complex
analysis you know we'll go beyond the principal argument and through just right angle triangle
trigonometry it's very easy to see that this angle is going to be the arc tangent of the complex
part divided by the real part it's just a simple right angle triangle taking the tangent of that
angle tangent remembers opposite divided by adjacent you already know the opposite and adjacent side
because that's the real and imaginary parts so opposite being y that's the imaginary part divided by
x and that is going to be the real part and there just went to sake i'll show you the arc tangent
function there's the code to do the arc tangent function and so there we go so let's take this
z sub seven it's one plus square root of three and i want for this example i want this to be expressed
this angle and to express in degrees so in radians at least that's going to be the arc tangent of
square root of three over one the imaginary part divided by the real part and the arc tangent of
square root of three well that's just going to leave us as far as degrees are concerned at a 60 degree
angle remember that's counterclockwise we're dealing with the first quadrant here with the number one
plus one is positive square root of three is positive so that's going to be in the first quadrant
of the argand diagram or complex plane and that's going to be 60 degrees so if we do this z
one as one plus the square root of three times i and we take the arc tangent of the imaginary part
divided by the real part which you can see there a tan is the arc tangent function or the inverse
tangent function and i wrap that all in the red two degree function which is going to take radians as
input and output degrees and by the um the round off error we see that indeed the solution is 60 degrees
i can also wrap all of that in the round function and that's just going to round it
to that integer which is which is 60 degrees and imagine then we just have
what i what we should go through at least is just just considering all four of the quadrants in the
arc-end diagram so we're going to keep things very simple we start with our first one z equals one plus i
so it's one down the real axis one up the imaginary axis makes a nice pi over four a principal argument
going counterclockwise from the positive imagine a positive real axis and if we do that we can use the
angle function so instead of here we had the arc tangent of the imaginary part divided by the real part
there's also i should have said there the angle function that's going to do exactly the same thing for us
so we can take the angle of one plus im and we wrap that in radians two degrees and we see we
get the solution of up here 45 just as we would expect now if we go to the second quadrant so that
is going to be negative on the real axis but still positive on the imaginary axis so minus one plus i
you can really visualize in your head where this is going to be otherwise just create a little graph
as we did up there just copy and paste that and change it a bit and that gives us as we would
expect 135 degrees because it's counting the angles from the positive real axis counterclockwise
till we get to this complex number vector representation and if we then go to the third quadrant
so there'll be both negative on the real part and the imaginary parts and minus one minus i
we see we get an angle of negative 135 and this is by design so in the third and fourth quadrants
we're going to go from the positive real axis clockwise so going down and then to the left and
that's how we get to 135 but it's now minus 135 and then the fourth quadrant which will be something
like one minus im or any representative number in that complex number in that quadrant i'm just choosing
easy ones we see an angle of negative 45 degrees so in those two quadrants it's going to go clockwise
downwards from the positive real axis and we get these negative values but as i said we can keep going
so a number like one plus i although it has a principal argument of pi over four radians of 45 degrees
we can add go around another two pi radians or 360 degrees so we'll be pi over four plus another two pi
that's nine over four pi if you add those two and if we pass that to the tangent function and round it
we see we still get this value of one so if we take the arc tangent of one
radians two degrees we get 45 we get 45 degrees so even though we've gone around more than once
it still ends up we're going to end up with the same angle the same angle it's going to repeat
and repeat and repeat if you think about the way that the tangent function works
so that's the geometry and trigonometry just an introduction to that as far as complex numbers
concerned and it's really intuitive so let's get to oiler's equation and that's very nice because
now we're going to use still more trigonometry and we're going to gain an even deeper insight into
this idea of a complex number and the argand diagram because if you look at the cosine let's just imagine
the first quadrant so there's this nice little vector that goes out into the first quadrant so a
complex number in the first quadrant and you take the cosine of that angle that it makes the positive
real positive real axis and the cosine it's just adjacent divided by hypotenuse and if we make this
hypotenuse r or the length the modulus of our complex number then we make that r so the cosine of the
angles is going to be x that is the real part the length of the real part divided by this hypotenuse
that means we get another expression for this real part it is the modulus times the cosine of the
principle argument that's a mouthful but it's easy to see there and the sine of that angle of that
complex number is just going to be the modulus times the sine of that angle that would be y
y is going to be or at least the imaginary part we should be clear just look at that equation 12
so the imaginary part is the modulus times the sine of the argument and the real part is the modulus
times the cosine of that angle the principal angle now let's just check we just said well the
pythagorean theorem works for us but we can also just sort of derive it here if we use the trigonometric
identity that the cosine squared of an angle plus the sine squared of an angle or the sine squared of that
angle plus the cosine squared of that angle that's just one because if i now use this new way of
writing the real and imaginary parts being r cosine theta and r sine theta if i have x squared plus y
squared that is going to be r squared cosine squared of theta plus r squared sine squared of theta i take
the r squared out as a common factor and i have this cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta which
according to the most well known i suppose the one you learn first the trigonometric identity you
learn about first that's just one so x squared plus y squared is r squared or r equals positive the
square root of x squared plus y squared so it's a no-brainer there so let's take this equation 14
and i'm rewriting x plus i y my x is now r cosine theta my y is r sine theta and i have this i
i see that i can take out r as a common factor so i have this brand new way of writing any complex
number it's the modulus times the sum of the cosine of the principle argument plus i times the sine of
the principle argument that's great so from there we're going to make this little big jump here in
equation 15 because what we're going to start off with is just a serious expansion this approximation of
the cosine of the cosine of an angle and the sine of an angle and you'll remember that from first year
calculus this series expansion of the cosine of an angle and the sine of an angle and you see them
written out there except for the sine of angle on the left hand side with multiplied by i which means
every little expression component on the right hand side has to be multiplied by i as well
and then you also see we take the exponent theta or oilers number to the power theta and you see the
series expansion there and now instead of just theta i'm going to say e to the power i theta so
everywhere where i see theta i replace that with i theta so all i'm doing on the left hand side so we're
doing it on the right hand side replacing theta with i theta and now it's very neat because all these
numerators have i squared in them then i cubed i to the power four and of course we can work all that
out i squared is negative one so we see this e to the power i theta that becomes one plus i theta and
then minus theta squared over two factorial so those exclamation marks is factorials and so i have this
series expansion of e to the power i theta and what i noticed that you know every second one is just a real
number and every other second one contains a complex number so let me just take out this
separate these two out so that i only have these real number expansion and then the expansion that
has i in it and what you'd notice there in these two final sections is that i have the series expansion
of cosine theta there and i have the series expansion of i sine theta on there on that side
so i can just substitute that back in so e to the i pi is cosine of theta plus i sine of theta that's
wonderful and if cosine of theta plus i sine of theta equals e to the i theta i can replace that in
this z equals r cosine of theta plus i sine of theta equation of ours that means i get this equation 16
euler's equation z equals r times e to the power i theta so i can write a complex number as
the modulus times euler's number to the power i times the principal argument that is wonderful and now
let's just do be very bold let's just pick a complex number that's on the unit circle so the modulus of
is one and we're going to on that on that circle we're going to choose pi radians now think a little
bit in your head or draw down paper if i have the complex plane and i have a principal argument of theta
radians that flops me counterclockwise all the way over to the negative real axis and i have a modulus
of one well that's just going to be the complex number negative one plus zero i or the real number
minus one that's all i have there and i have this fact then that e to the i pi if i then write it out
instead of thinking about the just the image in our head of of this argand diagram if we write this out
r is now one so that disappears cosine of pi plus i times the sine of pi
well we know from before that that is negative one so e to the i pi equals negative one or e to the i
pi plus one equals zero and that's just phenomenal this idea this connection this deep connection
between the oiler's number e and pi this is beautiful connection with the two such as if you
write it in this configuration e to the power i theta i should say e to the power i pi this is negative
one lovely stuff so this brings us then with a new way that we can multiply and divide two complex
numbers you see equation 18 and 19 there so equation 18 we're multiplying z sub 1 and z sub 2 and we're
writing it using this oilers using uh oilers form there r sub 1 e to the power i theta sub 1 times r sub 2
e to the power i theta sub 2 so we see that's all just four terms multiplied by each other so we can
just rearrange a little bit the commutative property so r sub 1 times r sub 2 times e and then with the
law of exponents remember if we multiply these two we can just add them and i've added them there in the
second line and i've taken i out as a common factor so with multiplication we multiply them to moduli
and we raise multiply that by i and use that in the exponentiation and then of course it becomes very
easy if we have if we're multiplying more than two complex numbers we'll just keep on multiplying the
moduli and we'll keep on adding the principal arguments no problem there and we see the division
there as long as z2 is not all zeros not zero plus zero i real and imagine parts can't be zero
we have this idea of dividing the two moduli and we subtract the second from the first as far as the
principal argument is concerned which brings us by this lovely theorem and i won't try and butcher
that name look it up on youtube or it's actually quite funny to see how many pronunciations they are
but if you go to google and just try and look for the official pronunciation it'll do a much better job
than me and this theorem is written in equation 20 it says if i take a complex number to any power
that is going to be the same as taking the real the modulus to that power
and this idea of the angle angle form so cosine of theta plus i sine of theta and i and i take that to
the power n and what we're suggesting that's the very same thing then the modulus to the power n
times cosine of n times theta plus i times n sine theta but somehow as if by magic i can bring that
the power into the angles as well now the proof of that is very simple we're going to prove it through
and prove it by mathematical induction simple induction so we're going to use the fact that the
cosine of the addition of two angles can be written as the cosine of the first angle times the cosine of
the second angle minus the sine of the first angle times the sine of the second angle and
um we also have this idea of if we add two angles and we take the sine of that that that's going to
be the cosine of the first angle sine of the second angle plus sine of the first angle cosine of the
second angle no problem so let's look at the base case n equals one so if i just put n equals one there
we have r cosine theta plus i sine of theta as far as z is concerned so we a okay there
for at least for one works if we if we say z to the power one and everything is to the power one and
it's one times theta and for cosine and one times theta for the sine i mean it just all works out for
base case one now we do this induction hypothesis we say we assume that the theorem is true for n equals
k and show that is true for k plus or n equals k plus one
so i have things there z to the power k we don't know what k is that's going to be r to the power k
as we've mentioned and then the cosine of k theta plus the sine of k theta times r cosine theta plus i
sine of theta because if we have z to the power k there and we say z to the power k plus one
that's all we do is we have z to the power k times z because if we have it you can see it right here
z to the power k it's not going to highlight for me but z to the power k times z well we just add the
the exponents so that we k plus one and on the right hand side you can see what it is it's to the
power r r to the power k we have this notion of multiplication of the angle as far as cosine and sine is
concerned and all of that we're just going to multiply by the modulus times r sine r cosine
of theta plus i sine of theta and you see there how we how we expand that and eventually we get
to this idea of r to the power k plus one equals indeed r to the power z to the power k plus one
equals r to the power k plus one times the cosine of k plus one theta plus i times k plus one theta
so if we assume that z to the power k is true we see that z to the power k plus one works out for us
as well and all the dominoes fall because we've assumed what one is true and we show that the next
one is true if we then start with the base case which we've shown to be true that means the next
one has to be true and if that one's true the next one has to be and all the dominoes fall
and that's mathematical induction so let's have a look at this idea then of taking the fourth
roots of a number one well now you didn't know there you didn't know before at least that there
actually four roots there's four numbers that you can multiply by itself four times that is going to
give you one so the fourth roots of one or we can just write it as one to the power quarter which
means n is a quarter it also means that r equals one theta is zero this is just one so it's this
dot on the real part of the complex plane the real axis and then we have this fact that remember that
if you take one and you raise it to any power except of course zero um well one to the power
zero is actually also just one isn't it and so that's just going to be one so we can simplify
that first line a little bit as well because if we write it out now it's going to be the cosine of
that angle plus i sine of that angle and because one to the power quarter is just one that becomes a
one in line two there and i have this idea of theta plus two k theta divided by four and theta plus
two k pi divided by four and you can see there the sequence of values for k this means you know the
fact that that theta equals zero so we can leave that out we are left with this k pi over two and k pi
over two as far as cosine and sine is concerned and if you start with k equals zero that's going to
be cosine of pi over two plus sine of pi over two and that just leaves us with one and if k equals one
two i should say or start with zero then one then two then three you see the four numbers that you get
there one i negative one negative i and if you take any of those values and you raise it to the power
four you're going to get the value one check it out for yourself now the last part of this notebook
is just revisiting the sine and cosine functions and what i do here in this last section that you
can read on your own that's very neatly typed out for you there is that we can rewrite complex numbers
or the cosine at least of an angle we can rewrite it as you can see in the equation two cosine of an
angle is e to the power i that angle plus e to the power negative i times that angle divided by two
and then the sine of an angle we can write like that and we just divide it by two i remember to get
rid of this complex part in the denominator we can multiply it by negative two i over negative two i
okay which brings us here by just euler's notation z to the power n remember that z to the power n that's
cosine n theta plus i n theta and if it's z to the power negative n remember the cosine function here
if you take the negative of a negative angle it's still just going to be the cosine of a positive angle
and then minus i times sine of n times theta
and if we add them there and we remember from equation 25 here when n equals one we get two
cosine theta from equation 23 and in the second form two i sine of theta and we can use this fact to
find some other expression say for instance in example seven cosine to the power four of theta
and we would just just this fact that we've just looked at now these equations up here 23 24 25 we
just use them so that we get this idea of cosine to the power four can be written as one over a times
cosine of four times that angle and it goes the other way around as well when we want to write
something as this power the power of these angles it's very easy to do as well and you can follow
the steps here in example eight and look at the code to verify that for yourself the last thing i want
you to read here as well as about the dot and the cross product and how to calculate them and what they
mean to us and you can see all the code there and then how to work out how to do this what you are
going to need as well is this idea of the determinant of taking this matrix and as far as the cross
product is concerned so you can certainly read through that and that's it that's your introduction
to complex numbers and we make very neat notes using a pluton notebook and we make life very easy for
ourselves look at here we write this cross and we take the cross product of these two complex numbers
3 plus 4i and 2 plus 4i and lo and behold we get this solution um right there 0 0 4 and you can read
why that is so why the cross product do we have the solution that is perpendicular to the argand diagram
that just brings us with two very important things to note when it comes to the dot and the cross
product if you take the dot product of two complex numbers and they are 0 the dot product 0 then it
means either it just really means that the two vectors that make up the complex numbers are
perpendicular to each other and if we take the magnitude of the cross product if that is 0 it
means these two values are perpendicular to each other so read this last part it's quite fascinating the
document cross product of complex numbers so learn how to write this bit of code how to do a bit of
latex just write normal english sentences in some of these code cells give it a go your work will be so much
neater you'll understand it better it looks good the solutions are very well written and as far as it's very
neat to do it to do your mathematics homework or at least your notes inside of a notebook environment
such as this i hope you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up subscribe to this channel that is the
most important thing i bring out a variety of educational resources it's just something that i love to do

official certificate from the university of cape town if you want to learn some julia so have a look
on coursera.org the biggest massive open online course platform in the world and look up julia for
scientific computing and you'll see the course there by myself and one of my colleagues in the
mathematics department andre lori and that's a fantastic course as well otherwise check out all
my videos here on youtube and learn about using julia and do your mathematics at least the numerical part
