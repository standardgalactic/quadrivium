The text discusses several problems related to atomic physics and nuclear properties:

1. **Area Ratio of Bismuth and Hydrogen Nuclei**: 
   - The task involves calculating the ratio of surface areas between bismuth (with an atomic mass number of 209) and hydrogen nuclei (atomic mass number of 1). Using the formula for the area of a sphere (\(4 \pi r^2\)), where \(r = 1.2 \times A^{1/3}\) femtometers, the ratio of their areas is determined to be approximately 35.2.

2. **Identifying an Unknown Nucleus**:
   - The radius of an unknown nucleus is given as 1.10 times that of tritium (which has an atomic mass number of 3). Using the formula for nuclear radius, calculations reveal that this unknown nucleus must have an atomic mass number of 4, corresponding to helium-4.

3. **Neutron Star Hypothetical**:
   - The problem asks how many neutrons could fit inside a tennis ball if they were packed with nuclear density. Calculating the volume ratio between a neutron and a tennis ball gives approximately \(1.9 \times 10^{40}\) neutrons.
   
4. **Gravitational Acceleration from a Neutron-Dense Tennis Ball**:
   - If an object is placed 2 meters away from this hypothetical tennis ball, its gravitational acceleration can be calculated using Newton's law of gravitation. The resulting acceleration is approximately \(527 \text{ m/s}^2\), or about 54 times the Earth's gravity (\(g\)).

The text provides both theoretical explanations and practical calculations for these nuclear physics scenarios.

The text discusses several problems related to nuclear physics and general physics principles:

1. **Comparison of Atomic Mass Numbers:**
   - The largest stable nucleus, bismuth with an atomic mass number of 209, and the smallest stable nucleus, hydrogen (atomic mass number of 1), are compared.
   - Assuming both nuclei are spheres, their surface area ratio is calculated using the formula for the surface area of a sphere. The result is approximately 35.2, indicating that bismuth's nucleus has a much larger area than hydrogen.

2. **Determining an Unknown Nucleus:**
   - Given the radius ratio between an unknown nucleus and tritium (hydrogen with two neutrons), the task is to identify the unknown nucleus.
   - Using the formula for nuclear radius, \( r = 1.2 \times A^{1/3} \) femtometers, where \( A \) is the atomic mass number, it's determined that the unknown nucleus has an atomic mass number of 4, making it helium-4.

3. **Neutron Density in a Tennis Ball:**
   - The problem explores packing neutrons into a tennis ball with the same density as a typical nucleus.
   - Using volume calculations and comparing the volumes of a neutron to that of the tennis ball, approximately \( 1.9 \times 10^{40} \) neutrons can fit inside.

4. **Gravitational Acceleration from Neutron-Dense Tennis Ball:**
   - The gravitational force exerted by this hypothetical neutron-packed tennis ball on an object two meters away is calculated.
   - Using Newton's law of gravitation, the resulting acceleration is found to be about 527 m/sÂ² or approximately 54 times Earth's gravity (g), demonstrating a substantial gravitational effect from such a compact mass.

These problems illustrate concepts in nuclear physics, density calculations, and gravitational effects.
