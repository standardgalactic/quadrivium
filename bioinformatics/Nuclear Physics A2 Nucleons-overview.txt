The text discusses several problems related to atomic physics and nuclear properties:

1. **Area Ratio of Bismuth and Hydrogen Nuclei**: 
   - The task involves calculating the ratio of surface areas between bismuth (with an atomic mass number of 209) and hydrogen nuclei (atomic mass number of 1). Using the formula for the area of a sphere (\(4 \pi r^2\)), where \(r = 1.2 \times A^{1/3}\) femtometers, the ratio of their areas is determined to be approximately 35.2.

2. **Identifying an Unknown Nucleus**:
   - The radius of an unknown nucleus is given as 1.10 times that of tritium (which has an atomic mass number of 3). Using the formula for nuclear radius, calculations reveal that this unknown nucleus must have an atomic mass number of 4, corresponding to helium-4.

3. **Neutron Star Hypothetical**:
   - The problem asks how many neutrons could fit inside a tennis ball if they were packed with nuclear density. Calculating the volume ratio between a neutron and a tennis ball gives approximately \(1.9 \times 10^{40}\) neutrons.
   
4. **Gravitational Acceleration from a Neutron-Dense Tennis Ball**:
   - If an object is placed 2 meters away from this hypothetical tennis ball, its gravitational acceleration can be calculated using Newton's law of gravitation. The resulting acceleration is approximately \(527 \text{ m/s}^2\), or about 54 times the Earth's gravity (\(g\)).

The text provides both theoretical explanations and practical calculations for these nuclear physics scenarios.
