In this video, we'll try and explain the concept of the surface integral.
Not the easiest concept, but remember in single variable,
if we have a single variable integral, what we are getting
is the area between a curve and the x-axis in a
2D plane. That's what a single integral was.
We generalize that to a line integral, and that gives us the area between a line
in a 3D shape, so this line runs in a 3D shape,
and the underlying x-y plane. In essence,
we went from two dimensions to three dimensions. We didn't just have
a curve and did the area under the curve, but now we had this curve running in
3 space, and we could see the area under that curve, but it still went
to the x-y plane, so still this bottom shape.
Then we looked at the double integral, and we saw that that is the
volume of a shape between a 3D curved
curved shape in space, and the x-y plane, and then the side walls
were made up by the shape, whatever the shape was
in the x-y plane, and that goes up to all this
3D shape, and we could get that volume,
but still we had a flat base at the bottom.
Now we're going to go to a surface integral,
and that calculates the volume of a 3D shape
over a curved base.
That sounds a bit difficult, so what are we trying to do?
In other words, there's this 3D surface,
so instead of this
just this shape on the 2D plane, there's now
a 3D surface in space, and we have this
three-variable function, we can say
on top of it,
and that is the surface integral.
So we're just stepping things up where the double integral was this volume of the shape
with a flat base, we're now looking at the volume of a shape
with a curved base.
So it's not this flat base, now it's this curved base,
but from a two-dimensional shape in the x-y plane
up to a three-dimensional,
so that went from two dimensions to three dimensions,
and then the volume,
now the base
is not an x-y plane,
the whole base is now a three-dimensional shape,
and
on top of that, we'll have a,
we can say, a four-dimensional shape.
So the surface integral,
we write it as such,
the surface integral over,
of F,
over S,
is then this.
So we write a capital S,
then a capital S,
because this is not a flat surface,
this is over a space,
the base is a three-dimensional space,
not a flat surface,
or a flat area,
where we used to write DA.
And just a little concept here on the side,
just as we,
we, for the double integral,
we let F,
this F and x and y equal one,
we could get the area
of this flat space,
we can let F be one here as well,
and that will give us the area
of this three-dimensional shape.
Okay,
so we've just got to build one layer of complexity,
one extra dimension onto things.
So what are we going to,
to evaluate?
So we're going to have the surface in three-space,
three-dimensional surface,
it needn't be closed,
as I'm showing it now,
any three-dimensional surface,
in three-space,
with the equation,
z equals the g of x and y,
with x and y elements,
of the xy plane,
once again.
That just says,
all that line says,
our base is now not a flat area,
it is now a shape,
a shape now forms our base.
Now we can see how the shape varies,
with respect to the base area,
in the xy plane.
So da,
ds,
and we just bring the da,
the other side,
so we're just talking,
this differential,
surface s,
that will be the square root of,
dz dx squared,
dz dy squared,
and dz dz squared,
da.
You remember where this comes from.
That means,
our surface integral,
of f of x, y, and z,
with respect to the surface itself,
is now going to be,
the f of x, y,
and the g of x and y,
so instead of the z,
we're going to put this function,
because we'll be given,
that the surface equals z,
equals 4x plus 5y squared,
we're going to plug that,
into whatever,
the function f of x, y, and z is,
and then times,
this,
square root,
da,
but remember,
dz of dz,
dz dz dz,
that's just 1.
But it can also be,
that I'm not given,
explicitly,
z equals the g of x and y,
I could be told that g,
that,
that,
y equals the g,
of y and z.
So I'll have the,
or here,
I had the x first,
so that x becomes,
that x equals g of y and z,
that means dx dx,
and dx dy,
and dx dz,
so that becomes the 1,
and here we have g of x and z,
y equals to g of x and z,
so dy dy dy just becomes 1,
so it just depends,
what surface function you're given,
if it's expressed in terms of x,
in terms of y,
or in terms of z.
So those can differ.
So we'll have to do some examples,
to make all of this clear,
but this is the recipe,
and once again,
you've got to try and understand,
that we're bumping things up by one level,
and our,
our,
our,
our,
our,
the base,
on top of which we're taking the volume,
we're still saying volume,
that was,
a two dimensional area,
circle,
square,
or rectangle,
or some irregular shape,
on top of that,
we then built this cylinder,
and it had a curved shape,
that was our volume,
that was our double integral,
but now,
it's,
we're not talking this d,
a square,
or the shape,
in the 2D plane,
the base is now a 3D shape,
and we have a 4D function,
we're taking that off,
and that is the surface integral.
