The text describes a scenario involving optics, specifically analyzing an image formed by a convex mirror. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: An object that is 0.060 meters tall is placed 0.30 meters in front of a convex mirror with a radius of curvature of 0.40 meters.

2. **Sign Conventions**:
   - The radius (R) is positive for a convex mirror.
   - The image formed by a convex mirror will be virtual, erect, and smaller than the object.

3. **Mirror Equation**: 
   - Using the mirror formula: \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{R/2} = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_i} \), where \( S_0 \) is the object distance, \( S_i \) is the image distance, and \( f \) is the focal length (negative for convex mirrors).
   - Solving this gives an image distance (\( S_i \)) of -0.12 meters, indicating a virtual image.

4. **Magnification**: 
   - The magnification formula: \( m = \frac{S_i}{S_0} = \frac{Y_i}{Y_0} \), where \( Y_i \) is the image height and \( Y_0 \) is the object height.
   - Calculating gives an image height (\( Y_i \)) of 0.024 meters (2.4 cm), confirming the image is upright.

5. **Conclusion**: The virtual, erect image formed by the convex mirror is smaller than the actual object and located behind the mirror at a distance of 0.12 meters from it. This behavior aligns with properties typical of images formed by convex mirrors.

The text discusses how to position an object relative to a concave mirror to achieve a specific image size. The goal is to form a real image that is half the size of the object using a concave mirror with a radius (and hence focal length) of 1.80 meters.

Key points:

1. **Image Characteristics**: For the desired outcome, the image must be real and inverted, with a magnification of -0.5 (since it's half the size).

2. **Mirror Equation**: The relationship is given by:
   \[
   \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_i} = -\frac{2}{R}
   \]
   where \( S_0 \) is the object distance, \( S_i \) is the image distance, and \( R \) is the radius of curvature (1.80 m).

3. **Magnification Equation**: The magnification \( m \) is:
   \[
   m = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} = -0.5
   \]
   This implies \( S_i = 0.5 S_0 \).

4. **Calculations**:
   - Substitute \( S_i = 0.5 S_0 \) into the mirror equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{2}{S_0} = -\frac{2}{1.80}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{3}{S_0} = -\frac{2}{1.80}
     \]
   - Solving for \( S_0 \):
     \[
     S_0 = -\frac{3 \times 1.80}{2} = -2.7 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: The object should be placed 2.7 meters in front of the mirror, outside its radius of curvature (1.8 m), to produce a real, inverted image that is half the size of the object.

The text describes how to position an object in front of a concave mirror with a radius of 120 cm (or focal length of -60 cm) to obtain an erect and magnified image four times the size of the object. For such an image, the object must be placed closer than the focal point of the mirror, ensuring that the image is virtual and erect.

Using the mirror equation \( \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_i} = -\frac{2}{R} \) (with R being the radius of curvature), and the magnification formula \( M = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} \), we know that for an erect image, the magnification must be positive. Given that the desired magnification is 4, it can be expressed as:

\[ M = 4 = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} \]

Rearranging gives \( S_i = -4S_0 \). Substituting into the mirror equation and solving for \( S_0 \) yields an object distance of approximately 45 cm (or 0.45 meters).

Thus, to achieve a virtual, erect image that is four times larger than the actual object, the object must be placed at about 45 cm from the concave mirror.
