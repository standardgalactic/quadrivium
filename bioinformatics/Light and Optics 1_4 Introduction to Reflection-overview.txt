The text describes a scenario involving optics, specifically analyzing an image formed by a convex mirror. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: An object that is 0.060 meters tall is placed 0.30 meters in front of a convex mirror with a radius of curvature of 0.40 meters.

2. **Sign Conventions**:
   - The radius (R) is positive for a convex mirror.
   - The image formed by a convex mirror will be virtual, erect, and smaller than the object.

3. **Mirror Equation**: 
   - Using the mirror formula: \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{R/2} = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_i} \), where \( S_0 \) is the object distance, \( S_i \) is the image distance, and \( f \) is the focal length (negative for convex mirrors).
   - Solving this gives an image distance (\( S_i \)) of -0.12 meters, indicating a virtual image.

4. **Magnification**: 
   - The magnification formula: \( m = \frac{S_i}{S_0} = \frac{Y_i}{Y_0} \), where \( Y_i \) is the image height and \( Y_0 \) is the object height.
   - Calculating gives an image height (\( Y_i \)) of 0.024 meters (2.4 cm), confirming the image is upright.

5. **Conclusion**: The virtual, erect image formed by the convex mirror is smaller than the actual object and located behind the mirror at a distance of 0.12 meters from it. This behavior aligns with properties typical of images formed by convex mirrors.

The text discusses how to position an object relative to a concave mirror to achieve a specific image size. The goal is to form a real image that is half the size of the object using a concave mirror with a radius (and hence focal length) of 1.80 meters.

Key points:

1. **Image Characteristics**: For the desired outcome, the image must be real and inverted, with a magnification of -0.5 (since it's half the size).

2. **Mirror Equation**: The relationship is given by:
   \[
   \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_i} = -\frac{2}{R}
   \]
   where \( S_0 \) is the object distance, \( S_i \) is the image distance, and \( R \) is the radius of curvature (1.80 m).

3. **Magnification Equation**: The magnification \( m \) is:
   \[
   m = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} = -0.5
   \]
   This implies \( S_i = 0.5 S_0 \).

4. **Calculations**:
   - Substitute \( S_i = 0.5 S_0 \) into the mirror equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{2}{S_0} = -\frac{2}{1.80}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{3}{S_0} = -\frac{2}{1.80}
     \]
   - Solving for \( S_0 \):
     \[
     S_0 = -\frac{3 \times 1.80}{2} = -2.7 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: The object should be placed 2.7 meters in front of the mirror, outside its radius of curvature (1.8 m), to produce a real, inverted image that is half the size of the object.

The text describes how to position an object in front of a concave mirror with a radius of 120 cm (or focal length of -60 cm) to obtain an erect and magnified image four times the size of the object. For such an image, the object must be placed closer than the focal point of the mirror, ensuring that the image is virtual and erect.

Using the mirror equation \( \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_i} = -\frac{2}{R} \) (with R being the radius of curvature), and the magnification formula \( M = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} \), we know that for an erect image, the magnification must be positive. Given that the desired magnification is 4, it can be expressed as:

\[ M = 4 = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} \]

Rearranging gives \( S_i = -4S_0 \). Substituting into the mirror equation and solving for \( S_0 \) yields an object distance of approximately 45 cm (or 0.45 meters).

Thus, to achieve a virtual, erect image that is four times larger than the actual object, the object must be placed at about 45 cm from the concave mirror.

This text explains how to analyze an optical scenario involving a convex mirror using basic principles of optics. Here is a summary:

1. **Setup**: An object that is 0.060 meters tall and positioned 0.30 meters from a convex mirror with a radius of curvature of 0.40 meters is described.

2. **Sign Convention**:
   - The image formed by the convex mirror will be virtual, upright, and reduced in size.
   - For convex mirrors, the radius (R) is positive.

3. **Equations Used**:
   - Mirror equation: \( \frac{1}{f} = -\frac{2}{R} \).
   - Image distance (\( S_i \)) calculation using: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{S_i} = -\frac{2}{R} + \frac{1}{S_0}
     \]
   - Solving gives \( S_i = -0.12 \) meters, indicating the image is virtual (since it's negative).

4. **Magnification**:
   - Magnification (\( M \)) equation: 
     \[
     M = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} = \frac{h_i}{h_0}
     \]
   - Solving for the image height (\( h_i \)), we find it to be 2.4 centimeters, upright and virtual.

5. **Ray Diagram Explanation**:
   - The text hints at drawing ray diagrams with parallel rays and lines through the center of curvature to understand why the image is virtual and upright.

In conclusion, using these principles and calculations, the scenario describes how a convex mirror forms an erect, diminished, and virtual image when an object is placed in front of it.

The text discusses the formation of images using a concave mirror with a radius of 180 centimeters (1.80 meters). The goal is to determine where to place an object so that it forms a real image that is half the size of the object itself, which will be inverted.

Key points from the text:

1. **Image Characteristics**: 
   - A virtual image formed by a concave mirror is erect and diminished.
   - For a real image, in this context, it must be inverted with magnification \( m = -\frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Mirror Equation**:
   - The relationship between the object distance (\( S_0 \)), image distance (\( S_i \)), and radius of curvature (R) is given by: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_i} = -\frac{2}{R}
     \]
   - The magnification equation relates \( S_i \) and \( S_0 \): 
     \[
     m = -\frac{S_i}{S_0}
     \]

3. **Calculation**:
   - Using the given magnification (\( m = -\frac{1}{2} \)), we derive that \( S_i = -\frac{S_0}{2} \).
   - Substituting into the mirror equation and solving for \( S_0 \), it is found to be 2.7 meters.
   - Therefore, the object should be placed 2.7 meters in front of the concave mirror.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The image formed will be real, inverted, and half the size of the object when the object is positioned at 2.7 meters from the mirror.
   - This distance (2.7 meters) is greater than the radius of curvature (1.8 meters), ensuring the formation of a real and inverted image.

The text describes a scenario involving a concave mirror with a radius of 120 cm (or 1.20 meters). The task is to determine where an object should be placed so that it forms an erect image that is four times larger than the object itself.

Key points from the explanation:

1. **Concave Mirror Properties**: For a concave mirror, an erect and enlarged image occurs when the object is positioned between the focal point (F) and the mirror's surface.

2. **Magnification (M)**: The magnification of +4 indicates that the image is four times larger than the object and is upright (positive magnification).

3. **Mirror Equation**: 
   - \( M = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} \)
   - Mirror formula: \( \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_i} = -\frac{2}{R} \)

4. **Calculations**:
   - Given the radius of curvature (R) is 1.20 meters, the focal length (f) is half of R, which is 0.60 meters.
   - Using the magnification equation \( M = +4 \), we find \( S_i = -4S_0 \).
   - Substituting into the mirror formula:
     \[
     \frac{1}{S_0} - \frac{1}{4S_0} = -\frac{2}{1.20}
     \]
   - Solving gives \( S_0 = 0.45 \) meters or 54 centimeters.

5. **Conclusion**: The object must be placed at 54 cm from the mirror to achieve an erect, four times larger image. This position is within the focal length (60 cm), resulting in a virtual and enlarged image.
