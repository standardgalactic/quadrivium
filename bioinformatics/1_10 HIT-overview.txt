This video provides an overview of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT), focusing primarily on Type 2 HIT. HIT is a serious complication from heparin therapy that can lead to both thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. The two types are distinguished as follows: 

1. **Type 1 HIT** is common, involves a slight drop in platelet count during the first few days of heparin use, which returns to normal without significant consequences.
   
2. **Type 2 HIT**, the focus here, is immune-mediated due to antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. It often manifests after about four days of unfractionated heparin and has a higher incidence with prolonged use.

**Risk Factors for Type 2 HIT:**
- Unfractioned Heparin usage
- Surgery over medical conditions
- Female gender, prior heparin exposure, age above 40

**Pathophysiology:**
Type 2 HIT involves immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and occasionally IgA) reacting to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. This leads to platelet activation, removal from circulation (causing thrombocytopenia), and release of prothrombotic microparticles, resulting in thrombosis.

**Clinical Features:**
- Thrombocytopenia typically starts 5-8 days after heparin initiation but can occur earlier with pre-existing antibodies.
- More than a 50% drop in platelet count is typical, though counts may still be above 20,000.
- Major clinical concern is thrombosis, occurring in up to 10% of patients.
- Thrombosis can present as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, venous gangrene, or arterial thrombosis with skin necrosis.

**Diagnosis:**
- Clinical diagnosis based on risk factors and symptoms.
- Specific tests include:
  - Serotonin Release Assay (high sensitivity and specificity)
  - Heparin-induced platelet aggregation
  - ELISA-based immunoassays (solid-phase)

**Prevention and Treatment:**
- Use low molecular weight heparins or alternatives like Fondaparinux, Danaparoid.
- Consider starting Warfarin early to limit heparin exposure.
- For diagnosed HIT:
  - Discontinue all forms of heparin immediately.
  - Use alternative anticoagulants (e.g., Lepirudin for liver impairment, Gatraban for renal impairment).
  - Initiate Warfarin only when the patient is adequately anticoagulated with alternatives and platelet count is above 150,000.

This summary encapsulates the critical aspects of Type 2 HIT related to its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies.

The text advises against starting Warfarin immediately as it could result in thrombotic complications. It emphasizes delaying initiation until a certain condition is met, with repeated encouragement to proceed only when it is safe.
