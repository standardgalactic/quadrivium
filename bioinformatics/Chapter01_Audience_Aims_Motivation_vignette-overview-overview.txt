In the introduction to a research course, participants learn about the resources they will receive, including video lectures, accessible documentation (both digital and printed), computer files, and raw data for practical use. The first lecture requires them to read Chapter One of the documentation, which details the course objectives, defines the target audience, and underscores its importance. Participants are encouraged to finish this reading before moving on to further lectures.
