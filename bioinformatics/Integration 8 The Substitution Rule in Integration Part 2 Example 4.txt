Here's a very interesting problem. We asked to get the indefinite integral of 1 over the cosine squared of 2y with respect to y.
What we need to know here is our trigonometric identities as well as the first derivatives of our trigonometric functions.
First of all we know that 1 over the cosine of an angle is equal to the secant of an angle.
So we can rewrite our problem as the indefinite integral of the secant of 2y squared dy.
Now let's do some substitution. Let u equals 2y, du dy is just going to be 2.
And we can rewrite dy as a half du. Let's substitute. So we're going to have the indefinite integral of the secant of u, but this is squared, half du.
We can use the constant multiple rule and bring out the half of the indefinite integral of the secant of u squared du.
What we needed to know as well, as I mentioned here, is our trigonometric differentiation rules.
The first derivative of the tangent of an angle, so d d theta of the tangent of theta, is secant square of theta.
And that's exactly what we have there. If we take the integral of both sides, the integral and the differentiation cancel out,
and we have that the integral of secant square of an angle equals the tangent of an angle.
So we have half of the tangent of u plus c, because it's an indefinite integral. Substituting gives us half the tangent u was 2y plus c.
Compальную the use.
So do we have to build them together, so we need to use the real power right now.
