This text is a detailed explanation of solving an algebraic expression involving fractions and polynomials, specifically focusing on simplifying and integrating them. The author discusses dividing one polynomial \( P \) by another polynomial \( Q \), noting that the degree of \( P \) (2) is less than the degree of \( Q \) (3). It's mentioned that \( Q \) has already been factored into components involving \( X^2 - 1 \) and \( X^2 + 1 \).

The task involves expressing a fraction as a sum of partial fractions. Since the denominator includes two distinct factors, the decomposition requires terms for each factor: one term with an \( A \) over \( X-1 \), and another term with a first-degree polynomial \( BX + C \) over \( X^2 + 1\).

The process involves:
1. Multiplying both sides by \( (X - 1) \) to simplify the fraction, which helps solve for \( A \).
2. Setting \( X = 1 \) eliminates terms involving \( B \), allowing calculation of \( A \) as \( \frac{1}{2} \).
3. With \( A \) known, further steps involve determining \( B \) and \( C \) by clearing the fraction with \( (X^2 + 1) \).

The text provides a step-by-step approach to solving for coefficients in partial fraction decomposition when dealing with quadratic factors in the denominator.

The text explains the process of simplifying and solving an algebraic expression involving polynomials. The goal is to factorize and integrate a given polynomial equation.

1. **Expression Setup**: The original expression involves terms like \(X^2 + 1\) and \(BX + C\).

2. **Cancellation**: By setting up the equation, \(X^2 + 1\) terms cancel out on both sides, leaving an expression involving \(B\) and \(C\).

3. **Coefficient Comparison**:
   - For the \(X^2\) terms: On the left side, the coefficient is 1. On the right side, it's \(\frac{1}{2} + B\). Equating these gives \(B = \frac{1}{2}\).
   - For constant terms (where \(X^0\)): The left side has no constant term (0), while the right side is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 - C\). Solving this gives \(C = \frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Substitution**: Substitute \(A = \frac{1}{2}\), \(B = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(C = \frac{1}{2}\) back into the original problem.

5. **Result**: The polynomial is factorized, allowing for integration of the simplified expression.
