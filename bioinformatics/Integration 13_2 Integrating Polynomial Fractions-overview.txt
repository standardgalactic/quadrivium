This text is a detailed explanation of solving an algebraic expression involving fractions and polynomials, specifically focusing on simplifying and integrating them. The author discusses dividing one polynomial \( P \) by another polynomial \( Q \), noting that the degree of \( P \) (2) is less than the degree of \( Q \) (3). It's mentioned that \( Q \) has already been factored into components involving \( X^2 - 1 \) and \( X^2 + 1 \).

The task involves expressing a fraction as a sum of partial fractions. Since the denominator includes two distinct factors, the decomposition requires terms for each factor: one term with an \( A \) over \( X-1 \), and another term with a first-degree polynomial \( BX + C \) over \( X^2 + 1\).

The process involves:
1. Multiplying both sides by \( (X - 1) \) to simplify the fraction, which helps solve for \( A \).
2. Setting \( X = 1 \) eliminates terms involving \( B \), allowing calculation of \( A \) as \( \frac{1}{2} \).
3. With \( A \) known, further steps involve determining \( B \) and \( C \) by clearing the fraction with \( (X^2 + 1) \).

The text provides a step-by-step approach to solving for coefficients in partial fraction decomposition when dealing with quadratic factors in the denominator.

The text explains the process of simplifying and solving an algebraic expression involving polynomials. The goal is to factorize and integrate a given polynomial equation.

1. **Expression Setup**: The original expression involves terms like \(X^2 + 1\) and \(BX + C\).

2. **Cancellation**: By setting up the equation, \(X^2 + 1\) terms cancel out on both sides, leaving an expression involving \(B\) and \(C\).

3. **Coefficient Comparison**:
   - For the \(X^2\) terms: On the left side, the coefficient is 1. On the right side, it's \(\frac{1}{2} + B\). Equating these gives \(B = \frac{1}{2}\).
   - For constant terms (where \(X^0\)): The left side has no constant term (0), while the right side is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 - C\). Solving this gives \(C = \frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Substitution**: Substitute \(A = \frac{1}{2}\), \(B = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(C = \frac{1}{2}\) back into the original problem.

5. **Result**: The polynomial is factorized, allowing for integration of the simplified expression.

The text discusses simplifying fractions and integrating them, specifically when dealing with a fraction where the degree of the numerator \( P \) is less than that of the denominator \( Q \). In this case, \( P \) has a degree of 2 and \( Q \) has a degree of 3. The denominator \( Q \) is already factored into two components: \( (X - 1) \) and \( (X^2 + 1) \).

To solve the fraction, partial fraction decomposition is used. On the right side, this results in terms like \( \frac{A}{X-1} \) and a polynomial over \( X^2 + 1 \), specifically \( \frac{BX + C}{X^2 + 1} \), due to the presence of a squared term.

The process begins by determining the constant \( A \). By multiplying both sides by \( (X - 1) \) and setting \( X = 1 \), it is found that \( A = \frac{1}{2} \).

With \( A \) known, attention shifts to finding \( B \) and \( C \). This involves eliminating other terms to focus on the polynomial term \( BX + C \). The next steps involve multiplying both sides by the denominator of this term, \( X^2 + 1 \), to isolate and solve for \( B \) and \( C \).

Overall, the text outlines a methodical approach to breaking down complex fractions into simpler components for easier integration or further manipulation.

The text describes the process of solving an algebraic equation by comparing coefficients. The original expression is \(X^2 + 1\), which needs to be matched with another form on the right side, \(BX + C\). Through manipulation, the goal is to cancel out the \(X^2\) terms and simplify the equation.

Initially, the coefficient of \(X^2\) on the left side is 1. On the right side, it's broken down into \(\frac{1}{2}X^2\) from one term and \(BX^2\) from another. Equating these coefficients gives \(1 = \frac{1}{2} + B\), leading to \(B = \frac{1}{2}\).

Next, the constant terms are considered. On the left side, there is no constant term (0). On the right side, after simplifying, it results in \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 - C\). Solving for this gives \(C = \frac{1}{2}\).

Finally, substituting these values back into the original problem (\(A = \frac{1}{2}, B = \frac{1}{2}, C = \frac{1}{2}\)), the expression is factorized and ready to be integrated.
