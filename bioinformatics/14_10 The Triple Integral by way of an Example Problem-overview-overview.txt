The text outlines a video tutorial on calculating a triple integral for the function \( f(x, y, z) = x \) over a tetrahedron defined by specific boundaries. The region is bounded by the coordinate planes (\(x=0\), \(y=0\), \(z=0\)) and the plane \(z = 2 - x - y\). 

### Key Steps:

1. **Region Description**: 
   - The tetrahedron's limits are determined from these boundaries: \( z \) ranges from 0 to \( 2-x-y \), \( y \) ranges from 0 to \( 2-x \), and \( x \) ranges from 0 to 2.

2. **Setting Up the Triple Integral**: 
   - The integral is structured as:
     \[
     \int_{x=0}^{2} \int_{y=0}^{2-x} \int_{z=0}^{2-x-y} x \, dz \, dy \, dx
     \]

3. **Integration Process**:
   - Integrate \( x \) with respect to \( z \), over the interval \([0, 2-x-y]\).
   - Integrate the resulting expression with respect to \( y \), over \([0, 2-x]\).
   - Finally, integrate the result with respect to \( x \), over \([0, 2]\).

4. **Result**:
   - The evaluated triple integral results in a value of \( \frac{2}{3} \).
