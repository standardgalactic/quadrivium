The text outlines a procedure for computing the inverse of a 3x3 matrix \(A\) using elementary row operations on an augmented matrix. Here's a concise summary of the process:

1. **Setup**: Form an augmented matrix with matrix \(A\) on the left and the identity matrix on the right.

2. **Row Operations**: Use row operations to create zeros above specific elements in \(A\), starting with the first element, by multiplying and adding rows as needed.

3. **Progressive Elimination**: Continue eliminating other specified elements (like 2, -3) to transform \(A\) into an identity matrix. Efficiently use combinations of operations such as scalar multiplication and addition to zero out entries.

4. **Identity Matrix Formation**: Once the left side is transformed into the identity matrix, the right side becomes the inverse of \(A\).

5. **Verification**:
   - Recalculate some steps to ensure correctness.
   - Multiply the derived inverse \(A^{-1}\) by another matrix \(B\) to solve for vector \(x\), confirming that \(A^{-1} \times B = x\).
   - Verify each element of the result against expected values to ensure accuracy.

6. **Conclusion**: This method demonstrates solving systems of linear equations efficiently using matrix inverses and row operations, showcasing the utility of matrix algebra.

Overall, this approach highlights how finding a matrix inverse can facilitate the solution of linear equation systems through systematic transformations.
