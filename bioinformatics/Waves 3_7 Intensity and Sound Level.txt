Let's look at this very interesting problem. We remember from the introductory lectures that we had sound level, not sound intensity, sound level, there was 10 times the lot of extent of the intensity divided by sound base intensity, which is the lowest intensity that human beings can hear, which is said at about 1 times 10 to the power negative 12 watts per square meter.
And we also said that some difference, final minus initial, the difference in decibels is if I'm going to change by 10 decibels, that equals 10 times the lot of extent of the final divided by the initial.
So, if I said to you that we've got a delta beta of 30, we're changing the decibels by 30 decibels, what is the ratio of the change of intensity?
By what factor must I multiply the initial intensity to a final intensity for a change of 30 decibels?
So, this is just very simply going to be 30 divided by 10 equals log base 10 of if divided by ii.
And remember I can rewrite this as the natural log of if divided by ii divided by the natural log of 10, which means I'm going to bring this this side.
So, it's going to be the natural log of 10 to the power 3 equals the natural log of if divided by ii.
I can get rid of those.
So, if equals 1,000 times, 1,000 times ii.
Okay, went through this rather quickly.
I think in the introductory lectures I showed a bit more carefully how we do this.
So, I've got to increase my initial intensity 1,000 times, not plus, but times, 1,000 times to get to a final intensity for an increase in decibels of 30.
But we can also ask, by what factor must we increase the pressure and the change in pressure amplitude?
How do we do that?
It's actually quite simple.
If we remember that i equals 1 half rho v omega squared is n squared.
So, if I increase this 1,000 times, if I multiply the left-hand side by 1,000, I've also got to increase this by 1,000, but that is squared.
So, that will be a half rho v omega squared, the square root of 1,000, is n squared.
Because, if I square the square root of 1,000, I get 1,000, it's n squared on this side, and I've got the extra 1,000 times 1,000 on that side.
So, that's exactly the same.
Remember, the square root of 1,000, just remember 10 square root of 10.
Okay.
We also remember that the change in pressure amplitude equals rho v omega times is n.
Okay.
That's our relationship there.
So, if I increase this by rho v omega, if I increase this by 10 square root of 10 is n, I'm also going to do that on this side.
10 square root of 10 delta P n.
So, for an increase of 30 decibels, I've got to increase the change in pressure amplitude by, I've got to increase it by a factor of, or multiplied by,
by a square root of 1,000, that's about 31.6.
I think, I've done my calculator before.
So, if 30 decibel increase in sound, I've got to increase my intensity a thousand times, and that will give me an increase in my pressure amplitude of 31.6.
Okay.
The next problem, or the next exercise, we hear a sound of 70 decibel, which then is decreased to,
50 decibel, but it remains at a frequency of 500 hertz.
We want to know what is the initial, what was at 70 decibel, what's the initial intensity, the final intensity, and then the sound wave amplitude initially, and the sound wave amplitude finally.
It's actually quite a simple problem.
If we do remember that, remember, intensity equals 10 times the log of base 10 of I divided by I into 0.
So, if we take this 10 to the other side, that's going to equal, I'm going to change this to the natural log.
You can take the antilogs of both sides, but I'm going to stick to this mathematical method, divided by the natural log of 10.
If you remember the laws of logarithms in your transcendental functions, I'm going to take this to the other side.
So, beta over 10 times the natural log of 10 is going to equal the natural log of I divided by I, 0.
I can take this to the exponents.
I'm left with 10 to the natural log of beta over 10 equals the natural log of I over I, 0.
I can get rid of these two natural logs.
So, I can say e to the power, e to the power of e to the power of the natural log of anything.
It's just that something.
So, that's 10 to the power of beta divided by 10 equals I divided by I, 0.
Or I equals 10 to the power of beta over 10 times I, 0.
So, initially, we have 70.
70 divided by 10 is 7.
So, that's 10 to the power of 7.
So, I initial is going to equal 10 to the power of 7, I, 0.
That's 10 to the power of 7 times 1.00 times 10 to the power of negative 12 watts to the square meter.
And that 12 minus 12 is going to be minus 5.
So, I initial is going to equal 10 to the power of 1.
1.
1.
1.00 times 10 to the power of negative 5 watts per square meter.
And I want to make this minus 6, so I can just get to micro watts.
So, minus 6, I've got to take it this side.
So, that's going to be 10.
That is going to be 10 micro watts per square meter.
Okay, so much for that one.
Let's quickly look at the 50.
So, I, the I of, that was I of 70 initial.
Let's make that I of 50, which is final.
So, that's just going to be a 50 there.
It's to the power of 5.
So, that's going to let me 1.00 times 10 to the power.
So, I'll have negative 12.
I'll have a positive 5.
So, that leaves me with a negative of 7 watts per square meter.
And I need to make that into a negative of 6.
So, I'm going to go to this side.
So, it's 0.1, 0.1 micro watts per square meter.
And if I just divide final by initial, this is due to that, it's going to be 0.1 divided
by 10, which is 1 over 100.
So, I final equals 1 over 100 of I initial.
It's something to remember.
So, I've decreased it a hundredfold to get, to go from 70 to 50 decibels.
Now, for SM, it's just as easy.
Remember, I equals.
And we're dealing with frequency.
So, let's use the one for frequency.
2 pi squared, frequency squared.
Rho v, SM squared.
So, I'm going to be left with SM equals the square root of I divided by 2 pi squared.
Frequency squared, rho times velocity.
So, if I do this for the initial 70, the initial 70.
So, I'm looking at I70, which is 10 there.
So, if I put in 10, I put 2's and I put pi's.
Frequency is 500 squared.
Rho is, remember, 1.21 kilograms per cubic meter.
And velocity for all these problems are less than otherwise is 343 meters per second.
Then, I'm going to get about, and I did it with my calculator before, 17 nanometers.
17 nanometers.
Okay.
We know, now we can just plug in the same value, but for I, we now get to plug in 0.1.
We can be clever.
We can also do it in another way.
And then, we see that I is directly proportional to SM squared.
I is directly proportional to the sound amplitude squared.
Sound amplitude squared.
So, from initial to final, I had to multiply by 1 over 100.
I do 1 over 100 this side.
I've got to go 1 over 10 this side.
So, it's a tenth of the initial one.
So, we're just going to be, for S50, we're just going to be SM.
M70, M50.
So, it's going to be a tenth of that, which is 720 nanometers.
Okay.
But, if you just plug in the value there and just do it, but if you realize this, you'll
see that you've changed it by a tenth.
So, if you multiply that by a tenth, you're going to get to maybe like 17 nanometers, 7 nanometers.
So, we have a point source, a point sound source, emits 30 watts of sound, 30 watts, 30.0 watts isotropically.
So, we know we're going to deal with area as an area of a sphere, 2 pi radios squared.
Because 30.0 are dealing with three significant digits, all the other things are as well.
And it says, the sound in an area of 0.750 square, um, a small microphone intercepts the sound
in an area of 0.750 square centimeters, 200 meters away from the source, our radius is 200 meters.
So, let's calculate the sound intensity there, and the power intercepted by the microphone.
So, we're looking for the sound intensity.
Remember, intensity equals the image power divided by the area.
For us, the area is going to be 4 pi r squared.
So, that's going to be very easy in as much as it's 30.0 watt divided by 4 pi 200 meters squared.
And that is going to give us, I think I did it before, yeah, about 59.7, 59.7 micro watts per square meter.
And now we also want to know, we also want to know, I think, yeah, the power, at the, the power, at the observer,
um, with this little microphone area, with this area.
So, if I just look at this, it says the power, now my observer is going to be that intensity times the area of my little observer,
which is going to be 59 point, it was 59.6, 8, 6, 8, 3, 1, thereabout, micro watts per square meter.
Now, times my square meter, which is 0.000075 square meter.
Those will go, so I'm left there, the power there of my little microphone, that observer,
and multiply that, I got about 4.48, um, nanowattes.
4.48 nanowattes.
So, just to realize that once you have the intensity, uh, at that distance, now I've got a much smaller area.
So, since that times that area, and we just need to kind of have converted this into SI, into SI units.
