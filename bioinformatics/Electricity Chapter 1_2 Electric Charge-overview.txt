In this concept-focused discussion about electric charges and static equilibrium, we consider three charged particles. Particle 1 holds a positive charge of \(8q\) and is positioned at a fixed point with particle 2 located a distance \(L\) away, carrying a negative charge of \(-2q\). The problem is to determine where to place a positively charged proton so that it achieves static equilibrium—meaning the net force on it is zero.

The analysis explores different potential positions for placing the proton:

1. **To the left of Particle 1**: A proton placed here experiences a strong repulsive force from the large positive charge of particle 1, while an attractive force from the negative charge of particle 2 is relatively weak due to greater distance. This results in a net force to the right, preventing static equilibrium.

2. **Between Particles 1 and 2**: The proton would be repelled by particle 1 and attracted towards particle 2. However, due to the larger magnitude of charge \(8q\) on particle 1 compared to \(-2q\) on particle 2, a net force always directs towards particle 1, making equilibrium impossible.

3. **To the right of Particle 2**: Here, repulsion from particle 1 and attraction to particle 2 can potentially balance out due to their respective magnitudes and distances involved. The condition for static equilibrium is derived by setting up an equation using Coulomb's law, which relates forces to charge magnitude and distance. By solving this, it is found that the proton should be placed at a position \(x = 2L\) from particle 1 (or beyond particle 2) to achieve equilibrium.

The problem concludes with another scenario involving two particles with identical charges initially separated by a known distance, focusing on the acceleration of one under electrostatic force. The analysis for this second scenario is reserved for further exploration in subsequent content.

In this segment, the focus is on understanding static equilibrium in the context of electric charges. The scenario involves three particles: Particle 1 with a charge of \(+8q\), Particle 2 with \(-2q\), and a proton (Particle 3) whose position needs to be determined for it to remain stationary.

Initially, placing the proton to the left or between Particle 1 and Particle 2 results in a net force that prevents static equilibrium. Specifically:

- To the left of Particle 1: The repulsive force from Particle 1 dominates over the attractive pull from Particle 2 due to proximity and charge magnitude differences.
- Between Particles 1 and 2: There is always a resultant force direction towards the right, making equilibrium impossible.

The solution lies in placing the proton to the right of Particle 2. Here's why:

- The repulsion from Particle 1 and attraction towards Particle 2 balance out when the proton is positioned such that the forces equalize.
- Using Coulomb’s law, the distances are set: \(x\) (distance between Particle 3 and Particle 1) and \(x - L\) (distance between Particle 3 and Particle 2).

The algebra reveals that for equilibrium, \(x = 2L\), meaning the proton should be twice the distance \(L\) from Particle 2.

Additionally, a teaser is provided for another problem involving two particles with identical charges initially separated by \(3.2 \times 10^{-3}\) meters and one particle accelerating at \(7 \text{ m/s}^2\). This problem will be explored in further detail in the next video.
