Okay, we've just seen how to multiply two complex numbers using the polar form.
Now I want to expand to you on this, what if we just had z times z,
substrict 1 times 1, and the same ones are not writing the substrict, z times z.
Well, that is going to be r times r, which is r squared.
Then we're going to have cosine of theta plus theta, which is this 2 theta,
plus i times the sine of theta plus theta, or 2 theta.
So we're going to have that, and we're going to simplify that, we can say z squared.
And you'll quickly note that the following then is true, z to the power n equals r to the power n
cosine of n theta plus i times sine of n theta.
Because that will be just r times r times r, or this is z times z times z times z,
there will be r times r times r times r, and there will be theta plus theta plus theta plus theta.
So this is the general form.
And it's also shown that unless z equals 0, this works for all integers,
not only for the positive integers as it was initially shown.
But if you have negatives 3 there, as long as z is not 0,
then you can obviously divide by 0, which is undefined.
So unless z is 0, n can be any integer.
Now there's a special case.
There's a special case.
And that is where we have r equals 1,
such that z equals the cosine of theta plus i times the sine of a single theta.
Okay, that's for r equals 1.
If we substitute this in there, then this z for that z there,
we'll note that the cosine of theta plus i times the sine of theta to the power n.
n equals, now r is 1, so that falls away.
So that is going to be the cosine of n theta plus i times the sine of n theta.
And this equation has a name.
It is the Moivris equation.
I hate calling something a formula.
Most books will call it a formula.
This is the pet peeve.
Formula is something that you use to make a chemical concoction.
That's a formula.
Anyway, the Moivris equation stating the cosine of theta
plus i times the sine of theta to the power n
equals cosine of n theta plus i times the sine of n theta.
And now we have almost enough information to carry us to what this is all about.
And that's getting the nth roots of a number.
Okay, the very last thing before we move on to roots,
and that is this concept of rotation of a vector in complex space.
If I have the number i and I put it on the complex co-ordinate plane,
so that's unit length 1, i there.
In other words, it has this angle 90 degrees.
So the modulus i, let's say the modulus of i equals 1.
It has a length of 1, there's a 1 in front of that i.
And it has a principal argument,
argument of i that is pi over 2, radians, or 90 degrees.
That is the number i on the complex system.
Now let's remind ourselves, let's have z in,
in, in, uh,
put a rotation.
So that's going to be the cosine of theta
plus i times the sine of theta.
And let's have that vector.
Let's have it right there.
There it is.
That is now going to be our x comma y,
a comma b, whichever way you want to see it.
But in polar form, in other words,
it's going to have this,
it's going to have this angle theta.
And it has a modulus,
which is the length,
which is x squared plus y squared,
square root of that sum.
Now what if I have just i?
How can I write i in polar form?
Well, i,
what does this have a modulus of 1?
Because remember,
if I write i,
it will be 0 plus 1i.
And the modulus,
the modulus of i,
this is going to be the square root of 0 squared
plus 1 squared,
which is just 1.
So it has an r value here,
a modulus of 1.
And it's going to be the cosine of
this,
pi over 2,
plus i times the sine of
pi over 2.
Now what is the sine of pi over 2?
That's 1.
1 times i is i.
That's i cosine of
pi over 2 is 0.
What if I multiply these two?
I see.
I'm going to take a complex number
and I multiply it by i.
What's going to happen geometrically?
I'm going to tell you now what's going to happen.
You are going to rotate
counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
So this will now just be rotated
by 90 degrees
and will now be there.
This is i, z.
Now this is rotated i by,
z by 90 degrees.
Let's do that.
Remember,
if it's,
remember if we had z1 times z2,
so that's going to be r1 times r2,
the modulus of i is 1,
the modulus of z remains the modulus of z.
And lo and behold,
I'm going to have the cosine of
theta plus pi over 2,
because that's my other angle.
So I've just added 90 degrees there,
plus i times the sine of
theta plus pi over 2.
So it's rotated by 90 degrees.
So multiplying a complex number by i
is the same geometrically as this,
rotating counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
Now we finally have the building blocks
to get the nth root of a number.
Most of you will be asked this in the exam.
All the things we've done up to now
was to get to this ability
to write a complex number
as to deconstruct it,
if it could say,
into nth roots.
What do we mean by nth roots?
Well, what's the square root of 4?
What I'm asking here is
4 to the power half.
So my n here equals 2.
So the 2th roots are 4,
and that equals 2.
Now, it's plus or minus 2
would be the 2 roots.
It would actually be the 2 roots
depending on how you look at things.
Let's not worry about that now.
We're talking about the nth root.
Here, n is 2.
I can ask you the 3rd roots of 8.
And remember, we can write 8 as 2 to the power 3.
So that is going to be a 3rd,
which is this 2.
Which is this 2.
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 equals 8.
Okay, that is what we mean by roots.
Now,
4
is a natural number.
We'll certainly get to some of the definitions
of natural numbers.
It comes up later.
But it's also a complex number,
and as much as it's 4 plus 0i.
Okay.
So all numbers now,
even complex numbers,
we can get the roots of,
or certainly,
what you will probably be asked
is to suddenly get the
roots of negative 8,
and we let n equals 3.
Now,
some of those roots
are going to be complex numbers.
So that's what we're going to be asked.
So we're going to define,
and this is the central part
of developing this method,
is we're going to let z equals omega n.
That's the lower case omega.
Now,
what are we saying to ourselves?
We are saying
omega is an nth root of
the complex number z.
That is what we're saying.
We're saying
that omega equals n
to the power,
z to the power,
z to the power 1 over n.
So clearly n cannot be 0.
We can't get the 0 with the roots.
So omega is an nth root of z.
That is what we're trying
to tell ourselves.
Now,
let's write omega
as a complex number itself.
We're going to use a row,
which is this italic sort of p,
rho times,
let's make it the cosine
of alpha
plus i times the sine
of alpha.
I've got some
writing problems today.
And z equals,
let's keep that to
r times the sine,
I really do.
Cosine of theta
plus i times the sine
of theta.
Let's keep it like,
let's keep it like that.
Now,
we can rewrite
omega.
Remember,
z equals omega
to the power n.
So z
is going to equal
omega to the power n.
That is
p,
that rho
to the power n
cosine of alpha.
But remember now,
we've just done this.
This is now
n times alpha.
n times alpha
plus i times
the sine of
n times alpha.
OK,
and that is going to
equal,
let's just make space
for ourselves here.
That is going to
equal
z,
which is r
times
the cosine
of theta
plus i times
the sine
of theta.
OK,
we've done all of that.
Now,
for these two
to be equal
to each other,
know two things.
The two moduli
have got to
equal each other
and n alpha
has got to
equal theta
if these two
are equal
to each other.
In other words,
rho to the power n,
which is the modulus
on this side,
has got to
equal r
on that side.
In other words,
rho
equals r
to the power
1 over n.
And that's
the real
positive root.
In other words,
I can rewrite it
like this.
I can rewrite it
like that
to make more
sense.
And since
the modulus,
since we got
the modulus
as a squared
but b squared,
and we took
the positive
square root
of that
because it's length
is always positive
no matter
where on the
complex plane
we are,
this is going
to be
the real
number r,
a real number,
not a complex number,
and we're taking
this positive
nth root
of the real number.
And as I said,
we're also
going to have
to have
n alpha
equals theta.
But remember,
we're talking
about radians
through 2 pi radians,
so we can
always add
2k times pi
because that
will be
for every
number k,
it will be
one revolution.
Now,
before I forget,
that's what I
wanted to mention.
here n,
we've introduced
n here as
the natural
numbers.
n is an element
of the natural
numbers.
Now,
there are two
ways that you
can define
natural numbers.
There's not a
universal definition
of that,
and you have
to state
what you mean
when you say
n is an element
of the natural
numbers.
Here we mean
it's the
positive integers.
Positive integers.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
etc.
Here k
is also an element
of the natural
numbers,
but we define
the natural
numbers differently
here.
We'll define
them as the
non-negative
integers,
in other words
we include
0.
Here we didn't
include 0,
here we include
0.
So that's 0
as this theta.
If k is 1,
so we add
2 pi,
that's one full
revolution,
we're back
to the same
thing.
So we can get
alpha equals
theta over
n plus
2k pi
over n
over n
and still
k is the
number of
the natural
numbers and
now we define
the natural
numbers as
the non-negative
integers.
As the non-negative
integers.
Now we can
write
now we can
write omega
as
z to the power
1 over n
z to the
power 1
over n
and that
equals
okay,
we'll put
these together.
We are now
just defining
omega and
we have
omega there.
We have
rho and
remember
rho is
now
the n
fruit of
the real
number
r
times the
cosine of
alpha
and what
is alpha
now?
Alpha is
now theta
over n
plus
2k
pi
over n
plus
i times
the sine
of
and again
alpha
is now
theta
over n
plus
2k
pi
over n
and remember
we said
that this
is the
nth root
of
z
and now
we have
an equation
to work
out the
nth root
of any
number
believe it
or not.
Okay
so it's
not too
difficult
to derive
and I'll
show you
shortly
how to
use this
equation
of
nth root
of
any
number
use this
equation
to get
its
different
roots.
