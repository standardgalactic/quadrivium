Pascal's Principle states that pressure applied to an incompressible fluid within a closed system is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. In the context of a hydraulic lift, when a force is applied over a small area (input), it generates pressure that is distributed uniformly across the entire fluid. This results in an output force on a larger area, allowing for the lifting of heavier objects with relatively less input force.

Key points include:

1. **Pressure Transmission**: The principle relies on consistent fluid density and ensures that any applied pressure is equally shared throughout the system (P = Force/Area).

2. **Force Amplification**: A small input force over a small area results in a proportionally larger output force when acting over a larger area, enabling significant lifting power.

3. **Volume Conservation**: The volume displaced by pushing into one side of the fluid must equal the volume on the other side (Area × Distance).

4. **Work Equivalence**: The work input equals the work output (Force × Distance), meaning while the output force is greater, the distance moved on the larger area side will be smaller.

These principles allow engineers to design systems where small forces can lift large weights efficiently by leveraging pressure and fluid mechanics in hydraulic systems.
