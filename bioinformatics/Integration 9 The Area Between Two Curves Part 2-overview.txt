The text discusses integrating with respect to \(y\), focusing on finding the area between two curves. This involves using horizontal approximating rectangles, where the functions are expressed in terms of \(y\) instead of \(x\). In this context, \(f(y)\) represents the right-hand function and \(g(y)\) the left-hand function. The limits of integration for \(y\) range from a lower value \(c\) to an upper value \(d\). Understanding these basic concepts makes the process straightforward.
