The text discusses integrating with respect to \(y\), focusing on finding the area between two curves. This involves using horizontal approximating rectangles, where the functions are expressed in terms of \(y\) instead of \(x\). In this context, \(f(y)\) represents the right-hand function and \(g(y)\) the left-hand function. The limits of integration for \(y\) range from a lower value \(c\) to an upper value \(d\). Understanding these basic concepts makes the process straightforward.

The text discusses integrating with respect to \(y\) as finding the area between two curves. It emphasizes that this process, while conceptually different from traditional integration concerning \(x\), remains manageable by adhering to some fundamental ideas.

Key points include:

1. When dealing with horizontal approximating rectangles (as opposed to vertical ones used in standard \(x\)-integration), the integral formula includes a \(y\) term instead of an \(x\).

2. In this context, the function \(f(y)\) represents the right-hand curve and \(g(y)\) represents the left-hand curve.

3. The limits of integration are along the y-axis, with \(c\) as the lower limit and \(d\) as the upper limit.

Understanding these basic concepts allows for straightforward calculation of the area between two curves when integrating with respect to \(y\).
