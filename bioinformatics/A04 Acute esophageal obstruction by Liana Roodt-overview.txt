The text discusses the management of acute and acute on chronic esophageal obstruction. It defines this condition as a sudden blockage in the esophagus, impeding the movement of fluids and solids from the mouth to the stomach, sometimes accompanied by pain. Common complications include aspiration, perforation, and bleeding.

The focus is not on these complications but rather on management strategies, with specific attention given to foreign body ingestion in children as a cause of acute obstruction. The approach includes classification based on whether obstructions are inside or outside the esophageal lumen—foreign bodies, food boluses, neoplasms (benign or malignant), and external compression.

In children, common causes include coins, toys, and especially batteries, which pose unique risks due to caustic effects and potential tissue damage. Batteries larger than 15 mm are particularly concerning as they can lead to severe complications like tracheoesophageal fistula or esophageal burns.

Diagnostic methods involve x-rays and contrast studies to locate foreign bodies and assess complications. For batteries, emergency endoscopy is recommended due to the high risk of injury.

The decision for removal involves considering factors such as age, clinical condition, and type of ingested object. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for coin ingestion in stable children aged 4-6 years or older, as a significant percentage pass spontaneously within 16 hours. However, sharp objects or batteries generally necessitate immediate intervention.

The text discusses strategies for managing foreign body obstructions in the esophagus, focusing on endoscopic removal as the preferred method. When dealing with such cases, especially if an underlying condition like achalasia is present, specific management strategies should be considered.

### Management of Esophageal Foreign Bodies:
1. **Endoscopic Removal**: 
   - The primary approach for removing foreign bodies from the esophagus.
   - Summarized as safe and effective for most patients, with rare complications such as perforation or bleeding in very young children.
   
2. **Alternative Methods** (for specific cases):
   - **Mucosal Breach**: Small objects can be removed by creating a mucosal breach under direct vision using tools like Dormia baskets.
   - **Esophageal Dilatation**: Employed in special scenarios, such as with sharp objects or large coin impactions.

### Management of Underlying Achalasia:
Achalasia is characterized by incomplete relaxation and increased tone of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), along with a lack of peristalsis. For patients presenting with an acute obstruction due to achalasia, management focuses on both immediate removal of the obstructive bolus endoscopically and addressing the underlying condition.

1. **Medical Management**:
   - Utilizes calcium channel blockers and nitrates to reduce LES tone.
   - Has a low success rate (~10%) but can be considered in patients who cannot undergo other interventions.

2. **Endoscopic Treatment Options**:
   - **Botulinum Toxin Injections**: Aimed at reducing acetylcholine release to decrease LES tone. Limited value due to high recurrence and potential for complicating future surgeries.
   - **Pneumatic Dilatation**: Recommended when surgery is not suitable, involves inflating a balloon at the gastroesophageal junction. It has a moderate success rate (70-80%) but carries risks like perforations (~5%) and increased reflux.
   - **Endoscopic Myotomy**: A newer technique with promising outcomes, though it requires significant expertise due to its complexity.

3. **Surgical Management**:
   - **Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy with Partial Fundoplication**: Considered the procedure of choice for treating achalasia. It effectively reduces LES pressure and improves long-term success rates.

In conclusion, while endoscopic removal is the preferred method for addressing esophageal foreign bodies, careful consideration must be given to managing underlying conditions like achalasia through a combination of medical, endoscopic, and surgical approaches depending on patient-specific factors.

The text discusses treatment options for esophageal conditions, focusing on procedures that involve partial wraps using trocars to manage symptoms like reflux effectively. This method has shown excellent long-term results for treating achalasia.

It briefly mentions stenting as a viable option, particularly for patients with new or chronic esophageal obstructions due to tumors. Stents can also be used for other conditions such as refractory dysphagia and perforations. The text compares self-expanding metal stents (both covered and uncovered) and plastic stents in the US market. Covered metal stents are superior to uncovered ones, primarily because they prevent migration better by embedding into tissues. However, fully covered nitinol prostheses pose a higher risk of migration.

While self-expanding plastic stents effectively palliate malignant dysphagia with fewer complications like occlusion and migration, metal stents still have an edge in reducing overall complications for malignant diseases. The recommendation strength for using metal stents is strong, despite potential issues such as aspiration, malposition, or chest pain.

Ultimately, the decision on which procedure to use depends on patient-specific factors, including age, underlying conditions, and the nature of the obstruction. The preferred approach is endoscopic removal of obstructions when possible, followed by addressing any underlying causes.

The text provides an overview of managing acute and chronic esophageal obstruction, focusing on specific causes and their management. Here’s a summary:

1. **Definition**: Acute or acute on chronic esophageal obstruction refers to sudden complete or near-complete blockage in the esophagus, hindering movement of fluids and solids from the mouth to the stomach. Complications include aspiration, perforation, and bleeding.

2. **Focus**: The discussion centers on management strategies for different causes of esophageal obstruction, such as foreign body ingestion in children and achalasia in adults, while excluding complications like perforation and bleeding covered by others.

3. **Classification**:
   - **Internal Obstruction**: Caused by foreign bodies (e.g., coins, toys), food boluses, or neoplasms.
   - **External Compression**: Resulting from external pressure on the esophagus.

4. **Foreign Body Ingestion in Children**:
   - Common objects include coins and batteries. Battery ingestion is emphasized due to its potential for causing caustic damage, tissue necrosis, and mercury poisoning.
   - Batteries larger than 20 mm pose a high risk of esophageal injury. Emergency endoscopy is recommended for all battery ingestions.
   - Diagnostic tools: X-rays (lateral and anterior-posterior views) and contrast studies help locate the foreign body and identify complications like tracheoesophageal fistulas or strictures.

5. **Diagnostic and Management Strategies**:
   - Radiologic evaluations are crucial but clinical situations often dictate immediate endoscopy.
   - Coins typically pass spontaneously within 8-16 hours, allowing for a watch-and-wait approach depending on age and condition.
   - Immediate removal is necessary for sharp objects or batteries due to higher risks.

Overall, the management of esophageal obstruction requires careful diagnosis and tailored intervention based on the cause and patient specifics.

The text discusses various methods for managing esophageal obstructions, particularly focusing on foreign bodies stuck in the esophagus and conditions like achalasia. Here's a summary:

1. **Esophageal Foreign Bodies:**
   - Preferred method for removing obstructive boluses is endoscopic intervention.
   - Achalasia patients presenting with acute obstruction are managed endoscopically first, followed by addressing the underlying achalasia.

2. **Achalasia Management:**
   - **Medical Management:** Uses calcium channel blockers and nitrates to reduce lower esophageal sphincter resistance, but only effective in about 10% of cases.
   - **Endoscopic Treatment Options:**
     - *Botulinum Toxin Injection:* Temporarily reduces muscle tension by blocking acetylcholine release. About 30% of patients experience relief one year post-treatment. It may complicate future surgical interventions due to inflammation.
     - *Pneumatic Dilatation:* Involves inflating a balloon at the gastroesophageal junction to rupture muscle fibers, with a success rate of 70-80%. However, it carries a 5% perforation risk and often requires multiple sessions. It also increases the incidence of reflux disease post-procedure.
     - *Oral Endoscopic Myotomy:* A newer technique showing promise but is technically demanding with a steep learning curve. Success depends on significantly reducing lower esophageal sphincter pressure below 10 mmHg.

3. **Surgical Management:**
   - Laparoscopic Heller myotomy, often combined with partial fundoplication, is the procedure of choice for treating achalasia due to its effectiveness in providing long-term relief.

Overall, the management of esophageal obstructions and conditions like achalasia involves a combination of endoscopic and surgical techniques tailored to the patient's specific condition and overall health.

The text discusses various treatment options for esophageal conditions, focusing on surgical techniques and stenting. A particular procedure involving a partial wrap using five trocars has shown excellent results in relieving symptoms and preventing reflux with fast recovery times and short hospital stays. This method is considered superior for long-term outcomes in treating accoladesia.

Stenting is highlighted as an effective option for esophageal obstruction due to tumors or other causes, including its use for refractory cases, fistulas, perforations, and leaks. Stents are available from numerous manufacturers globally and come in various materials like metal (nickel, titanium) and plastic, each with different characteristics such as flexibility, diameter, and removability.

Partially covered self-expanding metal stents have been shown to be superior due to reduced risks of migration compared to uncovered ones. Recently approved fully covered nitinol stents offer removability but may increase the risk of migration; further data is awaited for these stents. Metal stents generally result in fewer complications than plastic ones, which are effective yet show higher rates of occlusion and migration.

The recommendation emphasizes moderate-quality evidence for using metal stents due to their lower complication rates compared to plastic ones. However, stenting can still lead to various complications such as aspiration, malpositioning, and perforation. When considering treatment options, it's crucial to evaluate the patient’s overall condition, including age, underlying diseases, and specific needs.

In summary, for esophageal obstructions or related conditions, both surgical procedures involving partial wraps and stenting offer effective solutions, with metal stents generally preferred due to their lower complication rates. Each case should be individually assessed to determine the best treatment approach.
