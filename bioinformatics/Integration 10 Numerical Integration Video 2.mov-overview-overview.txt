The video explains Simpson's sums, a numerical integration technique that improves upon Riemann and trapezoidal sums. Instead of using rectangles to approximate areas under curves, Simpsonâ€™s method uses parabolas for each pair of segments or bases. These parabolic segments are symmetric around their midpoint and are determined by fitting them through three points: \((-h, y_0)\), \( (0, y_1) \), and \((h, y_2)\).

The area under one such parabolic segment is calculated with the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\Delta x}{3} (y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2)
\]

where \(\Delta x\) represents the width of each base, given by \((b-a)/n\) and \(n\) must be even. For a complete integration from \(a\) to \(b\), the Simpson's sum formula is:

\[
\frac{\Delta x}{3} (y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + \ldots + 2y_{n-2} + 4y_{n-1} + y_n)
\]

The coefficients in the formula alternate between 1, 4, and 2. This method offers a more accurate approximation by better capturing the function's curvature compared to simpler numerical integration techniques.
