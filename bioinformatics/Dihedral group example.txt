So, we're still after the center of a group.
We've looked at the dihedral group, so I just want to show you the dihedral group in six elements,
as we promised, because we're going to find the center of this massive group.
So, if I stand aside, there you can see my six-sided polygon,
and I've named it 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the six points here on the side, the corners.
And let's do a bit of swapping this around, so that when I do something to it,
and you look away and you look back, apart from these numbers, when these numbers are gone,
this figure stays exactly like it is now.
So, number 1 is, very simply, we do nothing.
1 stays at 1, 2, 2, and 2, 3 stays at 3, no problem there.
Let's rotate it by 60 degrees.
If I rotate it by 60 degrees, you're not going to know the difference if these are not there,
but 1 is going to go to 2, 2 is going to go to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 1.
So, that is going to be that permutation.
And 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, 3 goes to 4, 4 goes to 5, 5 goes to 6, 6 goes back to 1.
So, that's one rotation through 60 degrees, but let's rotate it twice,
and we'll call that sigma squared.
So, 1 is going to go to 3, 2 is going to go to 4, 3 is going to go to 5, 4 is going to go to 6,
and 6 is going to go to 2.
So, let's see what happens there.
1 goes to 3, 1 goes to 3, so 1 goes to 1, 2, 3 goes to 1, 2, 3 goes to 5,
and 5 goes back to 1, so we have to close that.
And then 2, 2 is going to go to 4, which is going to go to 6, which is going to go back to 2.
so we see that cycle now we can do it three times so that's 180 degrees pi radians that
we're going to go one goes to one two three one goes to four two goes to five three goes to six
and we rotate it through 180 degrees and we see there now we can rotate one all the way to five
and we can rotate one all the way to six and we see it there and if we do all the way to six one
goes to six six to five five four four three three two two two back to one so that's one thing that
we can do but what about just flipping these so let's flip them let's flip it along this axis here
so one is going to stay with one one is going to stay with one and four is going to four go to four
but two and six will swap and three and five will swap so we get two and six will swap and three
and five will swap so that's along this axis if we fix these two points and flip it along this
two and five are going to stay two and five are going to stay but you can see what's going to
happen to three and six and one and four and then finally we can do along this axis and two is going
to go to four and one is going to go to five five goes to one and four goes to two but there are
three more lines that we can draw through this and we can rotate if we take this axis here and we go
90 degrees up against it right there if we flip that we see one and two three and six and four and five
are going to go 90 degrees along this one which means here I flip it here one and four two and three
and five and six are going to go and 90 degrees along this one in other words down there we get three and
four two and five and one and six that are going to go so we see as we expected we see these 12 elements
that we can make up 2n n being six we see these 12 specific permutations that we can do in this
dihedral group and this is a dihedral group with even even number of elements in the set even number of
elements in the set and when we have a dihedral group with even numbers the following is going
to happen we're going to see the center just remember this for now because we haven't discussed
what a center is the center is going to be in the center we can have the trivial
rotation there nothing happens in the 180 degree or pi radians rotations so the one where one goes to four
and four goes to one one goes to four four goes one two goes to five and and five goes to two three
goes to six and six goes to three that's going to be these two are going to be very special
so if we have a dihedral group and even elements the identity element and the 180 degree rotations are
going to form what we call the center of a group and I'm going to go quickly to Mathematica and I'm just
going to show you a screenshot of that so we can have a look at these two very specific what happens
to these two very specific if we look at the if we look at the group so that is the dihedral group
and six elements that is this dihedral group and six elements it's set in this binary operation of of
um just combining any any two of these that with a binary operation there and we're going to see
something very special of course that one it's always it's the trivial one it always there's
always something special about it but there's very something very special about this 180 degree
rotation as well let's go have a look so there we go we see Cayley's table as we did before
for the six elements the six the dihedral group and six elements which gives us these 12 permutations
and Mathematica here has just numbered them 1 to 12 but 1 would be the identity element and I want
you to have a look at element number 8 here which is actually the rotation through pi radians so 1
goes to 4 and 4 goes to 1 2 goes to 5 and 5 goes to 2 and 3 goes to 6 and 6 goes to 3 have a look at
this the identity element will always commute because composing with anything or anything with
it in the set that that is always going to commute but have a look at this rotation here which
Mathematica is called 8 here the just take my word for that this is the rotation through 180 degrees
if I compose 8 with 1 I get 8 and if I compose 1 with 8 I get 8 obviously but have a look at this if
I compose 8 then with the next element which is 2 here I get 7 and if I take 2
composed with 8 I get 7 as well and 8 with 3 is 9 and 3 with 8 is also 9
10 10 12 12 11 11 2 2 1 1 3 3 4 4 6 6 5 5
there's commutivity here there's something very special about this element the identity element
and the rotation through 180 degrees that element that permutation they commute with all others and
these two elements they form a subgroup we're going to show that prove that that is a subgroup
of G and that is actually then those two elements is what is called the center of G
