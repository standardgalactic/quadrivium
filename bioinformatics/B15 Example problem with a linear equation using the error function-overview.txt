The text describes solving an initial value problem for a differential equation involving a variable \( y \) and its derivative. The equation is given as:

\[ y' - 2xy = 2, \]

with the initial condition that when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \).

To solve this first-order linear differential equation, an integrating factor is used. The integrating factor is calculated from the coefficient of \( y \) in the equation, which is \(-2x\). This results in an integrating factor:

\[ e^{\int -2x \, dx} = e^{-x^2}. \]

Multiplying through by this integrating factor transforms the differential equation into a form where the left side becomes the derivative of \( (e^{-x^2} y) \):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}(e^{-x^2} y) = 2e^{-x^2}. \]

Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), we find:

\[ e^{-x^2} y = \int 2e^{-x^2} \, dx + C. \]

The integral of \( e^{-x^2} \) is a non-elementary function, often expressed in terms of the error function, denoted as \( \text{erf}(x) \). Thus, the solution becomes:

\[ y = 2e^{x^2} \int e^{-t^2} \, dt + Ce^{x^2}, \]

where we use a substitution for integration limits from 0 to \( x \).

Using the initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \), we solve for \( C \):

\[ 1 = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 + C \cdot 1, \]

yielding \( C = 1 \).

The final solution is expressed using the error function:

\[ y = e^{x^2} \left( 2 \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt + 1 \right). \]

This can be rewritten using the properties of the error function as:

\[ y = \sqrt{\pi} \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + e^{x^2}. \]

Thus, the solution incorporates both an exponential term and a term involving the error function.

The text describes solving an initial value problem involving a differential equation. The equation given is:

\[ y' - 2xy = 2 \]

with the initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \).

To solve this, we first identify that it's a linear differential equation and find its integrating factor, which is \( e^{-x^2} \). By multiplying through by this integrating factor, we rewrite the equation in a form where the left side becomes the derivative of \( (e^{-x^2}y) \):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}(e^{-x^2}y) = 2e^{-x^2} \]

Integrating both sides gives:

\[ e^{-x^2}y = 2\int e^{-x^2} \, dx + C \]

This integral involves a non-elementary function. Multiplying through by \( e^{x^2} \) to solve for \( y \), we get:

\[ y = 2e^{x^2}\int e^{-x^2} \, dx + Ce^{x^2} \]

Using the initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \), we find \( C = 1 \).

The integral \( \int e^{-x^2} \, dx \) is related to the error function, denoted as \( \text{erf}(x) \). Specifically:

\[ \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \text{erf}(x) \]

Thus, the solution can be expressed in terms of the error function:

\[ y = 2e^{x^2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \text{erf}(x)\right) + e^{x^2} \]

Simplifying, we have:

\[ y = \sqrt{\pi} \, \text{erf}(x) + e^{x^2} \]

This is the solution to the initial value problem.
