The text describes solving an initial value problem for a differential equation involving a variable \( y \) and its derivative. The equation is given as:

\[ y' - 2xy = 2, \]

with the initial condition that when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \).

To solve this first-order linear differential equation, an integrating factor is used. The integrating factor is calculated from the coefficient of \( y \) in the equation, which is \(-2x\). This results in an integrating factor:

\[ e^{\int -2x \, dx} = e^{-x^2}. \]

Multiplying through by this integrating factor transforms the differential equation into a form where the left side becomes the derivative of \( (e^{-x^2} y) \):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}(e^{-x^2} y) = 2e^{-x^2}. \]

Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), we find:

\[ e^{-x^2} y = \int 2e^{-x^2} \, dx + C. \]

The integral of \( e^{-x^2} \) is a non-elementary function, often expressed in terms of the error function, denoted as \( \text{erf}(x) \). Thus, the solution becomes:

\[ y = 2e^{x^2} \int e^{-t^2} \, dt + Ce^{x^2}, \]

where we use a substitution for integration limits from 0 to \( x \).

Using the initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \), we solve for \( C \):

\[ 1 = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 + C \cdot 1, \]

yielding \( C = 1 \).

The final solution is expressed using the error function:

\[ y = e^{x^2} \left( 2 \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt + 1 \right). \]

This can be rewritten using the properties of the error function as:

\[ y = \sqrt{\pi} \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + e^{x^2}. \]

Thus, the solution incorporates both an exponential term and a term involving the error function.
