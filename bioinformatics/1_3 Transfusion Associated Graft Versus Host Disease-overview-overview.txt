Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a severe condition that arises when donor lymphocytes attack the recipient's cells after transfusions or hematopoietic cell transplants. It primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with lymphomas, leukemias, or undergoing chemotherapy, and occurs more frequently in recipients receiving closely matched HLA from relatives.

**Pathogenesis:** TA-GVHD can occur when there is specific HLA matching, particularly if the donor is homozygous for an HL-A haplotype unrecognized by a heterozygous recipient. Close family members are at higher risk due to similar HLA types.

**Incidence and Clinical Presentation:**
- Following transfusions, TA-GVHD is often fatal.
- It occurs in 20-25% of hematopoietic cell transplants but is less likely to be fatal.
- Symptoms appear 4-30 days post-transfusion, including fever, rash, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, coughing, and may progress to toxic epidermal necrolysis.
- Laboratory findings typically show pancytopenia, electrolyte imbalances from diarrhea, abnormal liver function tests, and a "plastic" bone marrow.

**Treatment:** Current treatments, including steroids, azathioprine, antithymocyte globulin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, UV irradiation, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and thalidomide, have limited success. Thus, prevention is prioritized over treatment.

**Prevention:** Preventive measures focus on:
- Irradiating lymphocyte-containing blood components with caesium gamma radiation to reduce storage time.
- Leukodepletion using specific filters, though not universally effective in preventing TA-GVHD.

Overall, the emphasis remains on preventing TA-GVHD through irradiation and other preventive strategies due to its often fatal nature.
