The text outlines a dataset analysis focusing on differences between groups based on age, HbA1c, and CRP levels using both non-parametric and parametric statistical tests. Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Data Analysis Overview**:
   - The goal is to compare groups by age, HbA1c, and CRP.
   - Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for each variable.

2. **Statistical Tests Conducted**:
   - **Age**: Non-normally distributed; Mann-Whitney U test used.
   - **HbA1c**: Normally distributed; both t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were applicable, showing significant differences.
   - **CRP**: Non-normally distributed; Mann-Whitney U test applied.

3. **Key Findings**:
   - No significant age difference (p-value = 0.28).
   - Significant HbA1c level differences (p < 0.01) with equal variance allowing for an equal variance t-test.
   - CRP levels showed no specific findings mentioned here, but the non-parametric approach was used.

4. **Interpretation**:
   - Age differences are not significant; however, HbA1c levels differ meaningfully between groups.

5. **Reporting**:
   - Use medians for age and CRP reporting due to their distributions.
   - Report means for HbA1c with both t-test and Mann-Whitney U results if applicable.

The analysis also included comparing minor vs. major CRP levels and differences between male and female groups using non-parametric tests for HbA1c and CRP. The work was conducted in Julia, with visualizations created in GADFLY, demonstrating the software's capability for complex statistical analyses suitable for academic use. The project outcomes were satisfactory, indicating potential for future collaboration.
