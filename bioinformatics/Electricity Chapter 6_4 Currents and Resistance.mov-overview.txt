The text explores the scenario of lightning striking the earth and its effect on a person standing nearby. When lightning strikes, it creates an electric current that spreads out in a half-sphere pattern from the point of impact. If a person stands with their feet apart by a distance \( \Delta r = d \), they can be considered as part of an electrical circuit due to the resistance of their body.

The key concept is calculating the potential difference (\(\Delta V\)) across the person's feet, which involves integrating the electric field over the distance between their feet. The electric field (\(E\)) is expressed in terms of resistivity (\(\rho\)), current (\(I\)), and the radius (\(r\)) from the strike point: 

\[ E = \frac{\rho I}{2 \pi r^2} \]

The potential difference is then determined by integrating this expression over the distance between the feet:

\[ \Delta V = -\int_{d}^{d + \Delta r} \frac{\rho I}{2 \pi r^2} \, dr \]

This calculation shows that the closer a person's feet are together (\(\Delta r\) is small), the smaller the current through their body.

The text also discusses Ohm's Law, emphasizing that it defines a linear relationship between current and potential difference for materials that follow this law. It clarifies that Ohm's Law does not define \(I = V/R\) but rather states that if there is a constant gradient of current versus potential difference, the material obeys Ohm's Law.

Finally, the text covers power in an electric circuit, showing how energy (\(U\)) relates to charge (\(q\)), current (\(i\)), and voltage (\(v\)). The power dissipated as thermal energy in a resistor is given by:

\[ P = iv \]

For resistors, this can be expressed in two forms based on Ohm's Law:

1. \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \)
2. \( P = I^2 R \)

These equations apply specifically to resistive components where energy is converted into heat.

The text discusses the distribution of electrical current when lightning strikes the Earth, focusing on how it affects a person standing nearby. The current spreads in a hemispherical pattern due to the strike's nature. If a person stands with their feet apart by a distance \( \delta r = d \), they form an electric circuit through which current can pass, creating a potential difference between their feet.

The potential difference (\( \Delta V \)) is calculated using the integral of the electric field over the path from one foot to the other. The text explains that the electric field (\( E \)) at any point depends on resistivity (\(\rho\)), current (\(I\)), and distance (\(r\)), following the equation \( E = \frac{\rho I}{2 \pi r^2} \). This formula considers only a half-sphere, as the ground doesn't affect the entire sphere.

It's noted that standing closer together reduces the potential difference across the feet, thereby reducing the current through the body. The text briefly reviews Ohm's law, emphasizing it describes a linear relationship between current and voltage for materials that obey it. Materials not adhering strictly to this linear relationship don't follow classical Ohm's law.

Regarding power in an electrical circuit, the text explains how potential energy (\( U \)) changes with charge (\( q \)) and voltage (\( V \)). The rate of change of this energy over time gives the power (\( P = IV \)), applicable to any circuit element like a resistor or battery. For resistors specifically, if \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), power can also be expressed as \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \) or \( P = I^2 R \). These equations apply only to elements that adhere to Ohm's law and convert electrical energy into thermal energy.
