The text describes the process of solving a three-dimensional flux problem involving vector calculus. Here’s a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: The problem involves calculating flux through a surface where fluid velocity is given by a vector \( \mathbf{F} = (0, z, z) \). The surface is defined by the equation \( z = 6 - 3x - 2y \), with constraints \( x > 0 \), \( y > 0 \), and \( z > 0 \).

2. **Surface Integral**: To find the flux through this surface, a surface integral of the form \(\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS\) is set up, where \(\mathbf{n}\) is the normal vector to the surface and \(dS\) represents an infinitesimal area element on the surface.

3. **Normal Vector Calculation**: The normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) is derived from the gradient of the function defining the surface (\(g(x, y, z) = z - (6 - 3x - 2y)\)), giving \(\nabla g = (3, 2, 1)\). This is then normalized by dividing by its magnitude \(\sqrt{14}\).

4. **Dot Product**: The dot product of the vector field \(\mathbf{F} = (0, z, z)\) and the normal vector \(\mathbf{n} = \frac{(3, 2, 1)}{\sqrt{14}}\) is computed to be \(\frac{3z}{\sqrt{14}}\).

5. **Surface Element**: The differential surface element \(dS\) is determined using \(dS = \sqrt{14} \, dA\), where \(dA\) is the area element in the \(xy\)-plane.

6. **Integral Simplification**: Substituting these into the integral, terms simplify, leaving a double integral over the region projected onto the \(xy\)-plane: \(\iint_R 3z \, dA\). The limits for this integration are derived by setting \(z = 0\) to find boundaries in the \(xy\)-plane.

7. **Integration**: The resulting double integral is solved step-by-step:
   - Integrate with respect to \(y\) from 0 to \(-\frac{3}{2}x + 3\).
   - Then integrate with respect to \(x\) from 0 to 2.
   - Simplify the result of these integrations.

8. **Final Result**: After performing the integration, any algebraic errors are checked, and the final value of the flux is obtained.

This process involves understanding vector calculus concepts such as gradients, normal vectors, dot products, and surface integrals to solve the flux problem through a specified surface in three-dimensional space.

The text appears to describe a process of evaluating an integral or solving a mathematical problem involving integration. Here’s a summary:

1. The speaker begins with the expression "9 over 4x squared dx," which they simplify to 3.

2. They discuss a term "-9x" and consider whether it should be negative, eventually determining that part of their result is "-9 over 2x² + 9x - 9 over 12x³."

3. The integration limits are from 0 to 2. After plugging in these values, they calculate the definite integral.

4. They perform several arithmetic operations: 
   - Calculating "negative 9 times 8 divided by 12" and simplifying.
   - Ensuring a factor of 3 is carried through their calculations.

5. The final result is confirmed to be 18 after verifying the steps, with no mistakes detected in the process. 

The speaker expresses satisfaction with arriving at the correct answer.
