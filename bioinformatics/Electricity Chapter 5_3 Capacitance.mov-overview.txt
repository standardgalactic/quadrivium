The text discusses calculating the capacitance of an isolated sphere and handling capacitors in parallel and series.

1. **Capacitance of an Isolated Sphere:**
   - The capacitance \( C \) of an isolated sphere can be derived using algebraic manipulation, leading to the formula:
     \[
     C = 4\pi\varepsilon_0 R
     \]
   where \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space and \( R \) is the radius of the sphere.

2. **Capacitors in Parallel:**
   - For capacitors connected in parallel, their total capacitance \( C_{\text{total}} \) is the sum of individual capacitances:
     \[
     C_{\text{parallel}} = C_1 + C_2
     \]
   - The potential difference across each capacitor remains the same.

3. **Capacitors in Series:**
   - For capacitors connected in series, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual capacitances:
     \[
     \frac{1}{C_{\text{series}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
     \]
   - The charge on each capacitor remains constant.

4. **Example Problem:**
   - Given a circuit with capacitors \( C_1 = 12 \, \mu F \), \( C_2 = 5.3 \, \mu F \) in parallel, and \( C_3 = 4.5 \, \mu F \) in series:
     - First, find the equivalent capacitance of the parallel combination:
       \[
       C_{12} = C_1 + C_2 = 17.3 \, \mu F
       \]
     - Then, calculate the total capacitance with \( C_3 \) in series:
       \[
       \frac{1}{C_{123}} = \frac{1}{C_{12}} + \frac{1}{C_3} = \frac{1}{17.3 \times 10^{-6}} + \frac{1}{4.5 \times 10^{-6}}
       \]
     - Solving gives \( C_{123} = 3.57 \, \mu F \).

This summary covers the key points and calculations presented in the text regarding capacitors and their configurations.

The text explains how to determine the capacitance of an isolated sphere and how capacitors behave when placed in parallel or series.

1. **Capacitance of an Isolated Sphere**: 
   - The derivation begins by considering two concentric spherical conductors with radii A (inner) and B (outer).
   - As B approaches infinity, the formula for capacitance simplifies to \( C = 4\pi \varepsilon_0 R \), where \( R \) is the radius of the sphere. This shows that the capacitance of an isolated sphere depends only on its radius and the permittivity of free space.

2. **Capacitors in Parallel**:
   - When capacitors are connected in parallel, their equivalent capacitance (\( C_{\text{eq}} \)) is simply the sum of their individual capacitances: \( C_{\text{eq}} = C_1 + C_2 \).
   - The potential difference across each capacitor remains the same.

3. **Capacitors in Series**:
   - For capacitors connected in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of their individual capacitances: \( \frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} \).
   - The charge on each capacitor remains constant, while the voltage across them differs.

4. **Example Problem**:
   - In a given circuit with capacitors in both parallel and series configurations, calculate the equivalent capacitance.
   - For instance, if two capacitors (\( C_1 = 12 \) µF and \( C_2 = 5.3 \) µF) are in parallel, their combined capacitance is \( 17.3 \) µF.
   - If this combination is in series with another capacitor (\( C_3 = 4.5 \) µF), the equivalent capacitance can be calculated using the formula for capacitors in series.

This explanation covers both theoretical derivations and practical applications of capacitance calculations.
