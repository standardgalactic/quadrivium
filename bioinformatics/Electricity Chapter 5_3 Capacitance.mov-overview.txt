The text discusses calculating the capacitance of an isolated sphere and handling capacitors in parallel and series.

1. **Capacitance of an Isolated Sphere:**
   - The capacitance \( C \) of an isolated sphere can be derived using algebraic manipulation, leading to the formula:
     \[
     C = 4\pi\varepsilon_0 R
     \]
   where \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space and \( R \) is the radius of the sphere.

2. **Capacitors in Parallel:**
   - For capacitors connected in parallel, their total capacitance \( C_{\text{total}} \) is the sum of individual capacitances:
     \[
     C_{\text{parallel}} = C_1 + C_2
     \]
   - The potential difference across each capacitor remains the same.

3. **Capacitors in Series:**
   - For capacitors connected in series, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual capacitances:
     \[
     \frac{1}{C_{\text{series}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
     \]
   - The charge on each capacitor remains constant.

4. **Example Problem:**
   - Given a circuit with capacitors \( C_1 = 12 \, \mu F \), \( C_2 = 5.3 \, \mu F \) in parallel, and \( C_3 = 4.5 \, \mu F \) in series:
     - First, find the equivalent capacitance of the parallel combination:
       \[
       C_{12} = C_1 + C_2 = 17.3 \, \mu F
       \]
     - Then, calculate the total capacitance with \( C_3 \) in series:
       \[
       \frac{1}{C_{123}} = \frac{1}{C_{12}} + \frac{1}{C_3} = \frac{1}{17.3 \times 10^{-6}} + \frac{1}{4.5 \times 10^{-6}}
       \]
     - Solving gives \( C_{123} = 3.57 \, \mu F \).

This summary covers the key points and calculations presented in the text regarding capacitors and their configurations.
