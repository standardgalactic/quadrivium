The provided text details the steps involved in multiplying two matrices with complex number entries. The matrices \( A \) and \( C \) are given as:

\[ 
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 + i & 3 \\ 2 + i & -i & 7 \end{bmatrix} 
\]

and 

\[ 
C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 + 2i \\ i & 1 \end{bmatrix}. 
\]

Since \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 3 \) matrix and \( C \) is a \( 3 \times 2 \) matrix, the resulting product \( A \times C \) will be a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The text then breaks down the calculation of each element in this resultant matrix:

1. **First Row, First Column:**
   - Calculated as \( (1 \cdot 1) + ((2+i) \cdot 2) + (3 \cdot i) = 5 + 5i \).

2. **First Row, Second Column:**
   - Calculated as \( (1 \cdot (4+2i)) + ((2+i) \cdot 1) + (3 \cdot 1) = 9 + 3i \).

3. **Second Row, First Column:**
   - Calculated as \( ((2+i) \cdot 1) + (-i \cdot 2) + (7 \cdot i) = 2 + 6i \).

4. **Second Row, Second Column:**
   - Calculated as \( ((2+i) \cdot (4+2i)) + (-i \cdot 1) + (7 \cdot 1) = 13 + 7i \).

The resulting matrix from the multiplication is:

\[
A \times C = \begin{bmatrix} 5 + 5i & 9 + 3i \\ 2 + 6i & 13 + 7i \end{bmatrix}
\]

The text highlights the complexity and potential for arithmetic errors when performing such calculations manually, especially with complex numbers. It suggests using Python to perform these matrix operations to reduce error and simplify the process. The text illustrates this by providing specific examples of complex arithmetic involved in calculating each element of the resulting matrix.
