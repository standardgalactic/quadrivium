The text provides an example of solving a first-order linear differential equation with a piecewise-defined function. The equation given is \( y' + y = f(x) \), where:

- \( f(x) = 1 \) for \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \)
- \( f(x) = 0 \) for \( x > 1 \)

The initial condition is \( y(0) = 0 \).

### Solution Process

1. **Interval \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \):**

   - The differential equation becomes \( y' + y = 1 \).
   - The integrating factor is \( e^x \), derived from the coefficient of \( y \) in the standard form.
   - Multiplying through by the integrating factor, we get:
     \[
     e^x y' + e^x y = e^x
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}(e^x y) = e^x
     \]
   - Integrating both sides gives:
     \[
     e^x y = e^x + C
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \), we have:
     \[
     y = 1 + Ce^{-x}
     \]
   - Using the initial condition \( y(0) = 0 \):
     \[
     0 = 1 + C \cdot 1 \Rightarrow C = -1
     \]
   - Thus, for \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), the solution is:
     \[
     y = 1 - e^{-x}
     \]

2. **Interval \( x > 1 \):**

   - The differential equation becomes \( y' + y = 0 \).
   - Using the same integrating factor \( e^x \):
     \[
     e^x y' + e^x y = 0
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}(e^x y) = 0
     \]
   - Integrating gives:
     \[
     e^x y = C_2
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \), we have:
     \[
     y = C_2 e^{-x}
     \]

3. **Continuity at \( x = 1 \):**

   - To ensure continuity at \( x = 1 \), match the solutions from both intervals.
   - From \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), \( y(1) = 1 - e^{-1} \).
   - For \( x > 1 \), \( y(1) = C_2 e^{-1} \).
   - Set these equal for continuity:
     \[
     C_2 e^{-1} = 1 - e^{-1}
     \]
   - Solving for \( C_2 \):
     \[
     C_2 = (1 - e^{-1})e
     \]

### Final Solution

- For \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \):
  \[
  y = 1 - e^{-x}
  \]

- For \( x > 1 \):
  \[
  y = (e - 1)e^{-x}
  \]

The solution is continuous at \( x = 1 \).

The text describes a scenario involving a function, \( x = 1 \), and discusses its behavior as part of a solution. The solution extends from 0 to 1, featuring a cusp at \( x = 1 \). Among multiple possible solutions on one side of the function, the focus is on selecting the particular solution that connects seamlessly with the original function precisely at \( x = 1 \).

The text provides a detailed solution to a differential equation with a piecewise-defined forcing function and an initial condition. Here's a summary:

1. **Differential Equation:** The problem involves solving the first-order linear differential equation \( y' + y = f(x) \), where \( f(x) \) is piecewise defined:
   - \( f(x) = 1 \) for \( 0 \leq x < 1 \)
   - \( f(x) = 0 \) for \( x > 1 \)

2. **Initial Condition:** The initial condition given is \( y(0) = 0 \).

3. **Integrating Factor:** To solve the differential equation, an integrating factor of \( e^x \) is used.

4. **Solution in Intervals:**
   - For \( 0 \leq x < 1 \):
     - The solution derived is \( y = 1 - \frac{1}{e^x} \).
     - This satisfies the initial condition at \( x = 0 \).

   - For \( x > 1 \):
     - The differential equation simplifies to a homogeneous form, leading to a general solution of \( y = c_2 e^{-x} \).

5. **Continuity Requirement:** To ensure continuity at \( x = 1 \), the solutions from both intervals are matched:
   - At \( x = 1 \) for the first interval: \( y(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{e} \).
   - The solution for \( x > 1 \) must match this value at \( x = 1 \), leading to \( c_2 e^{-1} = 1 - \frac{1}{e} \).
   - Solving for \( c_2 \) gives \( c_2 = e - 1 \).

6. **Final Solution:**
   - For \( 0 \leq x < 1 \): \( y = 1 - \frac{1}{e^x} \)
   - For \( x > 1 \): \( y = (e - 1) e^{-x} \)

This ensures the solution is continuous at \( x = 1 \), providing a complete piecewise solution to the differential equation.

The text describes a situation involving a solution for an equation or problem with \(x = 1\). The solution starts from 0 and increases to 1, where it encounters a cusp as it transitions to another function. Among various possible solutions on that side of the cusp, the specific desired solution is the one that seamlessly connects at \(x = 1\) to maintain continuity.
