The text provides an example of solving a first-order linear differential equation with a piecewise-defined function. The equation given is \( y' + y = f(x) \), where:

- \( f(x) = 1 \) for \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \)
- \( f(x) = 0 \) for \( x > 1 \)

The initial condition is \( y(0) = 0 \).

### Solution Process

1. **Interval \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \):**

   - The differential equation becomes \( y' + y = 1 \).
   - The integrating factor is \( e^x \), derived from the coefficient of \( y \) in the standard form.
   - Multiplying through by the integrating factor, we get:
     \[
     e^x y' + e^x y = e^x
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}(e^x y) = e^x
     \]
   - Integrating both sides gives:
     \[
     e^x y = e^x + C
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \), we have:
     \[
     y = 1 + Ce^{-x}
     \]
   - Using the initial condition \( y(0) = 0 \):
     \[
     0 = 1 + C \cdot 1 \Rightarrow C = -1
     \]
   - Thus, for \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), the solution is:
     \[
     y = 1 - e^{-x}
     \]

2. **Interval \( x > 1 \):**

   - The differential equation becomes \( y' + y = 0 \).
   - Using the same integrating factor \( e^x \):
     \[
     e^x y' + e^x y = 0
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}(e^x y) = 0
     \]
   - Integrating gives:
     \[
     e^x y = C_2
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \), we have:
     \[
     y = C_2 e^{-x}
     \]

3. **Continuity at \( x = 1 \):**

   - To ensure continuity at \( x = 1 \), match the solutions from both intervals.
   - From \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), \( y(1) = 1 - e^{-1} \).
   - For \( x > 1 \), \( y(1) = C_2 e^{-1} \).
   - Set these equal for continuity:
     \[
     C_2 e^{-1} = 1 - e^{-1}
     \]
   - Solving for \( C_2 \):
     \[
     C_2 = (1 - e^{-1})e
     \]

### Final Solution

- For \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \):
  \[
  y = 1 - e^{-x}
  \]

- For \( x > 1 \):
  \[
  y = (e - 1)e^{-x}
  \]

The solution is continuous at \( x = 1 \).

The text describes a scenario involving a function, \( x = 1 \), and discusses its behavior as part of a solution. The solution extends from 0 to 1, featuring a cusp at \( x = 1 \). Among multiple possible solutions on one side of the function, the focus is on selecting the particular solution that connects seamlessly with the original function precisely at \( x = 1 \).
