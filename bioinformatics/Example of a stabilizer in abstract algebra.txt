So in the previous video we looked at what the stabilizer is of an element of a set when we act
when we act with a set of a group on onto that element and I want to show you a tangible example
and it's a type of a group that we haven't looked at before specifically but I'm going to just do
that I'm going to take a square so it's square that side equals that side although angles 90
degrees I'm going to call this corner 1 corner 2 corner 3 corner 4 with side 1 side 2 side 3
and side 4 and I'm going to have diagonal 1 and I'm going to have diagonal diagonal 2
oop diagonal 2 you see that and let's just think about if we fix certain points how can we rotate
this thing and we're going to call row you know row is an RHO row row 0 is I do nothing to it and that's
going to be our identity element row 1 is I stick a pin there and I rotate it anti-clockwise by 90
degrees so 1 goes to 2 3 goes to 4 4 you know it turns around like that so that is just the
identity element I'm going to rotate counterclockwise by pi over 2 row 2 is I'm going to rotate by 180
degrees row 3 is 3 pi over 2 so 270 degrees mu 1 is mu 1 is what I'm going to do with mu 1 I'm going
to flip it around a certain axis let's flip it around let's say for our example here I'm going
to say let's let's just do that as vertical so I'm going to flip it around that axis so I keep it like
that and I flip it around that axis and mu 2 is I'm going to flip it around this axis so I go up and I'm
going to have d1 let's have d1 as I stick it there and I flip it around that axis and d2 I flip it
around that axis so d1 d1 I drew this way d3 that way so I mean we can mix these two up but for now
let's just imagine that that is our picture so I'm going to suggest that I have my group it's actually
called d4 it's a group and it has these elements row 0 row 1 sorry row 2 row 3 mu 1 mu 2 and delta 1
and delta 2 and I have my binary operation is that I have this composition of two of these so first I
rotate clockwise 90 degrees and then I flip around that axis so I'm not going to prove that
for you Kayleigh's table that this is a group let's just take for granted that it is a group and my
set a is this going to be my sides my corners one two three four my sides side one side two side three
side four and my diagonals one and my diagonal two so that's what I have now let's just look at
the stabilizer of corner one what will which one of these elements in my group of the set that makes
up my group will stabilize one that I can do any one of these and one will stay where it is definitely
row zero row zero is going to be everywhere remember we showed we proved that this is a subgroup so it's
got to be a group in its own right so the identity element is there what else will keep d1 in its place
well if I if I flip along if I fix those two points and I just flip along there so along this line
so d2 or I should not call that I should have called that delta 2 delta 1 and delta 2 so definitely
flipping around delta 2 is going to do that for me and those are the only two under that and then
under that binary operation as well so those two just keeping it on d2 and flipping it there is going
to do that for me let's take side number three what is going to keep side number three there again
the identity element but what about if I fix it along this axis here and I just flip it around now s3
turns around but s3 is still exactly where it is so definitely mu1 mu1 is going to be my other element
and so I have an identity element it is those two are those two will be the inverses of each
will be the inverses of each other so let's just look at well this one is its own inverse and that's its own inverse
I should really say let's now look at a more complicated one let's keep diagonal one let's keep diagonal one in its place well
first of all rho will be there but what if I just were to keep keep it there and flip it around itself
it will still be there so definitely definitely delta 1 will be there if I do this delta 2 and I flip it
around there d will flip around but it is still just where it is so definitely delta 2 will be there and
let's just think of of another one if if I just were to look at it and I were to rotate it through pi over
2 and another pi over 2 it stays there it's upside down but it's still there where it is so row 2 or
row 1 there row 2 there row 2 there is also going to be so have a look at this beautiful example take
take my word for it that that is a group and see if you agree with the stabilizers of
we looked at that element we looked at side three and we looked at diagonal one see if you agree with
what these stabilizers are of of those three elements of this set just to help you understand of cement
what a stabilizer is
