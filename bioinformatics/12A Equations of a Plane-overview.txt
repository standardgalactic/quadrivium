To find the equation of a plane given three points in space, you can follow these steps:

### Given Points
Let's denote the three points as \( P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) \), \( P_2(x_2, y_2, z_2) \), and \( P_3(x_3, y_3, z_3) \).

### Step 1: Find Two Vectors in the Plane
Construct two vectors that lie in the plane using these points:
- Vector \( \mathbf{v_1} = P_2 - P_1 = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1) \)
- Vector \( \mathbf{v_2} = P_3 - P_1 = (x_3 - x_1, y_3 - y_1, z_3 - z_1) \)

### Step 2: Find the Normal Vector
The normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \) to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of \( \mathbf{v_1} \) and \( \mathbf{v_2} \):
\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v_1} \times \mathbf{v_2} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
x_2 - x_1 & y_2 - y_1 & z_2 - z_1 \\
x_3 - x_1 & y_3 - y_1 & z_3 - z_1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculate the determinant:
- \( n_x = (y_2 - y_1)(z_3 - z_1) - (z_2 - z_1)(y_3 - y_1) \)
- \( n_y = (z_2 - z_1)(x_3 - x_1) - (x_2 - x_1)(z_3 - z_1) \)
- \( n_z = (x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (y_2 - y_1)(x_3 - x_1) \)

### Step 3: Equation of the Plane
The equation of the plane can be written using the normal vector \( \mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z) \) and a point on the plane, say \( P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) \):
\[
n_x(x - x_1) + n_y(y - y_1) + n_z(z - z_1) = 0
\]

Simplify to get:
\[
n_xx + n_yy + n_zz = d
\]
where \( d = n_xx_1 + n_yy_1 + n_zz_1 \).

### Example
Suppose the points are \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \), \( P_2(2, 3, 1) \), and \( P_3(3, 2, 2) \).

1. Vectors:
   - \( \mathbf{v_1} = (2-1, 3-2, 1+1) = (1, 1, 2) \)
   - \( \mathbf{v_2} = (3-1, 2-2, 2+1) = (2, 0, 3) \)

2. Normal vector:
   \[
   \mathbf{n} = 
   \begin{vmatrix}
   \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
   1 & 1 & 2 \\
   2 & 0 & 3
   \end{vmatrix}
   = (1 \cdot 3 - 2 \cdot 0)\mathbf{i} - (1 \cdot 3 - 2 \cdot 2)\mathbf{j} + (1 \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot 2)\mathbf{k}
   \]
   \[
   = (3)\mathbf{i} - (-1)\mathbf{j} - (2)\mathbf{k} = (3, 1, -2)
   \]

3. Plane equation:
   \[
   3(x - 1) + 1(y - 2) - 2(z + 1) = 0
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3x + y - 2z = 7
   \]

This is the equation of the plane passing through the given points.

The text explains different forms for representing the equation of a plane in three-dimensional space. Initially, it touches on deriving the equation by summing coefficients to equal zero but focuses on two main representations: point-normal form and vector form.

1. **Point-Normal Form**: This involves using a specific point on the plane and a normal vector perpendicular to the plane. It's described as the general form of the equation of a plane, where you know a point (x₀, y₀, z₀) and a normal vector (A, B, C).

2. **Vector Form**: The text then introduces the vector form of the equation of a plane:
   - Two points on the plane are chosen: P₀(x₀, y₀, z₀) and P(x, y, z).
   - Vectors R and R₀ are drawn from the origin to these points.
   - The difference vector (R - R₀) is computed.
   - This vector form states that the dot product of a normal vector with (R - R₀) equals zero.

The vector equation illustrates how vectors can describe planes by ensuring perpendicularity between a normal vector and any vector lying on the plane. It concludes by showing an example setup for this form without expanding it into the general scalar form, highlighting its utility in understanding geometric relationships within three-dimensional space.
