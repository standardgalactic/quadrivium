The text introduces the study of integration, which complements differentiation in calculus. While differentiation focuses on finding instantaneous rates of change or slopes, integration is concerned with calculating areas under graphs by summing up contributions from smaller parts. The mathematical essence of integration lies in determining areas.

The text provides examples of familiar geometric shapes such as circles and rectangles, for which area formulas are known. However, it poses a challenge to find the area of an irregular shape bounded by the y-axis, x-axis, and a curve defined by \(y = 1 - x^2\) within the first Cartesian quadrant.

The process of integration begins with understanding addition and sigma notation, building upon concepts like limits used in differentiation. The objective is to determine the area under the given curve, setting up for further exploration in subsequent discussions or instructional materials.
