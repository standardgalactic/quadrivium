The text explores the concept of cosets in group theory, particularly focusing on when left and right cosets are equal. This equality is guaranteed when a subgroup \( H \) is normal within a group \( G \). In an abelian group, commutativity ensures that all left and right cosets are naturally equal. For non-abelian groups, a subgroup \( H \) is normal if it remains invariant under conjugation by elements of \( G \); specifically, for any \( h \in H \) and \( g \in G \), the element \( g h g^{-1} \) still lies in \( H \). 

The text provides a proof outline to show that if \( H \) is normal, its left cosets are equal to its right cosets. This involves demonstrating that each coset can be expressed as a subset of the other, utilizing properties like conjugation.

Additionally, the concept of proving that one set forms a subgroup within another group is discussed. This involves showing that both left and right cosets are subsets of each other through binary operations with elements \( A \), \( H \), and their inverses. Conjugation plays a crucial role in demonstrating this equality by utilizing properties like rearranging inverses without affecting the proof.

The definition of normal subgroups is further elaborated, emphasizing that for a subgroup \( N \) to be normal in \( G \), it must satisfy \( gN = Ng \) for every element \( g \in G \). This property holds trivially in abelian groups due to commutativity. In non-abelian groups, the condition of being a normal subgroup ensures that left and right cosets are equal.

Overall, the text underscores the significance of normal subgroups in achieving equality between left and right cosets by their stability under conjugation within group theory.
