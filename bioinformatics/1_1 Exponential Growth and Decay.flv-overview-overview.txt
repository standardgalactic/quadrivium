The text provides an overview of first-order differential equations and their application in modeling exponential processes, specifically focusing on growth and decay scenarios.

1. **Exponential Growth**:
   - Defined by the differential equation \( \frac{dy}{dt} = ky \), where \( k \) is a positive constant.
   - The solution is given as \( y = ae^{kt} \), with \( a \) being the initial amount and \( e \) the base of natural logarithms.
   - An example in biology demonstrates bacterial growth, starting from 100 organisms and increasing to 450 in 60 minutes. By solving for \( k \) using the equation \( 4.5 = e^{60k} \), one can predict future organism numbers with \( y = 100e^{kt} \).
   - The model also covers calculating doubling times, illustrating that this time is constant regardless of initial conditions.

2. **Exponential Decay**:
   - Explained using carbon-14 decay as an example, characterized by a half-life of 5,730 years.
   - Starting with 50 grams of carbon-14, the equation \( y = 50 e^{kt} \) is used to determine remaining amounts over time.
   - The decay constant \( k \) is derived from the half-life using \( k = \frac{\ln(\frac{1}{2})}{5730} = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5730} \), indicating a negative rate due to decay.
   - For instance, the remaining amount after 100 years can be calculated by substituting \( t = 100 \) into the equation.

The text highlights how differential equations model both growth and decay in real-world applications like microbiology and radiocarbon dating.
