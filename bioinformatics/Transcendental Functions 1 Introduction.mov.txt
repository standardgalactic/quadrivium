Let's have a quick introductory look into logarithms. What does it mean if I
write log a of b equals c? Well that means a to the power c equals b. Let's
work that backwards and it might make more sense. If I write 2 to the power 3
equals 8. I can rewrite that in logarithmic form as log 2 8 equals. Logarithms are all about the power.
So this asks 2 to the power what will give me 8? Well 2 to the power 3 will give me 8. So the
answer there is 3. Let's look at an example which might clear things up a bit. If I write
as our example log 8 of it should be 8 log 8 of 2 equals x. What am I asking? I'm asking 8 to the
power what will give me 2? Let's write that. So 8 to the power what will give me 2? x is our unknown.
Well that is simple algebra. But as long as you can understand what this part means. It means
8 to the power what will give me 2. So 8 can be rewritten as 2 to the power 3. And that'll be
to the power x equals 2 to the power 1. So 2 to the power 3x equals 2 to the power 1. That means 3x
x equals 1 and x equals 1 and x equals 1 third. So log 8 of 2 equals 1 third. Because 8 to the power
1 third equals 2. So 1
