The text explains how to express acceleration using vectors associated with a curve, focusing on decomposing it into tangential and normal components. It introduces key vector concepts: the unit tangent vector (\( \mathbf{T} \)), principal normal unit vector (\( \mathbf{N} \)), and binormal unit vector.

Acceleration (\( \mathbf{r''}(t) \)) is split into two parts:

1. **Tangential Component**: This involves the second derivative of the arc length with respect to time (\( d^2s/dt^2 \)), multiplied by the unit tangent vector (\( \mathbf{T} \)).
   
2. **Normal Component**: This is related to curvature (\( \kappa \)) and is directed along the principal normal unit vector (\( \mathbf{N} \)). The expression \( \kappa \left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^2 \) shows how sharply a curve bends, with \( \kappa \) representing this curvature.

The acceleration formula is given by:
\[ \mathbf{a} = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} \mathbf{T} + \kappa \left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^2 \mathbf{N} \]

This decomposition helps in understanding motion along curves and aids in deriving curvature-related equations. The text highlights the elegance of mathematics in simplifying complex concepts into understandable parts, revealing underlying relationships.
