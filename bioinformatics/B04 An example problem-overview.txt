The text provides a step-by-step explanation of how to apply Euler's method and an improved version (often called Heun's method) for solving the differential equation \( y' = xy \), with initial conditions \( x_0 = 1 \) and \( y_0 = 1 \). The goal is to approximate the solution using discrete steps.

### Euler's Method:
1. **Initial Setup:** Start with \( x_0 = 1 \) and \( y_0 = 1 \).
2. **Step Size (h):** Choose a step size of 1 for simplicity.
3. **Iteration Process:**
   - For \( n = 0 \), calculate the slope using \( f(x_0, y_0) = x_0 \cdot y_0 = 1 \times 1 = 1 \).
   - Update to get \( y_1 = y_0 + h \times f(x_0, y_0) = 1 + 1 \times 1 = 2 \), and \( x_1 = x_0 + h = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), calculate the slope at this new point: \( f(x_1, y_1) = x_1 \cdot y_1 = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).
   - Update to get \( y_2 = y_1 + h \times f(x_1, y_1) = 2 + 1 \times 4 = 6 \), and \( x_2 = x_1 + h = 3 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), calculate the slope: \( f(x_2, y_2) = x_2 \cdot y_2 = 3 \times 6 = 18 \).

### Improved Euler's Method (Heun's Method):
1. **Initial Setup:** Same as before with \( x_0 = 1 \), \( y_0 = 1 \).
2. **Step Size (h):** Still use a step size of 1.
3. **Iteration Process:**
   - For each point, calculate the slope at the current position using Euler's method to get an intermediate value (fake y).
   - Use these slopes to improve the approximation:
     - Calculate the initial slope \( f(x_n, y_n) \).
     - Predict a new y-value using Euler's step: \( y_{\text{Euler}} = y_n + h \times f(x_n, y_n) \).
     - Calculate the slope at this predicted point: \( f(x_{n+1}, y_{\text{Euler}}) \).
     - Average these two slopes and use it to update:
       \[
       y_{n+1} = y_n + h \times \frac{f(x_n, y_n) + f(x_{n+1}, y_{\text{Euler}})}{2}
       \]
   - For \( n = 0 \), the initial slope is 1. Predicting with Euler gives \( y_{\text{Euler}} = 2 \). The second slope at \( (x_1, y_{\text{Euler}}) = (2, 2) \) is also 4.
   - Update: \( y_1 = 1 + 1 \times \frac{1 + 4}{2} = 3 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), the initial slope is 6. Predicting with Euler gives \( y_{\text{Euler}} = 9 \). The second slope at \( (x_2, y_{\text{Euler}}) = (3, 9) \) is 27.
   - Update: \( y_2 = 3 + 1 \times \frac{6 + 27}{2} = 16.5 \).

The improved method generally provides a more accurate approximation by considering the slope at both the current and predicted points.

The text provides an explanation and demonstration of both Euler's method and the improved (or Heun’s) Euler method for solving ordinary differential equations numerically, using a specific example.

1. **Euler’s Method:**
   - The example given is \( y' = xy \), with initial values \( x_0 = 1 \) and \( y_0 = 1 \).
   - Euler's method updates the solution by approximating the next value of \( y \) using the formula:
     \[
     y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n)
     \]
   - With a step size \( h = 1 \), the calculations proceed as follows:
     - For \( n = 0 \): \( x_0 = 1 \), \( y_0 = 1 \); calculate \( f(1, 1) = 1 \times 1 = 1 \).
       \[
       y_1 = 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 2
       \]
     - For \( n = 1 \): \( x_1 = 2 \), \( y_1 = 2 \); calculate \( f(2, 2) = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).
       \[
       y_2 = 2 + 1 \cdot 4 = 6
       \]
     - For \( n = 2 \): \( x_2 = 3 \), \( y_2 = 6 \); calculate \( f(3, 6) = 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
       \[
       y_3 = 6 + 1 \cdot 18 = 24
       \]

2. **Improved Euler's Method (Heun’s Method):**
   - This method refines the approximation by considering both the slope at the current point and an estimate of the slope at the next point.
   - The formula is:
     \[
     y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot \left(\frac{f(x_n, y_n) + f(x_n + h, y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n))}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Using the same step size \( h = 1 \):
     - For \( n = 0 \): Calculate initial slope \( f(1, 1) = 1 \).
       - Predicted next value using Euler's method: \( y^* = 1 + 1 \times 1 = 2 \).
       - Slope at predicted point: \( f(2, 2) = 4 \).
       - Improved slope: Average of initial and predicted slopes:
         \[
         y_1 = 1 + 1 \cdot \left(\frac{1 + 4}{2}\right) = 3
         \]
     - For \( n = 1 \): Calculate initial slope \( f(2, 3) = 6 \).
       - Predicted next value: \( y^* = 3 + 1 \times 6 = 9 \).
       - Slope at predicted point: \( f(3, 9) = 27 \).
       - Improved slope:
         \[
         y_2 = 3 + 1 \cdot \left(\frac{6 + 27}{2}\right) = 16.5
         \]
     - For \( n = 2 \): Calculate initial slope \( f(3, 16.5) = 49.5 \).
       - Predicted next value: \( y^* = 16.5 + 1 \times 49.5 = 66 \).
       - Slope at predicted point: \( f(4, 66) = 264 \).
       - Improved slope:
         \[
         y_3 = 16.5 + 1 \cdot \left(\frac{49.5 + 264}{2}\right) = 164.75
         \]

The improved method provides a more accurate estimate by averaging the slopes, thus reducing errors present in Euler's simpler approach.
