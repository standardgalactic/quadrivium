The text provides a step-by-step explanation of how to apply Euler's method and an improved version (often called Heun's method) for solving the differential equation \( y' = xy \), with initial conditions \( x_0 = 1 \) and \( y_0 = 1 \). The goal is to approximate the solution using discrete steps.

### Euler's Method:
1. **Initial Setup:** Start with \( x_0 = 1 \) and \( y_0 = 1 \).
2. **Step Size (h):** Choose a step size of 1 for simplicity.
3. **Iteration Process:**
   - For \( n = 0 \), calculate the slope using \( f(x_0, y_0) = x_0 \cdot y_0 = 1 \times 1 = 1 \).
   - Update to get \( y_1 = y_0 + h \times f(x_0, y_0) = 1 + 1 \times 1 = 2 \), and \( x_1 = x_0 + h = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), calculate the slope at this new point: \( f(x_1, y_1) = x_1 \cdot y_1 = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).
   - Update to get \( y_2 = y_1 + h \times f(x_1, y_1) = 2 + 1 \times 4 = 6 \), and \( x_2 = x_1 + h = 3 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), calculate the slope: \( f(x_2, y_2) = x_2 \cdot y_2 = 3 \times 6 = 18 \).

### Improved Euler's Method (Heun's Method):
1. **Initial Setup:** Same as before with \( x_0 = 1 \), \( y_0 = 1 \).
2. **Step Size (h):** Still use a step size of 1.
3. **Iteration Process:**
   - For each point, calculate the slope at the current position using Euler's method to get an intermediate value (fake y).
   - Use these slopes to improve the approximation:
     - Calculate the initial slope \( f(x_n, y_n) \).
     - Predict a new y-value using Euler's step: \( y_{\text{Euler}} = y_n + h \times f(x_n, y_n) \).
     - Calculate the slope at this predicted point: \( f(x_{n+1}, y_{\text{Euler}}) \).
     - Average these two slopes and use it to update:
       \[
       y_{n+1} = y_n + h \times \frac{f(x_n, y_n) + f(x_{n+1}, y_{\text{Euler}})}{2}
       \]
   - For \( n = 0 \), the initial slope is 1. Predicting with Euler gives \( y_{\text{Euler}} = 2 \). The second slope at \( (x_1, y_{\text{Euler}}) = (2, 2) \) is also 4.
   - Update: \( y_1 = 1 + 1 \times \frac{1 + 4}{2} = 3 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), the initial slope is 6. Predicting with Euler gives \( y_{\text{Euler}} = 9 \). The second slope at \( (x_2, y_{\text{Euler}}) = (3, 9) \) is 27.
   - Update: \( y_2 = 3 + 1 \times \frac{6 + 27}{2} = 16.5 \).

The improved method generally provides a more accurate approximation by considering the slope at both the current and predicted points.
