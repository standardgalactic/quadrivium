The text provides instructions for displaying images in Python using two different libraries: `matplotlib` and `PIL` (Pillow), followed by an explanation of concepts related to physics problems involving parametric equations for position and velocity vectors.

### Displaying Images with Python

#### Method 1: Using Matplotlib
- **Installation**: Install matplotlib using pip (`pip install matplotlib`).
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import matplotlib.image as mpimg

  # Load the image file
  image = mpimg.imread('your_image_file.png')  # Replace with your actual image path

  # Display the image
  plt.imshow(image)
  plt.axis('off')  # Hide axis labels and ticks
  plt.show()
  ```

#### Method 2: Using PIL (Pillow)
- **Installation**: Install Pillow using pip (`pip install pillow`).
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  from PIL import Image

  # Open the image file
  image = Image.open('your_image_file.png')  # Replace with your actual image path

  # Display the image
  image.show()
  ```

### Physics Problem Explanation: Velocity and Position Vectors

The text describes a physics problem involving parametric equations for motion in two dimensions:

1. **Position Vector**: 
   - Given by \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (-\cos(2t), \sin(2t))\).
   - This represents circular motion with radius 1, completing the circle twice as \( t \) ranges from 0 to \(\pi\).

2. **Velocity Vector**: 
   - Derived by differentiating the position vector: \(\mathbf{v}(t) = (2\sin(2t), 2\cos(2t))\).
   
3. **Orthogonality**:
   - The dot product of the position and velocity vectors is zero, indicating they are orthogonal.
   - This orthogonality implies that the motion is circular, with the velocity vector always tangent to the path.

### Vector Operations and Geometry

- **Dot Product**: Calculated as \( x_1 \times x_2 + y_1 \times y_2 \). If zero, vectors are orthogonal.
- **Orthogonality in Motion**: For circular motion, the position and velocity vectors being orthogonal means the radius (magnitude of the position vector) is constant.
- **Vector Norms and Angles**: The dot product can also be expressed as the product of magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between vectors.

### Differentiation for Acceleration

- The acceleration vector is obtained by differentiating the velocity vector, resulting in \((4\cos(2t), -4\sin(2t))\).
- This demonstrates differentiation of vector-valued functions using symbolic computation tools like SymPy.

Overall, the text covers basic image display techniques in Python and provides insights into vector operations and their applications in physics problems involving circular motion.
