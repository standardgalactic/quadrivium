This text provides an overview of the management strategies for enlarged thyroids and thyroid nodules. It emphasizes proper investigation of each case, with regular sonographic follow-up recommended for small, asymptomatic goiters.

For symptomatic cases where size is a concern, thyroxine suppressive therapy can be considered. Although initial studies showed mixed results regarding its efficacy in shrinking nodules, later trials indicated it could lead to significant shrinkage. However, since most nodules regrow after treatment stops, long-term use of thyroxine raises safety concerns, particularly regarding heart and bone health.

Thyroxine is not recommended for differentiating between hyperplastic and neoplastic nodules until a thorough workup confirms benignity. If thyroxine therapy fails, alternatives include radioactive iodine therapy or surgery.

Radioactive iodine therapy has proven effective in reducing thyroid size and is now considered a viable alternative to surgery, particularly because it avoids the risks associated with surgical interventions. Despite some exaggerated fears about its effects on tracheal compression, studies have shown no significant volume increase post-treatment. However, there are side effects and contraindications to consider.

Surgery remains the primary option for symptomatic patients, offering benefits such as histological evaluation, avoidance of radiation exposure, single-stage treatment, and a low recurrence risk. The choice among surgical options depends on various factors, with total thyroidectomy often preferred by experienced surgeons due to its lower chance of recurrence, despite an increased likelihood of hypothyroidism.

In summary, the management of enlarged thyroids involves careful evaluation, consideration of thyroxine therapy, radioactive iodine treatment, and surgery as potential interventions, each with specific indications and considerations.
