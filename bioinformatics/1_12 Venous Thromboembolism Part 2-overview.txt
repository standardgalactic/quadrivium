This text provides an overview of venous thromboembolism (VTE), focusing on its natural history, propagation, and prevention strategies. VTE encompasses conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if untreated. The disease often begins in the infrapopliteal veins or calf muscle venous sinuses.

The text highlights challenges in understanding VTE's natural history, such as determining when DVT propagates or leads to PE, since some cases of PE occur without visible DVT propagation beyond the knee. Studies show that while 70% of DVT cases resolve within six months via ultrasound, many patients experience lasting vessel damage.

Treatment for PE typically begins within hours or days of symptoms due to its high early mortality rate. Long-term outcomes depend more on underlying conditions like cancer or severe trauma. Prophylaxis aims to reduce VTE morbidity and mortality by identifying at-risk patients and choosing appropriate preventive measures. Options include unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), oral anticoagulants like warfarin, antiplatelet agents, pneumatic compression stockings, elastic stockings, and inferior vena cava (IVC) filters.

Research suggests LMWH is preferable for VTE prophylaxis due to its efficacy and lower bleeding risk compared to unfractionated heparin. In surgeries with high bleeding risks, such as neurosurgery, alternative measures like compression stockings might be preferred. The risk of VTE persists post-discharge, suggesting continued prophylactic measures may benefit certain patients.

Various guidelines help identify individuals requiring prophylaxis, extending beyond surgical contexts to include those with conditions like cancer. Resources such as pamphlets and smartphone apps assist healthcare providers in assessing patient risk profiles for appropriate VTE prevention.
