The text discusses solving a differential equation using separation of variables, where \( \frac{1}{y^2 - 4} \, dy = dx \). The process involves:

1. **Separating Variables**: Rearranging and integrating both sides.
   
2. **Handling the Denominator**: Recognizing that \( y^2 - 4 = (y-2)(y+2) \), which implies \( y \neq \pm 2 \).

3. **Partial Fractions**: Decomposing into partial fractions:
   \[
   \frac{1}{(y-2)(y+2)} = \frac{a}{y-2} + \frac{b}{y+2}
   \]
   Solving for \( a \) and \( b \), we find \( a = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( b = -\frac{1}{4} \).

4. **Integration**: Integrating both sides:
   \[
   \int \left( \frac{1}{4(y-2)} - \frac{1}{4(y+2)} \right) dy = \int dx
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \ln |y-2| - \frac{1}{4} \ln |y+2| = x + c_1
   \]

5. **Simplifying**: Using properties of logarithms:
   \[
   \ln \left| \frac{y-2}{y+2} \right| = 4x + c_2
   \]
   Exponentiating both sides gives:
   \[
   \frac{y-2}{y+2} = c_3 e^{4x}
   \]

6. **Solving for \( y \)**: Rearranging to solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 2 \frac{1 + ce^{4x}}{1 - ce^{4x}}
   \]
   where \( c = e^{c_2} \).

7. **Lost Solutions**: The solutions \( y = \pm 2 \) were lost due to the separation of variables. \( y = 2 \) can be obtained by setting \( c = 0 \). However, there is no value of \( c \) that yields \( y = -2 \), so it must be included as a singular solution.

In summary, the general solution is:
\[ 
y = 2 \frac{1 + ce^{4x}}{1 - ce^{4x}}
\]
with \( y = -2 \) as an additional singular solution.

The problem involves solving a differential equation using separation of variables, focusing on identifying and incorporating lost solutions. The equation given is:

\[ \frac{1}{y^2 - 4} \, dy = dx \]

By separating variables and integrating both sides, the solution process involves partial fraction decomposition:

\[ \frac{1}{y^2 - 4} = \frac{1/4}{y-2} - \frac{1/4}{y+2} \]

Integrating both sides yields:

\[ \ln |y-2| - \ln |y+2| = 4x + c_2 \]

Using properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:

\[ \ln \left|\frac{y-2}{y+2}\right| = 4x + c_2 \]

Exponentiating both sides gives:

\[ \frac{y-2}{y+2} = c_3 e^{4x} \]

Solving for \( y \), we find:

\[ y = \frac{2(1 + ce^{4x})}{1 - ce^{4x}} \]

where \( c \) is a constant. The solutions include the family of functions described by this equation and two singular solutions: \( y = 2 \) and \( y = -2 \).

The solution \( y = 2 \) can be obtained by setting \( c = 0 \). However, there is no value of \( c \) that results in \( y = -2 \), so it must be added separately as a singular solution. Thus, the complete solution set includes:

1. The family of solutions: \( y = \frac{2(1 + ce^{4x})}{1 - ce^{4x}} \)
2. Singular solutions: \( y = 2 \) and \( y = -2 \)

This approach ensures that all potential solutions are accounted for, even those lost during the separation of variables process.
