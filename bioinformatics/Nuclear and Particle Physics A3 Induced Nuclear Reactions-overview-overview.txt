The text discusses induced nuclear reactions, which involve external particles or radiation causing changes in atomic nuclei. Unlike spontaneous decay, these reactions require an incident particle such as a proton, neutron, or gamma ray to collide with a target nucleus, inducing transformation. A key outcome of these interactions is transmutation, where one element is converted into another by changing its atomic number.

Several key principles govern induced nuclear reactions:

1. **Conservation Laws**: The reactions must adhere to conservation laws, including the total number of protons and neutrons (nuclear number) and electric charge.
2. **Examples**:
   - Nitrogen-14 struck by an alpha particle becomes oxygen-17 plus a proton.
   - Boron-10 hit by a proton yields lithium-7 and an alpha particle.
   - A gamma ray hitting sodium-24 results in the same element, as it doesn't alter the number of protons or neutrons.

The creation of transuranium elements—those with atomic numbers greater than uranium (92), like neptunium and plutonium—demonstrates the power of induced nuclear reactions. These elements do not naturally occur on Earth but can be synthesized through such processes.

Example problems illustrate these concepts:
- Copper-63, when struck by an unknown particle, transforms into copper-62, a neutron, and a proton, forming a transient zinc-64 nucleus.
- Magnesium-24 hit by a neutron produces sodium-23 and a deuteron (a deuterium nucleus).

Overall, induced nuclear reactions are pivotal in creating new elements and isotopes, showcasing their transformative potential.
