The text discusses a physics problem involving the balance of forces on dust particles in a comet's tail. The key concepts include:

1. **Pressure vs. Force**: Pressure remains constant if the area changes because it is defined per unit area, while force changes directly with area.

2. **Comet Tails**: Comets have two tails: ion tails (charged particles) and dust tails (affected by electromagnetic forces).

3. **Balance of Forces**: The problem seeks to find when gravitational force on a dust particle equals the opposing force from electromagnetic waves due to solar radiation.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - Dust particles are tiny, with a given density (\(3.5 \times 10^3 \) kg/mÂ³).
   - They experience total absorption of solar energy.
   - The gravitational force is calculated using Newton's law of gravitation.

5. **Calculations**:
   - Intensity of sunlight is considered as power per unit area at a distance \( r \) from the sun.
   - The mass of a dust particle is derived from its density and volume (\(4/3\pi R^3\)).
   - The balance equation involves equating gravitational force to electromagnetic force, leading to an expression for the radius \( R \) of the particle.

6. **Result**: The radius \( R \) of the dust particle at which forces balance is independent of its distance from the sun and depends on solar power output, density, gravitational constant, mass of the sun, and speed of light.

The solution emphasizes understanding each component in the equation, particularly distinguishing between radial distance to the sun (\( r \)) and the radius of the particle (\( R \)).
