The text describes solving an initial value problem involving differential equations by using a strategic substitution to simplify the equation. Initially, the equation involves both \( y \) and \( x \), making it difficult to solve directly. By substituting \( u = -2x + y \), the problem is transformed into one in terms of \( u \) and \( x \), allowing for separation of variables.

The derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is expressed using the chain rule, revealing that the equation can be rewritten as \( 2 + \frac{du}{dx} = u^2 - 7 \). This form allows the separation of variables: 

\[
\frac{1}{u-3} - \frac{1}{6(u+3)} \, du = dx
\]

Integration yields:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \ln |u-3| - \frac{1}{6} \ln |u+3| = x + c_1
\]

Simplifying using logarithm properties gives:

\[
\ln \left|\frac{u-3}{u+3}\right| = 6x + c_2
\]

Exponentiating both sides results in:

\[
\frac{u-3}{u+3} = C e^{6x}
\]

Solving for \( u \) gives:

\[
u = \frac{3(1 + Ce^{6x})}{1 - Ce^{6x}}
\]

Substituting back \( u = -2x + y \), we find:

\[
y = 2x + \frac{3(1 + Ce^{6x})}{1 - Ce^{6x}}
\]

Applying the initial condition \( x = 0, y = 0 \) determines \( C = -1 \). The final solution is:

\[
y = 2x + \frac{3(1 - e^{6x})}{1 + e^{6x}}
\]

The text emphasizes that such substitutions require insight and practice, as there's no straightforward recipe for choosing the right substitution.
