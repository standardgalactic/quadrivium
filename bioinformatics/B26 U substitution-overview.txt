The text describes solving an initial value problem involving differential equations by using a strategic substitution to simplify the equation. Initially, the equation involves both \( y \) and \( x \), making it difficult to solve directly. By substituting \( u = -2x + y \), the problem is transformed into one in terms of \( u \) and \( x \), allowing for separation of variables.

The derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is expressed using the chain rule, revealing that the equation can be rewritten as \( 2 + \frac{du}{dx} = u^2 - 7 \). This form allows the separation of variables: 

\[
\frac{1}{u-3} - \frac{1}{6(u+3)} \, du = dx
\]

Integration yields:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \ln |u-3| - \frac{1}{6} \ln |u+3| = x + c_1
\]

Simplifying using logarithm properties gives:

\[
\ln \left|\frac{u-3}{u+3}\right| = 6x + c_2
\]

Exponentiating both sides results in:

\[
\frac{u-3}{u+3} = C e^{6x}
\]

Solving for \( u \) gives:

\[
u = \frac{3(1 + Ce^{6x})}{1 - Ce^{6x}}
\]

Substituting back \( u = -2x + y \), we find:

\[
y = 2x + \frac{3(1 + Ce^{6x})}{1 - Ce^{6x}}
\]

Applying the initial condition \( x = 0, y = 0 \) determines \( C = -1 \). The final solution is:

\[
y = 2x + \frac{3(1 - e^{6x})}{1 + e^{6x}}
\]

The text emphasizes that such substitutions require insight and practice, as there's no straightforward recipe for choosing the right substitution.

The text describes the process of solving a challenging initial value problem using a strategic substitution to simplify the differential equation. Initially, the equation involves both \( y \) and \( x \), making it difficult to solve directly. To tackle this, a substitution is introduced: let \( u = -2x + y \). This transforms the equation into one involving \( u \) and \( x \).

Through differentiation, \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is expressed in terms of \( \frac{du}{dx} \), simplifying the differential equation. The resulting form allows for separation of variables, making it possible to integrate both sides.

The integral requires partial fraction decomposition, where the expression is split into simpler fractions with coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). Solving these gives specific values that simplify further integration into natural logarithms.

After integrating, properties of logarithms are used to combine terms. The result is expressed in terms of an exponential function involving a constant \( c_2 \), which can be simplified by redefining constants. Substituting back for \( y \) yields the general solution.

The initial condition (\( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \)) is used to find the specific value of the constant, leading to the particular solution. The process underscores the importance of clever substitutions in solving complex differential equations and emphasizes that such techniques often require insight rather than a fixed method.
