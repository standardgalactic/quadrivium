To sketch the graph of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x+2} \), follow these steps:

1. **Plot Discontinuities**: Identify any discontinuities. The function has a vertical asymptote at \( x = -2 \) because the denominator becomes zero.

2. **Evaluate End Behavior**: As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \) approaches just over 1, and as \( x \to +\infty \), it approaches just under 1. Near \( x = -2 \), the function tends to positive infinity from the left and negative infinity from the right.

3. **Identify Intercepts**: The x-intercept is at \( x = -1 \) (where \( f(x) = 0 \)), and the y-intercept is at \( y = \frac{1}{2} \) (where \( x = 0 \)).

4. **Determine Turning Points**: The first derivative, \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{(x+2)^2} \), never equals zero, indicating no turning points and a consistent upward slope in both intervals.

5. **Evaluate Slope**: The function has a positive slope from \(-\infty\) to \(-2\) and from \(-2\) to \(+\infty\).

6. **Find Inflection Points**: The second derivative, \( f''(x) = -\frac{2}{(x+2)^3} \), never equals zero, indicating no inflection points.

7. **Concavity**: The graph is concave up from \(-\infty\) to \(-2\) and concave down from \(-2\) to \(+\infty\).

The focus is on understanding the function's behavior, including discontinuities, end behavior, derivatives, and concavity, rather than just sketching. Creating a table of values can help in plotting a more accurate graph. Understanding infinite values is key for successful graph sketching.
