then the other important one is Lee that they ask all the time in the
intermediate papers it seems the revised cardiac risk index it's all the same
stuff again high-risk surgery history of ischemic heart disease history of
congestive heart failure history of cerebrovascular disease insulin
requiring diabetes and your serum creatinine okay this is the Goldman
cardiac index but as I say it can basically be you know don't bother about
it it's yeah and then I'm not going to really go into optimization of patients
because I think that's a completely different topic again but the one thing
that's come up time and time and again in the articles that I've that I've read
was beta blocker therapy in patients with significant cardiovascular risk
factors MAPS have kindly pointed out that that if for a long time it has been
considered to reduce mortality especially in patients with known
coronary artery disease older than 65 and other risk factors like hypertension
diabetes and cholesterol but then the poise trial happened and that basically
showed an increased perioperative morbidity especially a high incidence in
strokes in patients that was treated with beta blockers so the current and yeah
current policy on beta blocker therapy is basically patients that's already on
beta blockers stay on the beta blockers and patients that is booked for vascular
surgery will then be initiated on beta blocker therapy one to two weeks prior
to surgery rest of the patients doesn't matter what the cardiovascular risk factor is we
don't initiate beta blocker therapy okay all right I don't know if there's anything
that you guys want to add in terms of cardiovascular risk assessment okay pulmonary risk assessment all
right we always focus very much on cardiovascular risk assessment but pulmonary complications is
actually 2.6 times more common than cardiac complications and or action and are likely to
be much more severe than your cardiovascular complications and interestingly your renal complications and your pulmonary complications are the two things that's been shown to be the best
the best predictors of long term morbidity and mortality and again the use of your ASA classification is shown to be one of the best predictors of pulmonary complications and ASA 2 and greater have a 1.5 to 3.2 fold increase of pulmonary complications
most common clinical significant significant complications is pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchospasm,
prolonged mechanical ventilation and exacerbation of pre-existing lung disease. I think if you think about pulmonary complications you really have to think from before the anesthetic, during the anesthetic intubation period, intraoperatively and then extubation and postoperatively.
you can have a whole area of complications happening in that time. Screening for your pulmonary risk factors again stay with basics, good history, a good clinical examination, once again direct observation of your patient's ability to tolerate physical activity, a simple chest x-ray and then pulmonary functions or spirometry is really only indicated in patients with known pulmonary disease like CO2 or
patients that smokes and then unexplained pulmonary symptoms. Arterial blood gas can be useful to evaluate preoperative hypoxia but it really never should be a contraindication to surgery and then again the link between the renal functions and pulmonary functions, your renal functions and nutritional status have been shown to be good predictors of pulmonary complications.
Albumin, with a low albumin, it's about your diminished reserve and then of course your decreased hydrostatic pressure,
that puts the patient at increased risk for pulmonary edema, two things to keep in mind when you're looking at pulmonary risk.
So, specific important risk factors in terms of pulmonary complications is patients, COPD is shown to be one of the most important factors in terms of pulmonary complications.
So, specific important risk factors in terms of pulmonary complications have been shown to be good predictors of pulmonary complications.
Spirometry is definitely indicated and this is one of the most important factors in the most important factors in terms of pulmonary complications.
So, specific important risk factors in terms of pulmonary complications is patients, COPD is shown to be one of the most important ones to look at.
Up to 28% of patients with COPD will definitely develop post pulmonary complications.
Spirometry is definitely indicated and this is one of the conditions that you can and should optimize preoperatively.
With a peak flow less than 80%, you have to treat with bronchodilators and a short course of steroids.
But don't forget preoperative physiotherapy with incentive spirometry, basically a pee bottle that they blow on,
and lung expansion manoeuvres can be really helpful.
So, this can be really helpful.
