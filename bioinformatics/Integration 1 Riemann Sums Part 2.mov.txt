Here we have an example using our original irregular shape and we have divided the area up into 4 squares.
As you can see the width of the basis using b minus a divided by n are now 1 minus 0 divided by 4 which is a quarter.
Again we have used upper sums for the heights of each rectangle.
To get our terminology closer to real integration we will write the f of c1 for our first y value
and in our example c1 would be where x equals 0 and we will write the f of c2 for the height of the second rectangle
the c2 where x equals a quarter and so on.
We will also write delta x for the width of each base.
This makes the total area for all the rectangles here the f of c1 times delta x plus the f of c2 times delta x plus the f of c3 times delta x plus the f of c4 times delta x.
As you can see that as you go to the premi says f of c1 times delta x minus 0 and then we will write it Before x 1 and 0,ексhof Question mark the f of c4 times a t4 times 13 cm ש
And that was when this is available to the star leaf from F4 timesa star Health audit study.
