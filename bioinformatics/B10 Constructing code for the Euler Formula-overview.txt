The text provides an introductory tutorial on using Python's IDLE to write and run simple numerical solutions, particularly focusing on solving differential equations with Euler's method. Here’s a summarized breakdown:

1. **Setting Up**: 
   - Open Python's IDLE application.
   - Initialize constants such as the initial values for \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Defining the Differential Equation**:
   - Set up a simple linear differential equation: \( m = 3xy \).

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - Print initial values of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - Use a while loop to iterate until \( x \) reaches or exceeds 1.5.

4. **Euler's Method Implementation**:
   - Calculate the new value for \( y \) using: \( y = y + h \times m \), where \( h \) is the step size.
   - Update \( x \) with: \( x = x + h \).
   - Recalculate \( m \) after updating \( x \) and \( y \).

5. **Loop and Print**:
   - Continuously loop, recalculating values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( m \).
   - Print the updated \( x \) and \( y \) values at each step.

6. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when \( x \) is no longer less than 1.5.
   - Ensure calculations use previous \( x \) and \( y \) to maintain correctness in Euler’s method by updating \( y \) before \( x \).

This tutorial emphasizes understanding the flow of programming logic, particularly handling loops and variable updates, while applying numerical methods to solve differential equations.
