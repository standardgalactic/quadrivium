The text provides an introductory tutorial on using Python's IDLE to write and run simple numerical solutions, particularly focusing on solving differential equations with Euler's method. Here’s a summarized breakdown:

1. **Setting Up**: 
   - Open Python's IDLE application.
   - Initialize constants such as the initial values for \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Defining the Differential Equation**:
   - Set up a simple linear differential equation: \( m = 3xy \).

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - Print initial values of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - Use a while loop to iterate until \( x \) reaches or exceeds 1.5.

4. **Euler's Method Implementation**:
   - Calculate the new value for \( y \) using: \( y = y + h \times m \), where \( h \) is the step size.
   - Update \( x \) with: \( x = x + h \).
   - Recalculate \( m \) after updating \( x \) and \( y \).

5. **Loop and Print**:
   - Continuously loop, recalculating values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( m \).
   - Print the updated \( x \) and \( y \) values at each step.

6. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when \( x \) is no longer less than 1.5.
   - Ensure calculations use previous \( x \) and \( y \) to maintain correctness in Euler’s method by updating \( y \) before \( x \).

This tutorial emphasizes understanding the flow of programming logic, particularly handling loops and variable updates, while applying numerical methods to solve differential equations.

The text describes how to use Python's IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) to solve numerical problems using Euler's method. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Starting with IDLE**:
   - Open the Python application, access the script editor through the menu options: Run > Edit > IDLE Script Editor.
   - Use the basic text editing features like Cut (CTRL + X), Paste (CTRL + V), Save (CTRL + S), and Exit (CTRL + Q).

2. **Understanding Euler's Method**:
   - Explain how to solve a differential equation numerically using Euler's method.
   - Define initial conditions for variables \(x\) and \(y\).
   - Use the formula: 
     \[
     y_{n+1} = y_n + h \times m
     \]
     where \(m = 3xy\) (the differential equation in this context).

3. **Implementing Euler's Method**:
   - Start by setting initial values for \(x\) and \(y\).
   - Implement a loop using the `while` statement to iterate until \(x < 1.5\).
   - Update \(y\) before updating \(x\) within each iteration of the loop, ensuring calculations use the correct previous values.
   - Calculate \(m\) at each step based on current \(x\) and \(y\).

4. **Running the Program**:
   - Save your script frequently using CTRL + S and execute it with function F5 or by selecting Run > Run Module.
   - The program will output pairs of \(x\) and \(y\) values, showing how they change as per Euler's method.

5. **Understanding Output**:
   - Observe the printed sequence of \(x\) and \(y\) values to see how \(y\) changes with each step size increment of \(h\).
   - The loop will continue until \(x\) reaches 1.5, inclusive of this endpoint due to the logic in the `while` condition.

Overall, the text guides through setting up a simple Python script to numerically solve differential equations using Euler's method, illustrating basic programming constructs and iterative calculations.
