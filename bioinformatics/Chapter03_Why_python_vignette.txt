So in the previous lecture you saw me use some Python.
Why on earth Python? Why do I use Python for all my analysis
and all my computer and scientific work?
There certainly is a lot of other software out there.
So in this lecture I just want to motivate for the use of Python.
Why I think it's such a wonderful tool.
I'll also show you how to install it so that you can work along in this lecture series.
Have a look.
I'll see you next time.
