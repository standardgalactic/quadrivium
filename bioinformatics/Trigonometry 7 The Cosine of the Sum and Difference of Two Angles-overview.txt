The text provides a geometric derivation for the cosine function when adding or subtracting angles, using a series of constructed lines and triangles.

1. **Setup**: A right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is used as the starting point. The line \( AC \) is extended to point \( F \), and from \( F \), a parallel line \( EF \) is drawn to side \( BC \). Another line \( ED \) is drawn parallel to \( ACF \), forming rectangle \( CDEF \).

2. **Angles and Parallels**: The angles are analyzed, noting that angle \( AED \) equals angle \( ACF \) (both equal to \( \alpha \)), and other angles are derived based on these parallels.

3. **Cosine of Sum of Angles**:
   - In triangle \( ABC \), the cosine of \( \alpha + \beta \) is expressed as a ratio involving sides \( AC \) and \( AB \).
   - Using parallel lines and similar triangles, this expression is rewritten in terms of segments \( AF, AE, ED, \) and \( BE \).

4. **Substitution**:
   - From right triangle \( AEF \), the cosine of \( \alpha \) is \( \frac{AF}{AE} \).
   - From right triangle \( ABE \), the cosine of \( \beta \) is \( \frac{AE}{AB} \).
   - From right triangle \( BDE \), the sine of \( \alpha \) is \( \frac{ED}{BE} \).

5. **Cosine Addition Formula**:
   - Substituting these ratios, the cosine of \( \alpha + \beta \) is derived as: 
     \[
     \cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta
     \]

6. **Cosine Subtraction Formula**:
   - Similarly, the formula for \( \cos(\alpha - \beta) \) is derived as:
     \[
     \cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
     \]

7. **Double Angle Formula**:
   - For \( \alpha = \beta \), the cosine of double angle \( 2\alpha \) is derived using the identity:
     \[
     \cos(2\alpha) = \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha
     \]
   - Using \( \sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1 \), it simplifies to:
     \[
     \cos(2\alpha) = 2\cos^2 \alpha - 1
     \]
   - Alternatively, using the sine identity:
     \[
     \cos(2\alpha) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha
     \]

This geometric approach provides a visual and intuitive understanding of trigonometric identities for angle addition, subtraction, and doubling.
