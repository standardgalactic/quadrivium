The text explains the concept of finding the inverse of a matrix by drawing an analogy to division in algebra. For a square (same number of rows and columns) and non-singular (nonzero determinant) matrix \(A\), there exists an inverse such that multiplying it by \(A\) yields the identity matrix \(I\). Not all matrices have inverses, as they must meet these criteria.

For 2x2 matrices, calculating the inverse involves first determining the determinant (\(AD - BC\)). If this is zero, the matrix has no inverse. For invertible 2x2 matrices, the formula for the inverse is:

\[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} 
\begin{bmatrix}
D & -B \\
-C & A
\end{bmatrix} \]

An example given involves a matrix \(A\) with elements \([3, 1; 4, 2]\), where the determinant is \(6 - 4 = 2\). The inverse is:

\[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -1 \\
-4 & 3
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -0.5 \\
-2 & 1.5
\end{bmatrix} \]

This example demonstrates the process for simple matrices, with a note that inversion becomes more complex for larger matrices.
