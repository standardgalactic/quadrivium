As promised, we will now discuss echelon forms.
Here's the example we finished up with before.
I called the form that this matrix was in row echelon form.
Here are the properties of row echelon form.
A matrix is in row echelon form if these three properties are met.
1. If a row does not consist entirely of zeros,
the first non-zero number in the row is a 1, called the leading 1.
Here we have three leading 1s.
2. If there are any rows consisting entirely of zeros,
they are grouped at the bottom of the matrix.
Here we have no such rows.
3. In any two successive rows that do not consist entirely of zeros,
the leading 1 in the lower row occurs farther down to the right
than the leading 1 in the higher row.
This 1 is farther to the right than that 1,
and this 1 farther to the right than that 1.
We can also continue with our elementary row operations
until our matrix satisfies this last property.
4. Each column that contains a leading 1
has zeros everywhere else in that column.
Here we don't have this property.
In this 1s column there is a 2 and a 3,
and in this a 2.
We will carry on to show this in the next video.
In this form we don't have to use back substitution.
We can read the answers directly from the matrix.
