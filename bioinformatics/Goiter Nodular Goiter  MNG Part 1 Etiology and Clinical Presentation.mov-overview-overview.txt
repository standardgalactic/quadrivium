The text provides an overview of non-toxic thyroid enlargement, known as goiter, encompassing its causes, symptoms, and prevalence. All forms—diffuse, uninodular, and multinodular—are grouped together under the umbrella term "non-toxic goiter." It is considered endemic in areas where over 5% of children have it, often due to iodine deficiency.

Historically, clinical assessments suggested a prevalence rate of 3-5%. However, modern ultrasonographic methods show much higher rates: diffuse goiters affect 30-50% and nodules up to 60%, especially in iodine-deficient areas and among the elderly. Autopsy studies reveal that over half may have thyroid nodules.

Distinguishing between benign and malignant nodular disease is challenging, particularly with incidental sonographic findings. While increased Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) due to mild hypothyroidism has been a traditional cause of goiter, not all iodine-deficient individuals develop it, pointing to genetic factors or intrathyroidal mechanisms.

Nodularity occurs when parts of the thyroid become more sensitive to TSH-dependent or independent pathways. Solitary nodules can be monoclonal (potentially early-stage cancer) or polyclonal. Non-toxic goiter is more common in women and is considered pathological if it occurs during adolescence, as physiological enlargement does not occur at this stage.

Symptoms include cosmetic concerns, neck discomfort, swallowing or breathing difficulties, choking sensations, and fears of cancer. Further exploration will cover investigations and management strategies for patients with these conditions.
