The text describes two separate problems related to sound waves.

### Problem 1: Sound Wave Travel Through Different Media

- **Scenario**: A metal rod is struck on one end while a listener is positioned at the other end. The sound travels through both the rod and air.
- **Given**:
  - Velocity of sound in air (\(v_2\)) = 343 m/s
  - Velocity of sound in the rod (\(v_1\)) = 15 times faster than in air (i.e., \(15 \times 343\) m/s)
  - Time difference between hearing the sound through the rod and air is used to calculate the distance.
- **Calculation**:
  - Let \(d\) be the length of the rod.
  - Time taken for sound to travel through air = \(t_2 = \frac{d}{v_2}\)
  - Time taken for sound to travel through the rod = \(t_1 = \frac{d}{v_1}\)
  - The difference in time (\(t_2 - t_1\)) is given as a known value, allowing calculation of \(d\).
- **Solution**: Use the equation \(d = \text{(difference in times)} \times v_2 \times v_1 / (v_1 - v_2)\) to find the length of the rod.

### Problem 2: Maximum Displacement for Human Hearing

- **Scenario**: Determine the maximum displacement (\(s_m\)) of air particles that corresponds to a change in pressure detectable by human ears.
- **Given**:
  - Maximum change in pressure (\(\Delta p_{max}\)) = 28 Pa
  - Density of air (\(\rho\)) = 1.21 kg/mÂ³
  - Frequency of sound (\(f\)) = 1000 Hz
  - Velocity of sound (\(v\)) = 343 m/s
- **Equation**: \(\Delta p_{max} = v \cdot \rho \cdot \omega \cdot s_m\)
  - Where \(\omega = 2\pi f\) (angular frequency).
- **Calculation**:
  - Substitute the known values into the equation to solve for \(s_m\):
    \[
    s_m = \frac{\Delta p_{max}}{v \cdot \rho \cdot 2\pi f}
    \]
- **Solution**: The maximum displacement (\(s_m\)) is approximately \(1.1 \times 10^{-5}\) meters.

Both problems involve applying principles of wave motion and sound propagation to solve for specific parameters related to sound waves in different contexts.
