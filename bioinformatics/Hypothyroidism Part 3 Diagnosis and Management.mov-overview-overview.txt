This text outlines the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism. Diagnosis primarily depends on clinical evaluation and laboratory tests measuring thyroxine (T4), T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Sintigraphy and sonography play a lesser role compared to hyperthyroidism.

**Diagnostic Points:**
- **Primary Hypothyroidism:** Characterized by high TSH and low thyroid hormones.
- **Central Hypothyroidism:** Identified by low TSH despite decreased thyroid hormones, necessitating further evaluation of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis and MRI scans.

**Clinical Scenarios:**
1. Non-compliance in thyroxine-treated patients can lead to misleading test results; patient honesty is essential.
2. Abnormal TFTs may occur post-severe illness without requiring treatment, as normalization typically occurs over time.

Thyroid antibodies are relevant for specific diagnoses, and lifelong hormone replacement is usually necessary unless the condition is temporary or drug-induced.

**Treatment Goals:**
- Aim to achieve a euthyroid state with an initial thyroxine dose of 6 mcg/kg/day, adjusted lower for elderly patients or those with coronary artery disease.
- Optimal absorption occurs on an empty stomach; food can reduce absorption by about 40%.
- Medications may affect thyroxine absorption and blood levels, requiring dosage adjustments.
- TSH monitoring every 4-6 weeks during initial treatment helps maintain levels in the lower normal range.

**Side Effects:**
- Allergic reactions to manufacturing compounds and serious effects from over-replacement are possible.
- Current studies show no significant benefit of combining T3 with thyroxine over monotherapy, though further research is ongoing.
