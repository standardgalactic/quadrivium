The text describes an alternative method for solving linear systems of equations using determinants, commonly known as Cramer's Rule. Here’s a summary:

1. **Introduction to Methods**: The discussion starts with two methods involving the identity matrix and determinants for solving linear systems. It then introduces Cramer's Rule as a third method.

2. **Cramer's Rule Explained**:
   - In Cramer's Rule, each variable \( x_i \) in the system is solved by dividing the determinant of a modified matrix \( A_i \) by the determinant of the original coefficient matrix \( A \).
   - Matrix \( A_i \) is derived from matrix \( A \) by replacing its \( i^{th} \) column with the constant terms vector \( B \).

3. **Example Construction**:
   - For a given matrix \( A \):
     \[
     A = \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 & -3 \\
     2 & 2 & -1 \\
     1 & -1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The vector \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \begin{bmatrix} -5 \\ 4 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Matrix \( A_1 \) is constructed by replacing the first column of \( A \) with \( B \):
     \[
     A_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
     -5 & 2 & -3 \\
     4 & 2 & -1 \\
     6 & -1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Similarly, matrices \( A_2 \) and \( A_3 \) are constructed by replacing the second and third columns of \( A \) with \( B \), respectively.

4. **Determinant Calculation**:
   - The determinant of matrix \( A \) is calculated using cofactors.
   - For example, choosing row one for expansion, the determinant calculation involves:
     \[
     \text{det}(A) = 3 - 10 + 12 = 5
     \]
   - This process can be streamlined by recognizing patterns in cofactor signs (positive or negative).

5. **Efficiency Tip**:
   - The text suggests that with practice, one can perform these calculations mentally by remembering the pattern of positive and negative signs in the matrix of cofactors.

Overall, Cramer's Rule provides a systematic way to solve linear systems using determinants, emphasizing the importance of understanding cofactor expansion for efficient computation.

The text provides a brief explanation of using Cramer's Rule to solve a system of linear equations by calculating determinants. The speaker calculates the determinant of matrix \( A \) as 5 and uses it to find solutions for variables \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \). Specifically, they determine \( x_1 = 1 \) by dividing a modified determinant (also 5) by 5. For \( x_2 \), the speaker indicates that its solution involves calculating another determinant divided by 5 to get 4. They conclude by encouraging solving for all variables using this method, expressing gratitude at the end.

The text introduces Cramer's Rule as a third method for solving linear systems of equations in addition to using the identity matrix or determinants. Here’s a summary:

1. **Cramer's Rule**: This rule offers a way to find solutions \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) for a system of linear equations \(Ax = B\), where \(A\) is the coefficient matrix and \(B\) is the constants vector.

2. **Determinants**: According to Cramer's Rule:
   - \(x_1\) is the determinant of matrix \(A_1\) (formed by replacing the first column of \(A\) with \(B\)) divided by the determinant of \(A\).
   - Similarly, \(x_2\) and \(x_3\) are found using matrices \(A_2\) and \(A_3\), which replace the second and third columns of \(A\) with \(B\).

3. **Matrix Construction**:
   - Matrix \(A_1\): Replace the first column of \(A\) with vector \(B\).
   - Matrix \(A_2\): Replace the second column.
   - Matrix \(A_3\): Replace the third column.

4. **Determinant Calculation**: 
   - The determinant of a matrix can be calculated using cofactor expansion along any row or column, ideally one with zeros to simplify calculations.
   - Each element in the chosen row/column is multiplied by its cofactor (determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the current row and column), considering signs according to position.

5. **Example**:
   - For matrix \(A\):
     \[
     A = \begin{bmatrix} 
     1 & 2 & -3 \\ 
     2 & 2 & -1 \\ 
     1 & -1 & 2 
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Vector \(B\) is \([-5, 4, 6]\).
   - The determinant of \(A\) is calculated using cofactor expansion.

6. **Efficiency**: While Cramer's Rule provides a direct method for finding solutions, it involves calculating multiple determinants, which can be computationally intensive for large systems.

The text emphasizes understanding the sign pattern in cofactors and efficiently performing calculations mentally or with minimal steps when possible.

The text explains a method called Cramer's Rule for solving systems of linear equations using determinants. It provides an example where the determinant of matrix 'a' is calculated to be five. To find \( X_1 \), the determinant of matrix one (obtained by replacing the first column of 'a' with constants from the equation) divided by the determinant of 'a' is used, resulting in a value of 1. Similarly, for \( X_2 \), dividing the determinant of matrix two by five gives the value four. The method can be extended to find other variables like \( X_3 \). The speaker emphasizes using determinants to solve each variable systematically.
