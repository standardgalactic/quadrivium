The text describes an alternative method for solving linear systems of equations using determinants, commonly known as Cramer's Rule. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Introduction to Methods**: The discussion starts with two methods involving the identity matrix and determinants for solving linear systems. It then introduces Cramer's Rule as a third method.

2. **Cramer's Rule Explained**:
   - In Cramer's Rule, each variable \( x_i \) in the system is solved by dividing the determinant of a modified matrix \( A_i \) by the determinant of the original coefficient matrix \( A \).
   - Matrix \( A_i \) is derived from matrix \( A \) by replacing its \( i^{th} \) column with the constant terms vector \( B \).

3. **Example Construction**:
   - For a given matrix \( A \):
     \[
     A = \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 & -3 \\
     2 & 2 & -1 \\
     1 & -1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The vector \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \begin{bmatrix} -5 \\ 4 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Matrix \( A_1 \) is constructed by replacing the first column of \( A \) with \( B \):
     \[
     A_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
     -5 & 2 & -3 \\
     4 & 2 & -1 \\
     6 & -1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Similarly, matrices \( A_2 \) and \( A_3 \) are constructed by replacing the second and third columns of \( A \) with \( B \), respectively.

4. **Determinant Calculation**:
   - The determinant of matrix \( A \) is calculated using cofactors.
   - For example, choosing row one for expansion, the determinant calculation involves:
     \[
     \text{det}(A) = 3 - 10 + 12 = 5
     \]
   - This process can be streamlined by recognizing patterns in cofactor signs (positive or negative).

5. **Efficiency Tip**:
   - The text suggests that with practice, one can perform these calculations mentally by remembering the pattern of positive and negative signs in the matrix of cofactors.

Overall, Cramer's Rule provides a systematic way to solve linear systems using determinants, emphasizing the importance of understanding cofactor expansion for efficient computation.

The text provides a brief explanation of using Cramer's Rule to solve a system of linear equations by calculating determinants. The speaker calculates the determinant of matrix \( A \) as 5 and uses it to find solutions for variables \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \). Specifically, they determine \( x_1 = 1 \) by dividing a modified determinant (also 5) by 5. For \( x_2 \), the speaker indicates that its solution involves calculating another determinant divided by 5 to get 4. They conclude by encouraging solving for all variables using this method, expressing gratitude at the end.
