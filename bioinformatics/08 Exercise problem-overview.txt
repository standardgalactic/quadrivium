The text provides an explanation on how to prove the associative property of set intersections using definitions and logical steps. The goal is to show that for any sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), the expression \( (A \cap B) \cap C \) is equal to \( A \cap (B \cap C) \).

The approach involves two main parts:

1. **Proving one direction:** Assume an element \( X \) belongs to \( (A \cap B) \cap C \). By the definition of intersection, this means \( X \in A \), \( X \in B \), and \( X \in C \). From these, it follows that \( X \in (B \cap C) \) and thus \( X \in A \cap (B \cap C) \). Therefore, \( (A \cap B) \cap C \subseteq A \cap (B \cap C) \).

2. **Proving the other direction:** Assume an element \( X \) belongs to \( A \cap (B \cap C) \). By definition, this means \( X \in A \) and \( X \in B \cap C \), which implies \( X \in B \) and \( X \in C \). Therefore, \( X \in A \cap B \) and since \( X \in C \), it follows that \( X \in (A \cap B) \cap C \). Thus, \( A \cap (B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cap C \).

Since both subsets have been proven, the sets are equal: \( (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C) \). This proof relies on understanding and applying the definitions of set intersection and equality.
