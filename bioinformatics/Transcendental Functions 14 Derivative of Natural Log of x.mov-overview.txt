The text explains how to find the derivative of the natural logarithm function using the fundamental theorem of calculus and the chain rule. Here's a summary:

1. **Derivative of Natural Logarithm**: The derivative of \(\ln(x)\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\). This result stems from applying the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus to the integral definition of the natural logarithm: \(\int_1^x \frac{1}{t} \, dt\).

2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: If \(F(x)\) is an antiderivative of a function \(f(x)\), then the derivative of the integral from 1 to \(x\) of \(f(t)\) with respect to \(t\) gives back \(f(x)\). In this context, \(\frac{d}{dx} \ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}\).

3. **Chain Rule Application**: For a function \(y = \ln(u)\), where \(u\) is a differentiable function of \(x\), the derivative with respect to \(x\) is found using the chain rule: \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{u} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}\).

4. **Example**: The derivative of \(\ln(2x)\) is calculated by setting \(u = 2x\). Using the chain rule, \(\frac{d}{dx} \ln(2x) = \frac{1}{2x} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{x}\), which illustrates that multiplying the argument of a natural log by a constant does not affect its derivative form.

The explanation emphasizes the conditions under which these rules apply, particularly noting that \(x\) must be greater than zero for the natural logarithm to be defined.
