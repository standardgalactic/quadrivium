The text introduces the concept of a product group in abstract algebra. A product group involves two arbitrary groups, \( H \) and \( K \), which can differ in size, elements, and operations. The set forming the product group is their Cartesian product: pairs consisting of one element from \( H \) and one from \( K \).

To define a group operation for this product group, we take two such pairs, say \((H_1, K_1)\) and \((H_2, K_2)\), and define the operation as \(((H_1, K_1) \cdot (H_2, K_2)) = (H_1 \circ H_2, K_1 \circ K_2)\). Here, \(\circ\) represents the respective group operations in \( H \) and \( K \).

The text then shows that this product group satisfies all group properties:

- **Closure**: Since both \( H \) and \( K \) are groups with their own closure properties, their product will also be closed under the defined operation.
- **Associativity**: The associativity of the product group follows directly from the associativity in each individual group \( H \) and \( K \).
- **Identity Element**: The identity element for the product group is simply the pair consisting of the identity elements of \( H \) and \( K \). This satisfies the identity property as each component behaves as expected.
- **Inverse Elements**: Each element in the product group has an inverse, formed by taking the inverses of its components from \( H \) and \( K \).

Thus, the Cartesian pair operation defined on \( H \times K \) ensures that the product group itself is a valid group. This concept highlights how two separate groups can be combined into a new group structure through their Cartesian product.

The text explains the concept of a product group in abstract algebra. A product group is formed from two arbitrary groups \( H \) and \( K \), which can have different sizes, elements, and operations. To construct this product group:

1. **Set Construction**: Use the Cartesian product to form pairs of elements, one from each group (\( (h, k) \) where \( h \in H \) and \( k \in K \)). This set forms the basis of the new group.

2. **Group Operation Definition**: Define a binary operation on this set by applying the group operations of \( H \) and \( K \) separately. For two elements \( (h_1, k_1) \) and \( (h_2, k_2) \), the product is defined as:
   \[
   (h_1, k_1) \cdot (h_2, k_2) = (h_1 \cdot_H h_2, k_1 \cdot_K k_2)
   \]
   where \( \cdot_H \) and \( \cdot_K \) are the operations in groups \( H \) and \( K \), respectively.

3. **Verification of Group Properties**:
   - **Closure**: The operation is closed because both components result from closed operations in their respective groups.
   - **Associativity**: Associativity holds as it follows directly from the associativity in \( H \) and \( K \).
   - **Identity Element**: The identity element of the product group is the pair consisting of the identity elements of \( H \) and \( K \), i.e., \( (e_H, e_K) \).
   - **Inverse Elements**: Each element \( (h, k) \) has an inverse \( (h^{-1}, k^{-1}) \) where \( h^{-1} \) and \( k^{-1} \) are the inverses in \( H \) and \( K \).

The product group is thus a new group formed by combining two groups through Cartesian pairing and component-wise operations, retaining all fundamental group properties.
