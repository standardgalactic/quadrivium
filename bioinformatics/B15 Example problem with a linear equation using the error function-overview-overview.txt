The text outlines solving an initial value problem for the first-order linear differential equation \( y' - 2xy = 2 \), with the initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \). The method involves using an integrating factor, which is calculated as \( e^{-x^2} \) from the coefficient of \( y \) in the original equation. Multiplying through by this integrating factor transforms the differential equation into:

\[ \frac{d}{dx}(e^{-x^2} y) = 2e^{-x^2}. \]

Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), we obtain:

\[ e^{-x^2} y = \int 2e^{-x^2} \, dx + C. \]

The integral of \( e^{-x^2} \) is expressed using the error function (\(\text{erf}\)). The solution becomes:

\[ y = 2e^{x^2} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt + Ce^{x^2}. \]

Using the initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \), we find \( C = 1 \). Therefore, the final solution is:

\[ y = e^{x^2} \left( 2 \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt + 1 \right). \]

This can be rewritten using properties of the error function as:

\[ y = \sqrt{\pi} \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + e^{x^2}. \]

The solution combines an exponential term and a term involving the error function.
