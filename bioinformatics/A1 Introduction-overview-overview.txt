Jean Club is an Acute Care Surgery specialist at Grootiskeer Hospital in Cape Town with a strong interest in the practical applications of differential equations. He believes that traditional textbooks make it difficult for beginners by presenting differential equations through complex real-world scenarios without sufficient mathematical groundwork. To overcome this challenge, Jean proposes a teaching strategy that begins with fundamental concepts and progresses to solving basic differential equation problems before addressing more intricate examples.

His plan includes topics like separable variable problems (the simplest type), linear equations, exact equations, substitution methods, and numerical methods for solving differential equations. This methodical approach aims to establish a solid foundation of understanding before moving on to more complex applications in the field.
