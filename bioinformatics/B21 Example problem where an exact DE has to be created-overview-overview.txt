The text outlines solving a non-linear first-order differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{xy}{20 - 2x^2 - 3y^2}\) using various techniques. Initially, the equation is recognized as difficult to separate variables or convert into a linear form with an integrating factor. It's then transformed into \(xy \, dx + (20 - 2x^2 - 3y^2) \, dy = 0\) to check for exactness, which it isn't.

To address this, the text identifies an appropriate integrating factor of \(y^3\), making the equation exact when multiplied through by it. The solution process involves:

1. Integrating with respect to \(x\) to find part of the potential function.
2. Differentiating and integrating with respect to \(y\) for another part.
3. Combining these results yields an implicit solution: \(\frac{1}{2} x^2 y^4 + \frac{1}{2} y^6 - 5y^4 = C\), where \(C\) is a constant.

This approach demonstrates using an integrating factor to transform and solve the differential equation by rendering it exact.
