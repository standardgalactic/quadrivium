The text discusses finding the magnetic field inside a current-carrying wire using Ampere's Law. It assumes that the current is uniformly distributed throughout the wire. By choosing a circular Amperian surface within the wire, it simplifies the calculation of the enclosed current (i_enclosed), which is proportional to the area ratio between the circle and the whole cross-sectional area of the wire.

The magnetic field \( B \) inside the wire is derived as:
\[ B = \frac{\mu_0 i r}{2\pi R^2} \]
where \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space, \( i \) is the total current, \( r \) is the radial distance from the center of the wire, and \( R \) is the radius of the wire.

The magnetic field increases linearly with \( r \) from zero at the center of the wire to a maximum at its surface. The concept of an Amperian surface (or empyrean surface in the text) is introduced as a loop used for applying Ampere's Law, emphasizing that it encloses current based on its placement relative to the currents within the wire.
