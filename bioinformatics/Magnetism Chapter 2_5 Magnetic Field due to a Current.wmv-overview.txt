The text discusses finding the magnetic field inside a current-carrying wire using Ampere's Law. It assumes that the current is uniformly distributed throughout the wire. By choosing a circular Amperian surface within the wire, it simplifies the calculation of the enclosed current (i_enclosed), which is proportional to the area ratio between the circle and the whole cross-sectional area of the wire.

The magnetic field \( B \) inside the wire is derived as:
\[ B = \frac{\mu_0 i r}{2\pi R^2} \]
where \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space, \( i \) is the total current, \( r \) is the radial distance from the center of the wire, and \( R \) is the radius of the wire.

The magnetic field increases linearly with \( r \) from zero at the center of the wire to a maximum at its surface. The concept of an Amperian surface (or empyrean surface in the text) is introduced as a loop used for applying Ampere's Law, emphasizing that it encloses current based on its placement relative to the currents within the wire.

The text discusses finding the magnetic field inside a long, straight wire carrying a uniform current. It uses Ampère's Law, expressed as \( \oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = \mu_0 i_{\text{enclosed}} \), to derive the expression for the magnetic field within the wire.

1. **Setup**: A circular path is considered inside the wire of radius \( r \). The symmetry allows simplification because the magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) has constant magnitude and direction tangent to the circle at every point.

2. **Ampère's Law Application**: 
   - The integral around the loop becomes \( B \cdot 2\pi r = \mu_0 i_{\text{enclosed}} \).
   - The enclosed current, \( i_{\text{enclosed}} \), is proportional to the area of the circle within radius \( r \) relative to the total cross-sectional area of the wire.
   - If the total radius of the wire is \( R \), then:
     \[
     i_{\text{enclosed}} = i \cdot \frac{\pi r^2}{\pi R^2} = i \cdot \left(\frac{r^2}{R^2}\right)
     \]

3. **Magnetic Field Derivation**:
   - Substituting \( i_{\text{enclosed}} \) into Ampère's Law gives:
     \[
     B \cdot 2\pi r = \mu_0 i \cdot \frac{r^2}{R^2}
     \]
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{\mu_0 i r}{2\pi R^2}
     \]

4. **Field Behavior**:
   - The magnetic field inside the wire increases linearly with distance from the center (\( r \)) and reaches a maximum at the surface of the wire (\( r = R \)).
   - Beyond this point, outside the wire, Ampère's Law would be used differently to find that \( B \) decreases inversely with distance.

5. **Enclosed Current Concept**:
   - The text also explains "enclosed current" using an "empyrean surface," a conceptual closed loop around currents.
   - Enclosed current depends on which currents lie inside the chosen path, affecting the right side of Ampère's Law.

In summary, the magnetic field within a uniformly charged wire increases linearly from the center to the edge and is derived using symmetry and Ampère's Law.
