The text discusses two optical problems involving lenses:

1. **Single Symmetric Mirror Problem:**
   - An object is placed in front of a symmetric mirror (either concave or convex), which has the same radius of curvature for both sides.
   - The image formed is inverted and reduced by a magnification factor of -0.25, indicating it's a real image since \( S_i \) is positive.
   - Given that the refractive index (\( N \)) is higher than the surrounding medium, this confirms the lens is converging (bi-convex).
   - Calculations show the object distance (\( S_0 = 20 \) cm) and image distance (\( S_i = 5 \) cm). The focal length (\( F \)) of the lens is determined to be 4.00 cm.
   - Using lens maker's formula, the radius of curvature (\( R \)) is found to be approximately 5.2 cm.

2. **Two-Lens System Problem:**
   - Two convex lenses are aligned on the same axis with focal lengths of 24 cm and 9 cm, respectively, separated by 10 cm.
   - An object is placed 6 cm from the first lens.
   - For the first lens:
     - The image formed (\( S_i \)) is virtual, upright, and located 8 cm on the same side as the object (calculated to be -8 cm).
   - Treating this virtual image as an object for the second lens:
     - It's located 18 cm from the second lens.
     - The resulting image is real, inverted, and positioned 18 cm from the second lens on the opposite side.

The problems illustrate how images are formed through lenses, using principles like magnification, focal length, and the lens makerâ€™s equation.
