The text discusses two optical problems involving lenses:

1. **Single Symmetric Mirror Problem:**
   - An object is placed in front of a symmetric mirror (either concave or convex), which has the same radius of curvature for both sides.
   - The image formed is inverted and reduced by a magnification factor of -0.25, indicating it's a real image since \( S_i \) is positive.
   - Given that the refractive index (\( N \)) is higher than the surrounding medium, this confirms the lens is converging (bi-convex).
   - Calculations show the object distance (\( S_0 = 20 \) cm) and image distance (\( S_i = 5 \) cm). The focal length (\( F \)) of the lens is determined to be 4.00 cm.
   - Using lens maker's formula, the radius of curvature (\( R \)) is found to be approximately 5.2 cm.

2. **Two-Lens System Problem:**
   - Two convex lenses are aligned on the same axis with focal lengths of 24 cm and 9 cm, respectively, separated by 10 cm.
   - An object is placed 6 cm from the first lens.
   - For the first lens:
     - The image formed (\( S_i \)) is virtual, upright, and located 8 cm on the same side as the object (calculated to be -8 cm).
   - Treating this virtual image as an object for the second lens:
     - It's located 18 cm from the second lens.
     - The resulting image is real, inverted, and positioned 18 cm from the second lens on the opposite side.

The problems illustrate how images are formed through lenses, using principles like magnification, focal length, and the lens maker’s equation.

The text describes a series of optical problems involving lenses and mirrors. Here’s a summary:

1. **Single Lens Problem:**
   - You have an object in front of a symmetric mirror (lens) with unknown curvature type but known magnification (-0.25), indicating the image is inverted and reduced.
   - Using lens formulas, it's determined that:
     - The lens is converging (bi-convex).
     - Object placement: beyond the focal point.
     - Calculations lead to a focal length of 4.00 cm.
     - Radius of curvature calculated as 5.2 cm.
     - Image characteristics: real, inverted, reduced.

2. **Two-Lens System Problem:**
   - Two convex lenses are aligned on the same axis with given focal lengths (24 cm and 9 cm) and specific separations.
   - Object is placed at a distance of 6 cm from the first lens, which is 10 cm away from the second lens.
   - First, treat the image formed by the first lens as an object for the second:
     - The first lens forms a virtual, upright image 8 cm on its side (magnification 1.33).
   - Second lens analysis using this virtual image:
     - Treats it as an object located 18 cm from the second lens.
     - Forms a real, inverted image 18 cm away from the second lens (same size as the intermediate image).

The problems illustrate how to determine image characteristics and placement for both single lenses and compound lens systems.
