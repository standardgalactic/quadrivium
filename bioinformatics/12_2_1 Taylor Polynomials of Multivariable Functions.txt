Anyway, and now we move on to the Taylor's expansion in multivariable functions.
So we now have to the power n. I'm going to start off by just giving the equation for this.
We have the Taylor expansion of whatever order for univariable calculus, single variable calculus.
We have an n here. It's the addition to putting r of this vector x.
It's going to be the sum of from k equals 0 to r of vector x minus vector p.
Now that won't be a single x value. p equals, say, pi over 4. It'll be a vector.
Dot product. And then we have Nabla the del operator.
And to the power r. So we'll have to learn how to do this.
Now, this is not multiplied by the f at p. There's something else that happens there.
Just keep in mind, once we start doing an example, it's not this multiplied by that.
I'll show you how that works over k factorial.
Let's just do k first order. Let's just do a first order.
I won't show you where, we won't prove where this comes from.
But let's just look at a first order.
So first of all, we'll have k equals 0.
If k equals 0, this is going to be to the power 0.
This is going to be to the power 0.
And I suppose we should actually put here k, shouldn't we?
From k equals 0 to r.
So k equals 0.
This is going to be a 0 in the denominator.
Anything to the power 0 is 1.
So we're just going to be left with the f at point p.
And then for k equals 1.
For k equals 1.
This is going to be 1.
So we're going to be left with the x minus p.
Point x minus vector x minus vector p.
Now it's going to be the dot product of the gradient of f at p.
Okay.
So, as I say, when we do something that is going to be more than just first order, you'll see what has to happen here.
So I just wanted to show you this thing, something very interesting is going to pop out from this.
We're not explaining why, but now the dot product comes there.
So it's vector x minus vector p dot product, the gradient of f at point p.
So if we put all of those together, we're going to notice that the Taylor expansion, the Taylor polynomial,
is going to equal, or that equals, which is almost f of x, I should say.
So that's an equal sign, f of p, vector p plus vector x minus vector p.
I'm trying to remember to put these underneath.
Dot product, the gradient of f at p.
Put them in a way up with the line.
Okay, and that should be very familiar to you.
This is the local linearization.
This is the local linearization of a function near a certain point.
A few chapters ago, we looked at this exclusively,
and then we also had to show that the limit as x approaches p of the f of x minus this,
which was just going to be the t of x because this is 1 divided by the norm of that vector has got to equal 0.
So if that was so, this turned out to be the local linearization.
And now you can see where this local linearization comes from.
And this is the first order Taylor polynomial at that spot.
As I said, imagine in two dimensions, my first polynomial might have been something like that.
And then near that point, this line, this first order Taylor polynomial would approximate the actual curve.
The higher order we go, the further away it will do that.
So important in this video, or the interesting fact in this video is just to see where local linearization actually comes from.
It's the first order Taylor polynomial for a multivariable function.
Now for interest sake, we've just looked at where the linear approximation equation comes from for multivariable functions.
And we saw how that flows from the first order Taylor polynomial from this equation.
Now let's use this example, we have the f of x and y, x and y, so it's two variables there.
e to the power x natural log of y, and we have the vector p, 0 comma 1.
Now let's build up to the second order Taylor polynomial of this.
So first of all, we're going to start at k equals 0, k equals 0.
What happens at k equals 0? The denominator is going to be 1.
All of this is to the power of 0, so that's a 1.
So all we're left with is the f of p, the f of vector p.
So I can substitute that in, that is going to be e to the power of 0, natural log of 1.
e to the power of 0 is just 1, natural log of 1 is 0, so we have 0.
Let's move on to the easy case of k equals 1.
Now with the local linearization, don't get too confused with that because what we did there,
we actually moved this out and it became, let's just remind ourselves of that.
That was the t of x equals the f of p, which is the part that is the 0 part, k equals 0.
And to that we were going to add x vector x minus vector p dot product, the gradient of f of p.
And that was supposed to be over 1 factorial, but we won't write that, that's just 1.
So you see very neatly this dot product moved out.
And if you do it longhand, you'll see why that happens.
But don't think that that is what happens when we carry on.
Don't automatically just jump the dot product there.
There's a reason how the dot product gets there.
And you'll see that especially when we move to k equals 2.
So don't let this be confusing.
Just use that as a point of interest so that you know where the equation for local linearization comes from.
Let's go for it.
k equals 1.
So we're going to have all of this to the power 1.
Let's have vector x.
What is vector x?
Vector x equals x, y.
And what is vector p?
Vector p equals 0, 1.
So what is vector x minus vector p?
That's very easy.
That is going to be x, y minus 1.
That is our new vector.
And that is to the power 1.
And we've got to get this dot product, the del operator.
Now we're dealing with 2.
We're dealing with 2 variables x and y.
So what is this del operator going to be?
Simply d1, d2.
So the partial derivative with respect to x and the partial derivative with respect to y.
So we've got to get that first.
That is going to be xd1 plus x times d1 plus y minus 1, d2.
That's a vector dot product, a vector.
So it's first component times first component plus second component times second component.
That's all.
Of the f at p.
At vector p.
Okay.
So we could do this if at vector p.
Now it's simple algebra.
I'll just multiply both of those out.
So we're going to have xd1 of the f at vector p plus y minus 1 second partial derivative of f at point p.
That is what we have.
Now please do not get confused.
This is a value x and a value y where this is the vector p and the vector p.
Don't get those confused because we are going to put in this equation now.
So don't get the two mixed up with each other.
Okay.
So let's first of all get the x.
What is the partial derivative?
Well that's by f, by x.
Of, let's just get it first, of the f of x.
And the f of x is e to the power x natural log of y.
What is that?
Well that is x times y treated as a constant.
That's with respect to x.
So that's this e to the power x.
E to the power x natural log of y.
It stays exactly the same.
But we don't want it in x and y.
We want it at vector p.
So we substitute the values in for vector p.
A 0 and a 1.
So we're going to get x e to the power 0 natural log of 1.
And that equals just 0.
That equals just 0.
What do we do on this side?
First of all let's just get this with respect to vector x.
So that has been plus y minus 1.
By f by y now.
Of e to the power x natural log of y.
So that is going to be y minus 1.
What is this?
Now x is a constant.
So we're going to have e to the power x over y.
E to the power x over y.
Because the first partial derivative of that would be 1 over y times e to the power x.
Which is now a constant.
X is seen as a constant.
But we don't want it in x and y.
We have to plug in the values at p.
Now this is the partial derivative of this function.
That has got nothing to do with this point.
We don't substitute y in there.
Just since we didn't substitute x in here.
We keep that as it is.
So that's going to be plus y minus 1.
E to the power x.
What is e to the power 0.
That's this 1 over y.
What is y is 1.
So we are left with 0 plus y minus 1 over 1.
So that equals just y minus 1.
So.
If we had to draw.
This.
Three dimensional shape.
And because we could say z equals.
Z equals e to the power x national level y.
If we had to get the local.
If this.
This would end up being the local linearization.
Y equals 1.
It is also known as the first order.
Taylor polynomial.
Of this multivariable function.
So all in all.
Up to this step.
It's not that difficult to do.
And we can actually also see here.
Why it was.
Why it happened that this product.
Uh.
Uh.
Came out.
Uh.
On that side.
As I said.
Don't.
Try not to get these two confused.
It didn't show you exactly how we got there.
But that shows.
The local linearization.
This are the steps to remember.
Because this is the kind of problem.
That you'll have to deal with.
Next we're going to go to second order.
And we'll see.
We'll have to go to higher order partial differentials.
And we remember fortunately.
We've done first.
Uh.
Higher order partial differentials.
So let's go to that.
And this problem.
So let's go to.
K equals 2.
So this is now going to be.
2.
So in the denominator.
We're also going to have 2.
2.
So far we had.
0 plus.
Y minus 1.
So we've got to remember.
That in front of all of this.
We now have a half.
That half comes from 2 factorial.
And the denominator.
We should not forget that.
We do remember.
That we still have.
This vector.
X comma.
Y minus 1.
And that we have to get.
With the dot product of.
D1.
D2.
But all of this.
Has to be squared.
Before we get that r.
The dip of p.
That vector p.
All of this is now squared.
Is now squared.
So how do we do that?
First we have to get the dot product.
Of these two vectors.
Remember our half.
In front.
So here we're going to have.
X D1.
Plus.
Y minus 1.
D2.
All of that.
Squared.
Before we get.
If p.
And this now.
Is simple algebra.
So.
Equals.
Equals.
Equals.
Don't forget.
Our half.
So what would this be?
Well that's.
X squared.
D1 squared.
Plus.
2 times.
X.
Y minus 1.
D1 squared.
Plus.
2 times.
X.
Y minus 1.
1.
D1.
D2.
Plus.
Y minus 1.
Squared.
So.
D2 squared.
All of that.
Before we take.
The f.
At p.
Now we're simply going to have this.
Multiplied.
Inside.
Of everyone.
So we're still going to be left with this.
Half on the outside.
We're going to have.
X squared.
D1.
Of.
D1.
I can write it twice.
D1 squared.
Of.
The f.
At p.
Plus.
2 times.
X.
Y minus 1.
D1.
Of.
D2.
Of.
The f.
At p.
Victor.
Plus.
Y.
Minus.
1.
Square.
D2.
Square.
Of.
The f.
At p.
As I say.
We have higher order partial differential equations now.
So just as we did with k equals 1.
We're going to get.
The first partial derivative of f.
At point p.
So first do it for x.
Then substitute your values in.
Remember that this.
X squared.
X.
Y minus 1.
Y minus 1 squared.
That has nothing to do with that point.
So this is going to remain x squared.
But first we're going to get the first partial derivative.
Of this.
We're going to have a new function.
Let's do that.
What is D1?
What is D1 of.
The f and x.
We already said.
That that stays the same.
Y is a constant.
So that's just going to be.
E to the power x natural log of y.
But there's another D1.
So I've got to do it again.
E to the power x natural log of y.
And fortunately of course it stays the same.
E to the power x natural log of y.
Now I can substitute.
I've still got this x squared in front.
And I can substitute values for that x and that y.
Here I would have gotten the second partial derivative first.
I would have gotten a new function.
Of that new function.
I now take the first partial derivative.
We've done that before many times.
I'll have my second function.
Into which I substitute the zero and one.
And I add this in front.
Eventually multiplying by a half.
A half.
A half.
A half.
A half.
A half.
