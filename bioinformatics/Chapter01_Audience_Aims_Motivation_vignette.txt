Welcome to this first lecture on conducting your own research.
What are you going to get?
First of all, a set of video lectures just like this one.
But you're also going to get a set of documents.
Now these you can read on your tablet, on your computer screen,
or you can even print them out and you'll have a nice little textbook.
They actually reflect the computer files that we're going to work with
and those you'll get too, together with the raw data files we're going to work with.
So what happens in lecture one?
Just read chapter one of the documentation.
It really just is about the aims that we have for this course,
who I think the audience is and I really want to motivate for why I think this course is so important.
Read through that first chapter and I'll see you in the next lecture.
