The text emphasizes the critical need for managing diabetic patients effectively in a surgical setting due to their heightened risk of complications and mortality. It defines normal glucose levels (60-90 mg/dL) and explains that fasting blood glucose levels between 100-125 mg/dL suggest pre-diabetes, while those above 125 mg/dL indicate diabetes. Pre-diabetics may develop glucose intolerance due to factors like medication or stress. The two main types of diabetes are highlighted: Type 1, characterized by insufficient insulin production, and Type 2, marked by insulin resistance.

The text notes that a significant portion of the population, especially in America, might be diabetic or pre-diabetic, often without awareness. It advises healthcare providers not to create new diabetic care protocols from scratch but rather to utilize existing evidence-based ones. Collaboration among medical and anesthetic colleagues is recommended to ensure proper care for diabetic patients undergoing surgery.
