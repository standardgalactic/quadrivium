The text outlines guidelines for evaluating post-operative mortality and mobility risk, emphasizing the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system. It stresses understanding pre-operative cardiac risks, often related to supply-demand issues rather than thrombotic states. Key points include:

- **ASA Scoring**: Ranges from ASA1 (healthy patient) to ASA5 (patient not expected to survive 24 hours without surgery), with an additional suffix for emergency procedures.
  
- **Pre-operative Cardiac Risk**: Affects up to one-third of surgical patients, influenced by the type and location of surgery. High-risk areas include surgeries involving major fluid shifts or thoracic and abdominal regions.

- **Risk Assessment Tools**: Outdated tools like Goldman's are rarely used; instead, Eagles and Lee systems are preferred for cardiac risk stratification.

- **History and Examination**: Important elements involve patient age, history of myocardial infarction (particularly recent occurrences), hypertension control, physical exams, and ECGs. Echoing is recommended for patients with significant cardiovascular issues or recent events.

The text advocates a comprehensive pre-operative assessment approach using clinical evaluations and stratification systems to effectively predict and manage post-operative risks.
