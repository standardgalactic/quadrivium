The text explains how to calculate the curvature (\(\kappa\)) of a curve defined by parametric equations in two dimensions using derivatives and vector calculus. It begins with a function \(f(x)\) parameterized by \(t\) such that \(x = t\) and \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, f(t), 0)\).

To find the curvature:
1. Compute the first derivative: \(\mathbf{r}'(t) = (1, f'(t), 0)\).
2. Compute the second derivative: \(\mathbf{r}''(t) = (0, f''(t), 0)\).

The curvature is determined using the formula:
\[
\kappa = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)}{|\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3}
\]

The cross product of \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) and \(\mathbf{r}''(t)\) results in the vector \((0, 0, f''(t))\), focusing only on its \(k\) component. The magnitude of \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) is \(\sqrt{1 + [f'(t)]^2}\).

Thus, the curvature simplifies to:
\[
\kappa = \frac{f''(t)}{(1 + [f'(t)]^2)^{3/2}}
\]

This formula provides a method for calculating curvature in two-dimensional space, with references to other methods that might be used depending on context.
