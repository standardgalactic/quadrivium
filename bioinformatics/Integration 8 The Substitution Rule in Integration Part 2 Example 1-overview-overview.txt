To find the indefinite integral of \(\sqrt{5x - 1}\) with respect to \(x\), we use the method of substitution. Here's a concise summary of the steps:

1. **Substitution**: 
   - Set \(u = 5x - 1\). Then, \(du = 5 \, dx\) or \(dx = \frac{1}{5} \, du\).

2. **Rewrite the Integral**:
   - The original integral \(\int \sqrt{5x - 1} \, dx\) becomes \(\int \sqrt{u} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \, du\).

3. **Integrate**:
   - Simplify to \(\frac{1}{5} \int u^{1/2} \, du\).
   - Use the power rule for integration: \(\int u^{n} \, du = \frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\).
   - For \(n = 1/2\), this gives \(\int u^{1/2} \, du = \frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2} + C = \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} + C\).

4. **Substitute Back**:
   - Replace \(u\) with \(5x - 1\): 
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3} (5x - 1)^{3/2} + C = \frac{2}{15} (5x - 1)^{3/2} + C
   \]

The indefinite integral of \(\sqrt{5x - 1}\) with respect to \(x\) is:
\[
\frac{2}{15} (5x - 1)^{3/2} + C
\] 

This example illustrates how substitution can simplify the integration process by identifying a function and its derivative within the integrand.
