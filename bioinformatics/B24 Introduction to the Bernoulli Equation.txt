The second type of equation that we want to do substitution on is this Bernoulli's equation and you should recognize it there. It might seem somewhat familiar. You might say, well, what if n equals 0?
Well, then we're simply going to have y prime plus p of x, y equals y to the power of 0. It's just 1f of x. And we have a linear equation. We have a linear equation. So we know now n cannot be 0. What about if n equals 1?
Well, we're going to have y prime plus the p of x, y equals another function of x times y. I can bring this over to this side. I'm going to have y prime plus the p of x, y minus the f of x, y.
I can take out y as a common factor. And that should be positive. It would be p of x minus the f of x equals 0. And I can just call this a new function. Let's call it q of x.
It's just the subtraction of two polynomial functions here, or two functions in x. So that's y prime plus q of x, y equals 0. And that is another linear equation.
It would just be homogeneous because we just set it equal to 0. f of x is 0. So n, not m, n is also not equal to 1.
It would be another constraint there. So if n does not equal to 0 and n does not equal to 1, this is called Bernoulli's equation.
With those two allowed, as far as this counting number n is concerned, we'll end up with two linear equations.
Now we're going to use substitution on this. And you'll remember that the substitution we're going to use, substitution that we are going to use is y equals u to the power 1 minus n.
So put that one down for storage in the memory banks as well.
