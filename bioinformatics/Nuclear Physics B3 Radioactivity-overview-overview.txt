The text provides an overview of radioactivity and its early study through experiments with magnetic fields and photographic plates. It identifies three types of radiation: alpha rays (positively charged helium nuclei stopped by thin lead), beta rays (negatively charged particles requiring thicker lead), and gamma rays (uncharged, needing denser materials like lead for absorption). These discoveries led to the establishment of new conservation laws in physics.

Radioactive decay involves transformations that change one element into another. Alpha decay results in a decrease in atomic number by 2 and mass number by 4 when an alpha particle is emitted; for example, Uranium-238 becomes Thorium-234. Beta-negative decay occurs when a neutron converts to a proton, emitting a beta particle (electron) and increasing the atomic number by one, as seen when thorium-234 transforms into protactinium-234.

The text also describes two other nuclear processes: electron capture and beta-positive decay. In electron capture, an inner shell electron is absorbed by the nucleus, converting a proton to a neutron, while in beta-positive decay, a proton changes into a neutron, releasing a positron and reducing the atomic number by one. Both processes are examples of nuclear transmutation, illustrating transformations between different elements governed by conservation laws.
