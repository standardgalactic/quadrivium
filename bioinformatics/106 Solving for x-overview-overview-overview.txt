To solve systems of equations using SymPy in Python, follow these steps:

1. **Import SymPy and Define Symbols:**
   Import the necessary modules and define symbols for variables.
   ```python
   from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

   x, y = symbols('x y')
   ```

2. **Define Equations with Zero on One Side:**
   Structure each equation to have all terms on one side (typically zero).
   ```python
   eq1 = Eq(x + y - 1, 0)
   eq2 = Eq(x - y - 1, 0)
   ```

3. **Solve the System:**
   Use `solve` with a tuple of equations and symbols.
   ```python
   solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
   print(solution)  # Output: {x: 1, y: 0}
   ```

For more complex systems:

1. **Define Additional Symbols:**
   Include any extra symbols needed.
   ```python
   z = symbols('z')
   ```

2. **Set Up Complex Equations:**
   Ensure all equations are set to zero.
   ```python
   eq3 = Eq(3*x + 2*y + z - 10, 0)
   eq4 = Eq(x + 2*y + 4*z - 12, 0)
   eq5 = Eq(2*x + 2*y + z - 8, 0)
   ```

3. **Solve the Complex System:**
   Use `solve` with the list of equations and symbols.
   ```python
   solution_complex = solve((eq3, eq4, eq5), (x, y, z))
   print(solution_complex)  # Output: {x: 2, y: 1, z: 2}
   ```

**Key Points:**
- Use `Eq(lhs, rhs)` format with `rhs` as zero.
- Pass tuples of equations and symbols to `solve`.
- SymPy handles multiple variables efficiently, making it ideal for both educational and practical uses.
