In the previous lecture, it was explained how the area under a curve connects to probability or p-values, particularly when comparing means across different groups. Graphs generated by computers for such analyses include both z-distributions and t-distributions. The z-distribution is used when the population standard deviation is known; however, since this information is often unavailable in practice, the t-distribution is commonly employed instead.
