The script demonstrates how to use Plotly's `create_distplot` function for visualizing the salary distributions of female and male employees. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown:

1. **Setup Data**: 
   - Prepare lists (`hist_data`) with salary values from separate sub-dataframes for females and males.
   - Define `group_labels` to label these datasets.

2. **Create Basic Distribution Plot**:
   - Generate histograms, rug plots, and kernel density estimates (KDEs) using `create_distplot`.

3. **Customize Colors**:
   - Use RGB values to assign distinct colors for male and female distributions.
   - Adjust opacity for better visibility of overlapping areas.

4. **Change Curve Type**:
   - Switch the curve type from KDE to a normal distribution by setting `'normal'` in `curve_type`.

5. **Modify Layout**:
   - Customize the plot layout with titles and axis properties using `fig.update_layout`.
   - Optionally, hide elements like histograms or rug plots.

6. **Axis Customization**:
   - Focus on specific salary ranges by adjusting the x-axis domain (e.g., $1,000 to $5,000).

This tutorial showcases Plotly's flexibility in creating and customizing distribution plots for effective dataset comparison.
