The text discusses the concept of finding the inverse of a matrix, drawing parallels to division in algebra. Just as any nonzero real number can be divided by itself to yield one, a matrix \(A\) can have an inverse such that when multiplied with \(A\), it results in the identity matrix \(I\). However, unlike numbers, not all matrices have inverses. A necessary condition for a matrix to have an inverse is that it must be square (same number of rows and columns) and non-singular (having a nonzero determinant).

For 2x2 matrices, finding the inverse involves calculating the determinant, given by \(AD - BC\). If this determinant is zero, the matrix is singular and does not have an inverse. For invertible 2x2 matrices, the inverse can be computed using the formula: 

\[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} 
\begin{bmatrix}
D & -B \\
-C & A
\end{bmatrix} \]

An example is provided with a 2x2 matrix \(A\) having elements \([3, 1; 4, 2]\). The determinant is calculated as \(6 - 4 = 2\), and the inverse of \(A\) is found to be:

\[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -1 \\
-4 & 3
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -0.5 \\
-2 & 1.5
\end{bmatrix} \]

This process illustrates how matrix inversion is performed for simple cases, noting that it becomes more complex with larger matrices.
