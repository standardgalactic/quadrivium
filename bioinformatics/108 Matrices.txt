In this video lecture let's have a look at matrix algebra in SymPy. As per usual I'm
going to import SymPy and I'm going to use the abbreviation SYM and I'm going to invoke
pretty printing by stating SYM dot INIT underscore printing open and close parentheses and we'll
execute that code. SymPy is now loaded into this notebook and I can refer to everything
contained within SymPy by just referring to it via its abbreviation SYM. So I'm going to print to the
screen this string the matrix A and we're going to define the matrix. Simply going to attach this
matrix to a variable. So I'm going to design this matrix and attach it to the variable so this
variable in computer memory now contains this matrix and then I'm just going to print that variable in
other words the matrix. So how do you do that? It's SYM dot capital M uppercase M matrix and I have my
open and close parentheses and now I'm just going to take the elements of that matrix. Now watch very
carefully with the open and close parentheses there's also an open and close square brackets so the whole
thing has to be enclosed in open and close parentheses and open and close square brackets and then every
row is within another set of square brackets and every row all the elements in that row are
I should say and then every row is separated by a comma by a comma. So it's a comma and then the
second row there. You will note that each row here has two columns so I'm going to have as elements in
my first row column one is one column two is two and I say remember the floating dot I want these to be
floating point values not integers otherwise you're going to do equations on you're going to multiply
matrices for instance and the answers are not going to come out correct or especially if we do the
inverse if these are not floating point values. They might but just make sure to be 100% sure put those
dots you don't have to put the zero. So I'm going to have one and two and here I'm going to have negative
a half which I've done as negative one divided by two enclosed it in in parentheses and then one
and then I'm going to then I'm going to print a let's see how that works and there it is a thing of
beauty one two negative a half and one and there is my matrix a beautiful. Now I'm not going to show
you how to do a second matrix and how to do matrix additions you should know about matrix algebra
they should be the same size if you want to do addition and subtraction very easy to do
to store them as variables a and another one b and just say a plus b no issue you can sort these
things out for yourself very easy to do let's do something a bit more interesting eigenvalues so the
eigenvalues of matrix matrix a very simple sym dot matrix a so I you I had this variable and I called it
variable a so I can just refer to a there if I didn't do that I could have just typed out the
whole thing here sym dot uppercase matrix open close parentheses open close square brackets and
entered the whole thing there but I have attached it to this variable a so I can just use it
dot eigenvalues vals open close parentheses off we go and this eigen the eigenvalues of matrix a
is there's one eigenvalue of one negative i and one eigenvalue of one plus i so if there were more
than one of these it'll be two three whatever it's so easy to get the eigenvalues and it's just as easy
to get the eigenvectors it's sym dot matrix a dot eigenvectors and there you go so what it will do
it will say for the eigenvalue one minus i there's one eigenvector and it's two i and one
for the eigenvalue one plus one i there's one eigenvector negative two i and one very easy very
beautiful to do now some pi it's symbolic remember it can do things that are even more fantastic
i can have symbols in my matrix so first of all look at this b11 b12 b13 b21 b22 and i am saying
that this is a variable and i latch it on to this symbol and that looks ugly but you'll see in a bit
so as equals sym dot symbols as we did with x y theta etc i'm going to introduce this variable b
and i'm going to attach to that this matrix which has one two three three two one rows each with one
two three columns and i'm referring to those symbols i'm going to print the string the matrix b
colon and then actually print that and voila look at that isn't that fantastic i mean it really looks
good you can't deny that it's putting the the sub values there so b sub one one referring to row one
column one there we have row one column two row one column three and that's beautiful let's declare
more symbols c1 c2 and c3 as symbols c1 c2 c3 and now this is going to be a column matrix because there's
these commas in between the rows and each row only contains one column let's see let's see if that is
so indeed a column matrix so b is a three by three matrix c is a three by one matrix i can multiply it
in that order b times c very easy to do that's why i'm not even showing you addition and subtraction
if the matrices are of equal size you can add and subtract them let's look at multiplication remember
i can't have c times b that would be impossible it's a three by one matrix times a three by three
matrix times the three by one matrix the result should be a three by one matrix let's have a look
so i can simply refer to the variables b and c and let's run that code and look at that so it's taken
these symbols with the subscripts and it's done most in the most beautiful fashion showing you
there's my first row my second row my third row indeed a three by one matrix as we thought it would
be beautiful to do look at this one we have matrix f so again i've just used f let's print that
and it's a two by two matrix and how to get the determinant so instead of values i could have put
values in here as well so as we did with matrix a let's we have the determinant so you just refer to
it as f dot det open and close parentheses and it will actually show you how the determinant of a
two by two matrix is done it's f sub one one times f sub two two minus the product of f sub one two and
f sub two one and if i put in values there it would have actually given me the answer same with the
inverse of a matrix so it can be done symbolically or with actual constant values so again it will just
be f dot i and v open and close parentheses and off we go and show you actually how to do how to do
the inverse of a two by two matrix and it needn't be two by two i can use a much bigger one even this
try stating b dot i and v open and close parentheses it actually goes off screen it's so large but it'll
show you symbolically then how to do this as i said you can also put values in there it's really just a
pleasure to work with matrices in some pie
