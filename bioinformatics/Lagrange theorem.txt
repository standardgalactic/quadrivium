So let's finally see where this is going.
Co-sets lead us to Lagrange's Theorem.
And if this is the first video that you see, you're not going to understand much,
start with the first one. I'll link to it down below.
I'll put it up in the corner there to start with the video on co-sets.
Before we get to Lagrange's Theorem, let's just consider partitioning.
Partitioning of sets.
Yes, remember if I have this finite set and I can, it's almost like a Venn diagram,
partitioning means I can subdivide it into subsets such as if this was a set S
and this was my subset S1 and make it SI and SJ, etc.
that if I take the intersection between these, those are always the empty set, they are disjoint.
So if I can divide a set into these disjoint subsets, I have partitioned that whole set.
So just remember partitioning.
And what we are suggesting here with Lagrange's Theorem,
so let's just say Lagrange's Theorem, Lagrange, Lagrange's Theorem,
is that we can take the set that makes up a group
and we can partition it into a subgroup.
So let's imagine that's the whole group.
I'm going to suggest that we can have this, if that's the whole group G,
the set that makes up the group G under some binary operation.
I can partition it into a subgroup and all the cosets and all its cosets.
Now it's going to be either all its left cosets or all its right cosets.
Remember the two situations where we have when the left and right cosets are equal.
There's videos for that.
Remember that would be when we have a normal subgroup
and when we have an abelian, when obviously we have an abelian group
where we can do when the commutivity applies.
So Lagrange's Theorem, that's not what the Lagrange's Theorem says,
but what we are claiming here is that we can partition the set that makes up a group.
Now let's just consider just the left ones for the moment.
I'm going to have AH and that is going to be all these.
Remember, such as H is an element of H.
That's my left coset.
Now imagine we're just going to, we've seen what happens when A is an element of H,
but now let's just consider A is not an element of H.
So A is going to be not an element of H
and we've shown that then it's not, you know, if it's not, then it's not going to be there.
So I have all these left cosets there.
And I'm suggesting that there's another element B
and that it's, if I have an element B,
then it's not going to be an element of this coset.
There is going to be this element.
Now, if that is so, just think about it logically,
that means that I have these two cosets
and their intersection is going to equal the empty set.
They're going to be disjoint.
So I'm stating that there's going to be this other,
this other element B to make another coset
and that these cosets are disjoint.
That means I'm going to have this specific thing here.
And if I can show that to be true,
if I can show that there's an element B that's not in,
you know, it's not one of these.
Remember, this is going to be one element.
B might be one of the elements.
I might have A, O, H, A, not O, it's binary operation with H being B.
But imagine then B equals B is not in there.
I can find a B that's not in there.
It means that I'm going to be able to create another subset,
another coset,
and that coset is completely disjoint from this coset.
So how can we prove that?
We can prove that by suggesting that
this empty, this empty,
this is not an empty set.
That the intersection is not empty.
That there is some overlap there.
And if there's some overlap,
that would mean, you know,
I'm suggesting here that B is an element.
B is an element of this left coset.
That there is such an element.
And if that is so, you know,
then this is not the empty set.
In other words,
if I take this left coset, B,
it's going to equal one of these that are in there.
But I've got to make it some other H
so that I'm not simply just sticking to one of the H's.
Remember if we had Cayley's,
if we had Cayley's table,
and H means I've got to cycle through all of the H's.
Not cycle through,
but it's A times the first H,
A times then by times I mean binary operation,
the second H, the third H, the fourth H, whatever.
And I don't want these to be exactly equal.
I want to be totally arbitrary about this.
Now, if this is so,
I'm stating now to the contrary
that this is not the empty set.
So I can find this B that's an element of A, H.
And that means B is going to equal to H inverse.
If I take H inverse on both sides,
by associativity, I can do these two.
But remember this and this,
they are both elements of H.
So what I've just written here,
this is an element of H.
So what I've written here as B is,
by contrast,
you know, I said that it's not.
It is an element of H.
And we said that it's not an element of H.
So what we've shown here is by contradiction
that there will be this B
with forming a left coset
that will be quite distinct from,
will have a non-empty set,
will be disjoint from this coset.
And so on and so on and so on.
I can find another one, C, arbitrarily,
to show that it would be disjoint from this one,
which is disjoint from this one.
In other words, I'm going to find
this very specific partitioning
of the set G that makes up the group G
by the subgroup H
and by all the cosets.
It's easy to prove by contradiction here.
Now think about this, though, for a moment now.
We know that if the cardinality
or how many elements there are in the subgroup H,
that is going to equal
how many, and we saw that
because, remember, if we had this coset,
it'll have exactly the same number of elements.
We've proven that.
It'll have the same as that.
And I've just shown that these must,
there are some distinct ones.
They are totally disjoint,
but they must all have,
they must have, all have,
I'm going to call them AI,
they must all have the same cardinality.
And if they are disjoint,
and I add all of them up,
imagine that they are, you know,
H with all of these,
imagine that there are M of them.
There are M,
or let's just imagine that the cardinality
or the number of elements in there is M.
So there's got to be M times N of these,
where N is how many there are.
1, 2, 3, N is an element,
N and M actually is an element
of the natural numbers.
So imagine this one was 5,
then that one must be 5,
and that one must be 5,
that one must be 5,
that one must be 5.
So it's just so many multiples,
N multiples of 5.
And that brings us to Lagrange's theorem
only for finite sets.
We can't do this for infinite sets.
For finite sets is that
the number of elements,
I've just made up the whole of G,
that must be some multiple of,
the cardinality of the set
of the subgroup,
the set that makes up the subgroup.
A better way to write this
is that this divides G,
the cardinality of G.
Okay, it must divide.
So if I have,
if I have that H,
if I have that,
say for instance,
G is 7,
you know, this is a lovely thing.
So say for instance,
G is 8,
I cannot make up a subgroup H
that has 3,
that has 3 elements in it.
There's so many subgroups
I can immediately throw out.
Of course,
the subgroup must have
the identity element,
there's all of,
you know,
all everything,
all the properties of groups
must be there,
but there's an easier way
to get rid of possible subgroups
is if the cardinality
of that subgroup
does not divide
the cardinality
of the group
from which it is taken,
then it's gone.
And it's so clear
and easy to see
if just from
this logical argument,
this is just,
just a simple fact.
So I can really take out
many of these.
Another beautiful,
so Lagrange's theorem
is very powerful,
it's very powerful
for us in that way.
And another thing,
think about this
is what if
G is,
the cardinality of G
is a prime number.
Now we've just seen,
so the only thing,
the only thing
that can happen here
is it must be
either equal to,
H must equal G
or H must just have
a single element
and that is
the G's
identity element.
So those are
the two trivial subgroups
of G
and that's also
quite nice,
a nice thing
to immediately see.
So if,
if,
if,
if there are
prime number of elements
inside of the set
that makes up the group,
then I can,
then I can only have
the two trivial subgroups.
The two trivial subgroups.
And there's one more
beautiful thing
that comes from this
and that is the,
the real power
behind this,
the real power
and it's an isomorphism.
If I take X
an element of G
and I make up
the cyclic group
of G,
I make up a cyclic group
with an element of G
and I let G,
the cardinality of G
be a prime number.
So,
that is going to equal
X to the power 0
that is just the identity
element of G
and then X
just
itself
then X
binary operation X
then X
binary operation X
binary operation X
etc.
And
it means I've got to
stop some way
because
I,
it can only have
this subset
can only have
this cyclic subgroup
that I'm making,
the cyclic subgroup
that I'm making,
can only have
either
because this one
has a prime number
of elements
that means
this cyclic
cyclic
subgroup
can only have
either the one
and it's only this one
or
it must have
the same elements
of this.
So,
if that's a prime number
and let's make
that prime number P
it means I can only
go up to
X
P minus 1
I can only go up
to X
P minus 1
because together
with this one
it will give me
P elements
and if I go to
X to the power P
that will
automatically be
X to the power 0
again
and that means
the cyclic
the cyclic
or
or
or
groups with
prime number
elements in them
they are
isomorphic
and if that prime
number says P
that is isomorphic
to the cyclic group
with
that number
of elements
and that's a very easy
group to understand
the cyclic
group
very easy to
understand group
and with finite
number of elements
and that is
isomorphic
to
this group
these set of groups
with prime
numbered
elements inside
of them
and that means
it's very easy
to understand
all of them
because they are
isomorphic
to
the cyclic
group
with a prime
number
of elements. So all in all we've combined everything that
we've learned. Start with the first video on cosets. You won't just understand what's going on here
but see how logically we can just let our minds flow and all this
flows logically from there which gives us this very nice
idea here, Lagrange's theorem
just to remember it like this and which gives us this isomorphism
with a cyclic group with prime elements if we just consider groups with a
prime number of elements. The set that makes up the group have prime number of elements.
Fantastic stuff, you've got to agree.
