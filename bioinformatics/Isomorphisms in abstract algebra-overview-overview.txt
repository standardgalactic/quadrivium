The text explains the concept of an isomorphism between two groups using colored chalk as a visual tool. An isomorphism is defined as a bijective homomorphism that preserves group operations, meaning it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

Two specific sets are examined: \( G \), which consists of integers modulo 4 under addition, and \( H \), consisting of non-zero integers modulo 5 under multiplication. The mapping between these groups is defined as follows:
- In \( G \): 0 maps to 1, 1 maps to 3, 2 maps to 4, and 3 maps to 2.

This mapping is confirmed to be both injective and surjective by ensuring each element in one set uniquely corresponds to an element in the other. To verify the isomorphism, Cayley tables are constructed for both groups: addition modulo 4 for \( G \) and multiplication modulo 5 for \( H \). The verification process involves checking that operations within each group correspond accurately under this mapping.

An essential observation highlighted is the unique appearance of each element once in every row and column of group tables, a characteristic feature of finite groups. This property prevents repetition and supports proofs like Cayley's theorem, which states every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group.

The text underscores the importance of understanding this structure for deeper insights into group theory and constructing proofs such as Cayleyâ€™s theorem. Recognizing patterns in group operations aids in building group tables and verifying group properties.
