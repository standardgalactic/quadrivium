The text provides a guide on using SymPy, a symbolic mathematics library in Python, to calculate mathematical limits. It starts by showing how to import SymPy as `SYM` and define variables as symbols. The primary focus is the `limit` function, which computes limits of functions. For example, it calculates the limit of sin(X)/X as X approaches zero, resulting in 1.

The text also covers using infinity in SymPy, represented by double lowercase 'oo' (e.g., `SYM.oo`). It demonstrates evaluating limits at infinity, such as finding that the limit of 1/X as X approaches infinity is 0.

Additionally, it discusses one-sided limits, where the `dir` argument specifies approaching from the positive or negative direction. Examples include reaching zero from either side to get positive or negative infinity, respectively.

Lastly, the text touches on handling negative infinity in expressions and notes considerations for executing code efficiently within Python, specifically mentioning compatibility with Python 2.7.6 for certain syntax requirements.
