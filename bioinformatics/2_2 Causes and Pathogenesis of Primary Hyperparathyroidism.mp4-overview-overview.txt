The video provides an overview of primary hyperparathyroidism, emphasizing its causes and pathogenesis. It explains that since 1974, when routine blood calcium measurement began, there has been a shift in how hyperparathyroidism is detectedâ€”from overt symptoms to subclinical cases identified through elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.

The discussion highlights the role of PTH in regulating ionized calcium, crucial for metabolic processes. Decreases in ionized calcium trigger PTH release from the parathyroid glands, which then increases calcium levels via bone resorption, enhanced kidney activation of vitamin D3, and greater calcium absorption in the gut.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a single adenoma in one of the parathyroid glands (90%), followed by double adenomas (5%) and glandular hyperplasia involving all four glands (about 5%). Parathyroid carcinoma, though rare, can also cause increased PTH levels.

The condition is more prevalent among females and individuals over 45. It may be associated with familial syndromes like MEN1 and MEN2, as well as isolated hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, thiazide diuretics can unmask mild hypercalcemia in those with underlying primary hyperparathyroidism.
