so here we are in lecture 3 and we're going to do at the math module that is something that you
import into Python which allows you to do various mathematical calculations let's have a look so
here we are back in the shell and you'll remember from the previous lecture I can do simple
arithmetic something we perhaps didn't talk about I can also force the issue by saying 3 plus 4 let's
make it 4 times 2 space 2 and there you go we're going to force the addition before we get to the
multiplication just by putting in some parentheses but what if I want to do something a bit more
interesting than this what if I wanted to know what 3 factorial is how would I go about doing that
now if you're just running Python as is you're not going to be able to do these things you have to
import the mathematics module and it's very simple to do I can just say import and the word math and
there we go the mathematics module is now loaded into this running instance of Python now look very
carefully it says import math so there's a lot of stuff I can do with math but I have to call
that math module up before I do something what I mean by that is if I want to have the value pi I'll
have to say math dot pi and there we have it if I want to say want the value of e well as number there
I have to say math dot e so I have to bring that math in every time so what can we do let's have a
quick look we can say math dot factorial that would be one thing to do and as soon as I open my
parentheses it'll give me it will give me an explanation of kind of like trying to do that
not that that tip is very helpful but let's say factorial 3 we know that that should be 6 and lo and
behold we have 6 now let's see if we can if we can do some some other functions what if we wanted
to know math dot e to the power 4 so that's exponent the exp and the value 4 and that's going to be
Euler's number to the power 4 and we see there it's 54 just to have a make sure if we put exp 1
that should just give us Euler's number and indeed it does 2.718818 etc what about other transcendental
calculations like math dot log so when I write log I just have to know that it's going to if I just put
a value in it is going to give me so let's say math dot e so I can't just refer to E just to show you
that it's going to be 1 because just the log just log there refers to the natural log okay so if you
write out log like this it means natural log I can say math dot log and I can say 1000 comma and then I can
say 10 and that's going to give me now I've got to be very careful here the way that math this math module
in Python interprets things it is going to have these round of round off situations because clearly
the answer should just be 3 and clearly it's trying to get to 3 there so you just have to be aware of the
the way that things do do work in Python I can say math dot log 10 that's another function that is up
and if I put a thousand there now it's going to give me 3 so notice the slight little difference there
something a bit more mundane let's go for math dot power so I'm going to have 3 comma 4 so that is
3 to the power of 4 and indeed that is 81 what about square root math dot square root of
81 and that is 9 indeed what about sine and cosine what is the math dot sine of math dot pi well we know
that the math that the sine of pi should be 0 and we see there it is okama 15 zeros 1 so clearly it is
trying to get 2 but it's really the way that these floating point values work it is using it is using pi
to a certain precision and it's taking that value and getting the sine of that and that's why you're
not going to get this clear cut zero here okay it is there is some round off issues going going on here
now I can also say math dot radians what is going to happen there math dot radians I've got to put an x
value in there and if I do that it's going to convert my degrees to radians so I've put in 180
and there we go almost the value of pi there if I say math dot degrees it's going to take my degrees
and convert it to oh it's going to take radians and convert it to two degrees so let's say math dot pi
so there we have it is 180 degrees so it's going to convert two degrees and it's going to convert
two radians there so that is in in essence uh the math module that you can load there's all sorts of
uh other functions you can do you can do the error function at a value x you can do the gamma function
at a value x etc so there are a few other things to do but in essence now you know that you can do these
extra mathematical calculations and you know that you have to import it with this statement import math
and then you have to refer to these various functions inside of the math module so you have to say math dot
