Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complex systemic condition characterized by simultaneous thrombosis (clot formation) and hemorrhage (bleeding). It results from exposure to pro-coagulant factors such as tissue factor or cancer pro-coagulants, leading to widespread fibrin formation, its breakdown, depletion of clotting factors, bleeding, and potential organ damage.

### Key Points:

- **Pathogenesis**: DIC involves uncontrolled thrombin production causing intravascular fibrin deposition. Normally controlled by antithrombin and tissue factor pathway inhibitors, these mechanisms are overwhelmed in DIC.
  
- **Etiology**: Massive activation of the coagulation cascade can occur due to tissue thromboplastins release, vascular endothelium injury, or expression of tissue factors induced by endotoxins and cytokines. Fibrin degradation products interfere with normal clotting.

### Forms:

1. **Chronic Compensated DIC**: Liver and bone marrow compensation results mainly in thrombotic conditions, like Trousseau's syndrome in malignancies.
2. **Acute Decompensated DIC**: Features systemic bleeding (diastasis) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia due to red blood cell shear.

DIC is distinct from other disorders such as thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome, which involve primary platelet activation.

### Causes:

- Sepsis
- Trauma
- Malignancies (both solid tumors and leukemia)
- Obstetric complications

Other causes include peritoneovenous shunts, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, snake envenomation, cirrhosis, heat stroke, amphetamine overdose, and purpura fulminans due to protein C deficiency.

### Management:

Management focuses on supportive care with platelet transfusions, clotting factor replacement, and heparin use. The prognosis depends heavily on the underlying cause of DIC.
