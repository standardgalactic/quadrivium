The text outlines a method for evaluating a surface integral over a cube using Gauss's theorem (Divergence Theorem). Here's a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: Evaluate the surface integral of the vector field \(\mathbf{f}(x, y, z) = (x, y, y^2, z, z^3)\) on a cube bounded by \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 1\).

2. **Gauss's Theorem**: Instead of calculating the integral over each face separately, Gauss's theorem converts it to a volume integral:
   \[
   \iint_{\partial D} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \iiint_D (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dv
   \]

3. **Divergence Calculation**: The divergence of \(\mathbf{f}\) is:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 1 + 2yz + 3z^2
   \]

4. **Volume Integral Setup**: Set up the integral over the cube:
   \[
   \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (1 + 2yz + 3z^2) \, dz \, dy \, dx
   \]

5. **Integration Process**:
   - Integrate with respect to \(z\):
     \[
     z + yz^2 + z^3 \bigg|_0^1 = 1 + y + 1 = 2y + 2
     \]
   - Integrate the result with respect to \(y\):
     \[
     \int_0^1 (2y + 2) \, dy = y^2 + 2y \bigg|_0^1 = 1 + 2 = 3
     \]
   - Finally, integrate with respect to \(x\):
     \[
     \int_0^1 3 \, dx = 3x \bigg|_0^1 = 3
     \]

6. **Result**: Gauss's theorem simplifies the calculation from six surface integrals to one volume integral, yielding a result of \(3\).
