The text presents several physics problems and explanations:

1. **Mass Comparison**:
   - A cup of coffee at sea level (95 degrees) vs. on Mount Everest (95 degrees) is compared, with the latter having more mass due to its potential energy from height.
   - A cup at 60 degrees at sea level has the smallest mass because it lacks both significant heat and gravitational potential energy.

2. **System of Two Positive Charges**:
   - The system's mass is largest when charges are close together due to increased electric potential energy.

3. **Parallel Plate Capacitor**:
   - A charged capacitor (with electrons moved from one plate to another) has a higher mass than an uncharged one because it stores electrical energy.

4. **Accelerating Particles**:
   - Accelerating a proton requires more energy compared to an electron due to the proton's larger mass, reflecting the mass-energy equivalence principle.

5. **Quasar Mass Loss**:
   - A quasar with a power output of \(1 \times 10^{41}\) watts loses mass as it emits energy.
   - Using \(E = mc^2\), the rate of mass loss (\(m/t\)) is calculated as approximately \(1.1 \times 10^{24}\) kilograms per second, meaning a quasar can lose the equivalent mass of Earth in just under six seconds due to its immense power output.

These problems illustrate principles like potential energy, electric potential energy, energy storage in capacitors, and mass-energy equivalence.
