It looks like you're working on solving a differential equation using the method of variation of parameters. Let's break down your steps and clarify the process:

1. **Complementary Solution (\(y_c\))**:
   - You have a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation, likely of the form \(ay'' + by' + cy = 0\).
   - The complementary solution is given by \(y_c = c_1 \cos(3x) + c_2 \sin(3x)\), where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants.

2. **Particular Solution (\(y_p\))**:
   - You're using variation of parameters to find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation.
   - The formula for \(y_p\) is \(y_p = u_1(x) y_1(x) + u_2(x) y_2(x)\), where \(y_1(x) = \cos(3x)\) and \(y_2(x) = \sin(3x)\).

3. **Finding \(u_1(x)\) and \(u_2(x)\)**:
   - The formulas for \(u_1'\) and \(u_2'\) are:
     \[
     u_1' = -\frac{y_2(x) g(x)}{W(y_1, y_2)}
     \]
     \[
     u_2' = \frac{y_1(x) g(x)}{W(y_1, y_2)}
     \]
   - Here, \(g(x)\) is the non-homogeneous part of the differential equation, and \(W(y_1, y_2)\) is the Wronskian of \(y_1\) and \(y_2\).

4. **Calculating the Wronskian**:
   - The Wronskian \(W(y_1, y_2)\) for \(\cos(3x)\) and \(\sin(3x)\) is:
     \[
     W = \begin{vmatrix}
     \cos(3x) & \sin(3x) \\
     -3\sin(3x) & 3\cos(3x)
     \end{vmatrix} = 3
     \]

5. **Integrating to Find \(u_1(x)\) and \(u_2(x)\)**:
   - You found \(u_1(x) = -\frac{1}{12}x\) by integrating \(u_1'\).
   - For \(u_2(x)\), you used substitution with \(p = \sin(3x)\), leading to:
     \[
     u_2(x) = \frac{1}{36} \ln|\sin(3x)|
     \]

6. **Constructing the Particular Solution**:
   - Substitute back into the formula for \(y_p\):
     \[
     y_p = \left(-\frac{1}{12}x\right) \cos(3x) + \left(\frac{1}{36} \ln|\sin(3x)|\right) \sin(3x)
     \]

7. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:
     \[
     y = c_1 \cos(3x) + c_2 \sin(3x) - \frac{1}{12}x \cos(3x) + \frac{1}{36} \ln|\sin(3x)| \sin(3x)
     \]

This process outlines how you derived the particular solution using variation of parameters and combined it with the complementary solution to form the general solution. If there's anything specific you need further clarification on, feel free to ask!
