The text presents a series of physics problems related to electrical circuits and energy costs:

1. **Circuit Analysis with Batteries**:
   - Two batteries are connected in series, each with specified electromotive forces (E1 = 4.4V, E2 = 2.1V) and internal resistances.
   - The circuit includes resistors: R1 (internal resistance of battery 1, 2.3 ohms), R2 (resistor between the batteries, 1.8 ohms), and an additional resistor (5.5 ohms).
   - To find the current in the circuit, use Kirchhoff's loop rule with a net EMF of E1 - E2 and total resistance being the sum of all resistances: R1 + R2 + 5.5.
   - Current \( I = \frac{E1 - E2}{R1 + R2 + 5.5} \).

2. **Potential Difference Across Battery Terminals**:
   - Calculate the potential difference across battery 1's terminals using \( VB - VA = E1 - IR1 \), where \( I \) is the current calculated earlier.

3. **Terminal Potential Difference with Different Current Directions**:
   - If current flows from negative to positive terminal (against EMF), terminal voltage decreases: \( VB - VA = E - IR \).
   - If current flows from positive to negative terminal (with EMF), terminal voltage increases: \( VB - VA = E + IR \).
   - With no current, the terminal potential difference equals EMF.

4. **Battery Energy and Cost Analysis**:
   - A standard flashlight battery delivers 2 watt-hours or 7200 joules.
   - To power a 100-watt lamp for 8 hours (requiring 28,800,000 joules), you need 400 batteries at $0.80 each, totaling $320.
   - Alternatively, using grid electricity at 6 cents per kilowatt-hour is more cost-effective.

The text compares the cost of running a 100-watt light bulb for 8 hours using electricity versus battery power:
- Electricity costs: A 100-watt bulb for 8 hours uses 28,800,000 joules. At $0.06 per kilowatt-hour, this costs 4.8 cents.
- Battery cost: Using a battery providing only 7,200 joules would cost $0.80.

Electricity is significantly cheaper than using batteries at the given rate of 6 cents per kilowatt-hour.
