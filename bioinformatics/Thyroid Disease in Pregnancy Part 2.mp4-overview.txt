This text summarizes information on hypothyroidism during pregnancy, which follows an introductory discussion on thyroid disease. Here are the key points:

1. **Prevalence and Causes**: Hypothyroidism affects about 2.5% of pregnancies, with a higher incidence in iodine-deficient areas. The primary cause is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, followed by previous treatments for Graves' disease and overtreatment of hyperthyroidism. Other factors include the use of antithyroid drugs and medications like ferrosulfate or sucralphate that affect T4 absorption.

2. **Diagnosis**: Diagnosing hypothyroidism in pregnancy is challenging as only 20-30% of women show symptoms, which can be mistaken for normal pregnancy changes (e.g., weight gain, lethargy). Diagnosis relies on elevated TSH levels, but reference values vary due to lack of standardized assays.

3. **Impact and Management**: Hypothyroidism can lead to complications like hypertension, increased C-sections, placental abruption, anemia, postpartum hemorrhage, and preterm labor. It affects fetal development, with untreated hypothyroidism potentially impacting mental capacity. The thyroid hormone is crucial for fetal brain development starting around 7 weeks.

4. **Treatment**: Management includes screening TSH levels at pregnancy diagnosis and monitoring every trimester. Thyroxine treatment should begin immediately in diagnosed cases, with dosage adjustments based on TSH levels to maintain it below 2.5. Proper medication timing relative to prenatal supplements is crucial for efficacy.

5. **Thyroid Antibodies**: About 13-14% of healthy women under 40 have thyroid antibodies, increasing risks like miscarriage and postpartum thyroiditis during pregnancy. Women with elevated TSH levels should receive treatment similar to those with hypothyroidism.

6. **Isolated Maternal Hypothyroxinemia**: Characterized by low T4 but normal TSH in early pregnancy, this condition generally does not lead to negative outcomes and requires no specific treatment currently.
