The text outlines solving the second-order linear differential equation \( y'' - \frac{4}{3}y' + \frac{4}{9}y = 0 \) by using reduction of order. Given one solution, \( y_1 = e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \), the method involves assuming a general solution in the form \( y = u(x) y_1 = u(x) e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \). Differentiation of this product uses the chain and product rules to find expressions for \( y' \) and \( y'' \).

The process continues by substituting these derivatives back into the differential equation, simplifying it using algebraic manipulations. By making a substitution \( w = u' \), an auxiliary equation is derived where solving shows that \( w \) must be constant due to the nature of exponential functions. Integrating this results in \( u(x) = c_2 x + c_1 \).

The second linearly independent solution becomes \( y_2 = x e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \). The general solution is then expressed as \( y = c_1 e^{\frac{2x}{3}} + c_2 x e^{\frac{2x}{3}} \).

The text underscores the importance of meticulous handling of derivatives and algebra to avoid errors. It highlights common pitfalls in calculating derivatives using the product and chain rules, and recommends carefully reviewing reduction of order techniques to ensure accuracy. The speaker commits to revisiting these concepts regularly to minimize mistakes in calculus problems.
