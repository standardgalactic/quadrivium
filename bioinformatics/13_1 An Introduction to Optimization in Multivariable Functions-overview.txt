To determine what type of critical points you have, we need to evaluate the second-order partial derivatives and use them in the context of finding the Hessian determinant, often denoted by \(\Delta\), which is used to classify the critical points. Let's go through this step-by-step for your function:

### Given Function
\[ f(x, y) = x^3 + y^2 - 6xy + 6x - 3y + 1 \]

### First Partial Derivatives (Gradient)
You've already found the gradient:
- \( f_x = 3x^2 - 6y + 6 \)
- \( f_y = 2y - 6x - 3 \)

Setting these equal to zero gives us the critical points, which you have solved as:
1. \( (5, \frac{27}{2}) \)
2. \( (1, \frac{3}{2}) \)

### Second Partial Derivatives
To classify these critical points, we need the second partial derivatives:

- \( f_{xx} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 6x \)
- \( f_{yy} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = 2 \)
- \( f_{xy} = f_{yx} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = -6 \)

### Hessian Determinant
The determinant of the Hessian matrix, \(\Delta\), is calculated as follows:
\[ \Delta = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 \]

Substituting the second partial derivatives:
\[ \Delta = (6x)(2) - (-6)^2 \]
\[ \Delta = 12x - 36 \]

### Evaluate at Critical Points
Now, evaluate \(\Delta\) and \(f_{xx}\) at each critical point:

1. **At \((5, \frac{27}{2})\):**
   - \(\Delta = 12(5) - 36 = 60 - 36 = 24\)
   - \(f_{xx} = 6(5) = 30\)

   Since \(\Delta > 0\) and \(f_{xx} > 0\), this point is a **local minimum**.

2. **At \((1, \frac{3}{2})\):**
   - \(\Delta = 12(1) - 36 = 12 - 36 = -24\)

   Since \(\Delta < 0\), this point is a **saddle point**.

### Conclusion
- The critical point \((5, \frac{27}{2})\) is a local minimum.
- The critical point \((1, \frac{3}{2})\) is a saddle point. 

This classification helps in understanding the nature of these points on the surface described by \(f(x, y)\).

The text appears to be an explanation of a mathematical problem involving partial derivatives, critical points, and determining local extrema for a function. Here's a summary:

1. **Mathematical Setup**: The discussion revolves around a function \( f(x, y) \), where the second partial derivative with respect to \( y \) is constant at 2.

2. **Derivative Calculations**:
   - The expression \( d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 12x \) is derived.
   - For the function's critical point analysis, the term \(\Delta = 12x - 36\) is used to determine local extrema.

3. **Critical Points Analysis**:
   - Two vectors (or points), \( a \) and \( b \), are considered:
     - At vector \( a \) with \( x = 5 \), \(\Delta > 0\), indicating a local minimum.
     - At vector \( b \) with \( x = 1 \), \(\Delta < 0\), suggesting a saddle point or local maximum.

4. **Local vs. Global Extrema**:
   - The text distinguishes between local and global extrema, noting that the presence of boundaries in the domain can affect which points are considered global maxima or minima.
   - It emphasizes that critical points need individual examination to determine their nature (local minimum, maximum, or saddle point).

5. **Graphical Interpretation**:
   - A 3D curve is mentioned to illustrate how local extrema might appear in a graphical representation.
   - The discussion highlights the importance of considering domain boundaries when identifying global extrema.

Overall, the text provides a detailed analysis of determining and classifying critical points for a function using partial derivatives, with an emphasis on understanding both local and potential global behavior based on the domain.

To determine whether the given points are maxima, minima, or saddle points for the function \( f(\mathbf{x}) = x^3 + y^2 - 6xy + 6x - 3y + 1 \), we need to perform a second derivative test using the Hessian matrix. Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Find the Gradient

The gradient of \( f(\mathbf{x}) \) is given by:
\[
\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right)
\]

Calculating each partial derivative:

- \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6y + 6\)
- \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y - 6x - 3\)

Setting the gradient equal to zero gives us the system of equations:
\[
3x^2 - 6y + 6 = 0
\]
\[
2y - 6x - 3 = 0
\]

### Step 2: Solve for Critical Points

From the second equation, solve for \( y \):
\[
2y = 6x + 3 \implies y = 3x + \frac{3}{2}
\]

Substitute \( y = 3x + \frac{3}{2} \) into the first equation:
\[
3x^2 - 6(3x + \frac{3}{2}) + 6 = 0
\]
\[
3x^2 - 18x - 9 + 6 = 0
\]
\[
3x^2 - 18x - 3 = 0
\]

Divide the entire equation by 3:
\[
x^2 - 6x - 1 = 0
\]

Solve using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{40}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 2\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]
\[
x = 3 \pm \sqrt{10}
\]

For \( x = 3 + \sqrt{10} \):
\[
y = 3(3 + \sqrt{10}) + \frac{3}{2} = 9 + 3\sqrt{10} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{21}{2} + 3\sqrt{10}
\]

For \( x = 3 - \sqrt{10} \):
\[
y = 3(3 - \sqrt{10}) + \frac{3}{2} = 9 - 3\sqrt{10} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{21}{2} - 3\sqrt{10}
\]

Critical points are:
- \( (3 + \sqrt{10}, \frac{21}{2} + 3\sqrt{10}) \)
- \( (3 - \sqrt{10}, \frac{21}{2} - 3\sqrt{10}) \)

### Step 3: Determine the Nature of Each Critical Point

Compute the second partial derivatives:

- \( f_{xx} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 6x \)
- \( f_{yy} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = 2 \)
- \( f_{xy} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = -6 \)

The Hessian matrix \( H \) is:
\[
H = \begin{bmatrix}
f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
f_{xy} & f_{yy}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
6x & -6 \\
-6 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of the Hessian is:
\[
\det(H) = (6x)(2) - (-6)(-6) = 12x - 36
\]

Evaluate \( \det(H) \) and \( f_{xx} \) at each critical point:

1. **At \( (3 + \sqrt{10}, \frac{21}{2} + 3\sqrt{10}) \):**

   \[
   \det(H) = 12(3 + \sqrt{10}) - 36 = 36 + 12\sqrt{10} - 36 = 12\sqrt{10}
   \]
   \[
   f_{xx} = 6(3 + \sqrt{10}) = 18 + 6\sqrt{10}
   \]

   Since \( \det(H) > 0 \) and \( f_{xx} > 0 \), this point is a local minimum.

2. **At \( (3 - \sqrt{10}, \frac{21}{2} - 3\sqrt{10}) \):**

   \[
   \det(H) = 12(3 - \sqrt{10}) - 36 = 36 - 12\sqrt{10} - 36 = -12\sqrt{10}
   \]

   Since \( \det(H) < 0 \), this point is a saddle point.

### Conclusion

- The point \( (3 + \sqrt{10}, \frac{21}{2} + 3\sqrt{10}) \) is a local minimum.
- The point \( (3 - \sqrt{10}, \frac{21}{2} - 3\sqrt{10}) \) is a saddle point.

The text appears to be a mathematical discussion involving the analysis of a function, focusing on identifying local extrema (minimums and maximums) through partial derivatives.

Here's a summary:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function is analyzed using its second partial derivatives with respect to variables \(x\) and \(y\).
   - The second partial derivative with respect to \(y\) results in a constant 2.
   - A formula involving these derivatives (\(D_1^2 + D_2^2\)) simplifies to \(12x\).

2. **Critical Points**:
   - Two critical points (vectors) are examined: vector \(\mathbf{a}\) at \(x = 5\) and vector \(\mathbf{b}\) at \(x = 1\).
   - For vector \(\mathbf{a}\), the calculation of \(\Delta = 12x - 36\) results in a positive value (24), indicating a local minimum since both \(\Delta > 0\) and \(D_1^2 > 0\).

3. **Second Critical Point**:
   - For vector \(\mathbf{b}\), the calculation of \(\Delta = 12x - 36\) results in a negative value (-24), indicating a local maximum since \(\Delta < 0\).

4. **Global Extrema Considerations**:
   - The discussion notes that these points are not necessarily global extrema.
   - Depending on the domain, extremum points could occur at the boundaries or periphery of the function's defined region.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Each critical point must be individually examined to determine if it is a local minimum or maximum.
   - The determination involves checking the sign of \(\Delta\) and possibly further analysis of \(D_1^2\).

This analysis emphasizes understanding both local behavior at specific points and potential global behavior across the entire domain.
