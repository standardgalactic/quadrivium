To determine what type of critical points you have, we need to evaluate the second-order partial derivatives and use them in the context of finding the Hessian determinant, often denoted by \(\Delta\), which is used to classify the critical points. Let's go through this step-by-step for your function:

### Given Function
\[ f(x, y) = x^3 + y^2 - 6xy + 6x - 3y + 1 \]

### First Partial Derivatives (Gradient)
You've already found the gradient:
- \( f_x = 3x^2 - 6y + 6 \)
- \( f_y = 2y - 6x - 3 \)

Setting these equal to zero gives us the critical points, which you have solved as:
1. \( (5, \frac{27}{2}) \)
2. \( (1, \frac{3}{2}) \)

### Second Partial Derivatives
To classify these critical points, we need the second partial derivatives:

- \( f_{xx} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 6x \)
- \( f_{yy} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} = 2 \)
- \( f_{xy} = f_{yx} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} = -6 \)

### Hessian Determinant
The determinant of the Hessian matrix, \(\Delta\), is calculated as follows:
\[ \Delta = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 \]

Substituting the second partial derivatives:
\[ \Delta = (6x)(2) - (-6)^2 \]
\[ \Delta = 12x - 36 \]

### Evaluate at Critical Points
Now, evaluate \(\Delta\) and \(f_{xx}\) at each critical point:

1. **At \((5, \frac{27}{2})\):**
   - \(\Delta = 12(5) - 36 = 60 - 36 = 24\)
   - \(f_{xx} = 6(5) = 30\)

   Since \(\Delta > 0\) and \(f_{xx} > 0\), this point is a **local minimum**.

2. **At \((1, \frac{3}{2})\):**
   - \(\Delta = 12(1) - 36 = 12 - 36 = -24\)

   Since \(\Delta < 0\), this point is a **saddle point**.

### Conclusion
- The critical point \((5, \frac{27}{2})\) is a local minimum.
- The critical point \((1, \frac{3}{2})\) is a saddle point. 

This classification helps in understanding the nature of these points on the surface described by \(f(x, y)\).

The text appears to be an explanation of a mathematical problem involving partial derivatives, critical points, and determining local extrema for a function. Here's a summary:

1. **Mathematical Setup**: The discussion revolves around a function \( f(x, y) \), where the second partial derivative with respect to \( y \) is constant at 2.

2. **Derivative Calculations**:
   - The expression \( d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 12x \) is derived.
   - For the function's critical point analysis, the term \(\Delta = 12x - 36\) is used to determine local extrema.

3. **Critical Points Analysis**:
   - Two vectors (or points), \( a \) and \( b \), are considered:
     - At vector \( a \) with \( x = 5 \), \(\Delta > 0\), indicating a local minimum.
     - At vector \( b \) with \( x = 1 \), \(\Delta < 0\), suggesting a saddle point or local maximum.

4. **Local vs. Global Extrema**:
   - The text distinguishes between local and global extrema, noting that the presence of boundaries in the domain can affect which points are considered global maxima or minima.
   - It emphasizes that critical points need individual examination to determine their nature (local minimum, maximum, or saddle point).

5. **Graphical Interpretation**:
   - A 3D curve is mentioned to illustrate how local extrema might appear in a graphical representation.
   - The discussion highlights the importance of considering domain boundaries when identifying global extrema.

Overall, the text provides a detailed analysis of determining and classifying critical points for a function using partial derivatives, with an emphasis on understanding both local and potential global behavior based on the domain.

It seems like there might be a formatting issue with your request, as it lists "21. 22. 22." without any accompanying text to summarize. Could you please provide the text or context you would like summarized? This will help me give you an accurate and helpful response.
