Up until now we have simply integrated or taken the antiderivative of simple functions.
Here we have the indefinite integral of x squared.
The variable with respect to which we are taking the integral appears on its own.
Here it appears as part of the subtraction of two functions.
The first function can be named f , that is x cubed,
and the second the g , that is 2 over x.
And we can represent our example in this way.
But what if the element being integrated is a product of two functions, such as x times the cosine of x?
This is not simple addition or subtraction of two functions.
Just as we use the product rule in differentiation, we need a product rule for integration.
In actual fact, we will use differentiation and its product rule to devise such a product rule for integration.
First of all, let us look at the product rule for differentiation of two functions with the same variable.
The derivative of the product of two functions with the same variable
is the first derivative of the first function times the second function
plus the first function times the first derivative of the second function.
Now let us take the indefinite integral of both sides.
Note that we used the addition rule for integration on the right hand side.
On the left, we are taking the integral of the first derivative of a function, and that just leaves the function,
or in this case the product of two functions.
Let us use some algebra and get the second term on the right hand side on its own.
And here we have a formula for integrating the product of two functions with the same variable
as which we are integrating with respect to.
It might not look impressive, but let us illustrate with an example.
Here we have the indefinite integral of x times the cosine of x with respect to x, our example above.
It represents the left hand side of our formula.
We have the product of two functions here.
We only have to decide which one is to be the f and which one is to be the g' .
Looking towards the right hand side of our formula, we see that we will need to get the first derivative of the f
and the anti-derivative of the g' .
We need to make a cunning decision here, one that will make our subsequent calculations simpler.
If we choose x as the f , we will have 1 as its first derivative,
and that will be a lot simpler than choosing x to be our g' .
The anti-derivative of x is a half x squared plus c, which is a more complicated than 1.
So if x is our f , and the cosine of x is our g' , we can write our formula as such.
If the first derivative of the g of x is the cosine of x, then the original g of x is the sine of x.
Remember the first derivative of the sine of x is the cosine of x.
And the first derivative of x is 1.
If we simplify we get this.
The anti-derivative of the sine of x is negative the cosine of x plus c.
We have used our derived formula to solve our first integral of a product.
majority of x is a single-electward % of x is a single-drift toями and number f is something or c.
Now we will use x is a single-m n a江 of x is a single-dimensional and we can name them np are a camera of x.
And for a long term, there and there are elements that are���
