The text defines and proves that the center of a group \( Z(G) \) is a subgroup of the group \( G \). The center, denoted as \( Z(G) \), consists of elements in \( G \) that commute with every element in \( G \); formally, for any \( z \in Z(G) \) and any \( g \in G \), the equation \( zg = gz \) holds.

To show that \( Z(G) \) is a subgroup of \( G \), it must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.

1. **Closure**: If \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are in \( Z(G) \), then their binary operation (composition) \( g_1g_2 \) is also in \( Z(G) \). This follows because for any arbitrary element \( s \in G \):
   - \( (g_1g_2)s = g_1(g_2s) = g_1(s g_2) = (g_1s)g_2 = (sg_1)g_2 = s(g_1g_2) \).

2. **Associativity**: Since associativity is inherited from \( G \), it holds in \( Z(G) \) as well.

3. **Identity Element**: The identity element \( e \) of \( G \) commutes with all elements in \( G \), hence \( e \in Z(G) \).

4. **Inverses**: For any \( g \in Z(G) \), its inverse \( g^{-1} \) is also in \( Z(G) \). This can be shown by considering:
   - \( g^{-1}(sg) = (g^{-1}s)g = (sg^{-1})g = s(g^{-1}g) = se = s \),
   - and similarly, \( (sg^{-1})g = s(g^{-1}g) = se = s \).
   Thus, \( g^{-1}s = sg^{-1} \).

Since all these properties are satisfied, the center of a group \( Z(G) \) is indeed a subgroup of \( G \).
