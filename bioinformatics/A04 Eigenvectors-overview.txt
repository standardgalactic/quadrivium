The text describes solving a set of linear differential equations by finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: Solve the system of linear differential equations using given solutions.

2. **Matrix Setup**:
   - Use matrix \( A \) and subtract \( \lambda I \) (where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) is a scalar).
   - The determinant of \( A - \lambda I \) must be zero to find eigenvalues.

3. **Eigenvalue Calculation**:
   - For a 2x2 matrix, there are two eigenvalues.
   - First eigenvalue (\( \lambda_1 = -2 \)) is used to form the equation \( (A - \lambda_1 I)K = 0 \).

4. **Eigenvector for \( \lambda_1 \)**:
   - Solve \( (A - (-2)I)K = 0 \).
   - Resulting in \( K_1 + K_2 = 0 \), leading to eigenvector \( [1, -1] \).

5. **Solution Interpretation**:
   - The solution is expressed as \( X = e^{-2t} \) and \( Y = -e^{-2t} \).

6. **Second Eigenvalue Calculation**:
   - Use second eigenvalue (\( \lambda_2 = 6 \)) to find another eigenvector.
   - Solve \( (A - 6I)K = 0 \), resulting in the relationship \( 5K_3 = 3K_4 \).

7. **Eigenvector for \( \lambda_2 \)**:
   - Choose \( K_4 = 5 \) and \( K_3 = 3 \), leading to eigenvector \( [3, 5] \).

8. **Solution Confirmation**:
   - The solutions match the given answers, confirming the correctness of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The process involves using characteristic equations to find eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, which are then used to express solutions to the differential equations.
