The text describes solving a set of linear differential equations by finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: Solve the system of linear differential equations using given solutions.

2. **Matrix Setup**:
   - Use matrix \( A \) and subtract \( \lambda I \) (where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) is a scalar).
   - The determinant of \( A - \lambda I \) must be zero to find eigenvalues.

3. **Eigenvalue Calculation**:
   - For a 2x2 matrix, there are two eigenvalues.
   - First eigenvalue (\( \lambda_1 = -2 \)) is used to form the equation \( (A - \lambda_1 I)K = 0 \).

4. **Eigenvector for \( \lambda_1 \)**:
   - Solve \( (A - (-2)I)K = 0 \).
   - Resulting in \( K_1 + K_2 = 0 \), leading to eigenvector \( [1, -1] \).

5. **Solution Interpretation**:
   - The solution is expressed as \( X = e^{-2t} \) and \( Y = -e^{-2t} \).

6. **Second Eigenvalue Calculation**:
   - Use second eigenvalue (\( \lambda_2 = 6 \)) to find another eigenvector.
   - Solve \( (A - 6I)K = 0 \), resulting in the relationship \( 5K_3 = 3K_4 \).

7. **Eigenvector for \( \lambda_2 \)**:
   - Choose \( K_4 = 5 \) and \( K_3 = 3 \), leading to eigenvector \( [3, 5] \).

8. **Solution Confirmation**:
   - The solutions match the given answers, confirming the correctness of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The process involves using characteristic equations to find eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, which are then used to express solutions to the differential equations.

The text describes the process of solving a set of linear differential equations by finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The author provides guidance on using matrix operations, specifically involving \( A - \lambda I \), where \( A \) is a given matrix and \( \lambda \) represents an eigenvalue.

1. **Recap**: It starts by reminding that there should be a negative 2 (an eigenvalue) involved in the calculations.
   
2. **Matrix Setup**: The author explains how to form the matrix \( A - \lambda I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \lambda \) is an eigenvalue.

3. **Eigenvalues Calculation**: Using the determinant condition (\(\det(A - \lambda I) = 0\)), two eigenvalues are identified for a 2x2 system: \(-2\) and \(6\).

4. **First Eigenvalue (\(\lambda_1 = -2\))**:
   - The matrix \( A - (-2)I \) is computed as:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     3 & 3 \\
     5 & 5
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving the equation \((A - \lambda_1 I)K = 0\) yields \( K_1 + K_2 = 0\).
   - Choosing \( K_1 = 1 \), then \( K_2 = -1 \), gives an eigenvector \([1, -1]\).

5. **Solution for the First Eigenvalue**:
   - The solution for the differential equations using this eigenvalue and eigenvector is expressed in terms of exponential functions: 
     \[
     X(t) = e^{-2t}, \quad Y(t) = -e^{-2t}
     \]

6. **Second Eigenvalue (\(\lambda_2 = 6\))**:
   - The matrix \( A - 6I \) is computed as:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     -5 & 3 \\
     5 & -3
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving the equation for this eigenvalue leads to: \(5K_3 = 3K_4\), or \( K_3 = \frac{3}{5}K_4\).
   - Setting \( K_4 = 5 \), then \( K_3 = 3 \) gives an eigenvector \([3, 5]\).

7. **Solution for the Second Eigenvalue**:
   - The corresponding solution using this eigenvalue and eigenvector is: 
     \[
     X(t) = 3e^{6t}, \quad Y(t) = 5e^{6t}
     \]

The text concludes by demonstrating that solving these linear differential equations involves straightforward matrix operations to find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, which then provide solutions in terms of exponential functions.
