The text discusses intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), conditions where excessive fluid accumulation leads to increased pressure within the abdomen. This condition affects multiple organ systems through various mechanisms:

1. **Fluid Accumulation and Bowel Edema**: Fluid buildup causes bowel edema, increasing intra-abdominal pressure.
2. **Cardiovascular Impact**: Elevated pressure compresses the inferior vena cava, reducing preload and cardiac output, potentially leading to multi-organ failure.
3. **Respiratory Changes**: Increased abdominal pressure elevates thoracic pressure, reducing lung capacity and compliance, predisposing patients to respiratory complications like atelectasis and pneumonia.
4. **Cardiovascular Changes**: Reduced venous return and increased afterload decrease cardiac output despite stable blood pressure.
5. **Renal Complications**: Compression of renal vessels leads to impaired kidney function, oliguria, or anuria.
6. **Gastrointestinal (GIT) Effects**: Decreased perfusion causes mucosal damage and bacterial translocation, contributing to sepsis.
7. **Intracranial Pressure**: Elevated abdominal pressure increases intrathoracic pressure, reducing cerebral venous outflow and increasing intracranial pressure.

**Prevalence**: IAH is common in severe sepsis (41-85%), major surgeries (up to 45%), burns (22-100%), trauma, and pancreatitis.

**Symptoms**: Common signs include abdominal distention, increased respiratory rate, metabolic acidosis unresponsive to fluids, oliguria, hypoxemia resistant to oxygenation, and hypocarbia unresponsive to ventilation.

**Diagnosis and Management**: The World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome recommends screening ICU patients for IAH. Diagnosis involves measuring intra-abdominal pressure using bladder pressure as a standard method. Management follows established protocols when elevated pressures are detected.

Overall, early recognition and management of IAH are crucial to prevent progression to ACS and associated multi-organ failure.
