In this section we're going to look at the line integral of a vector field.
So instead of having this function that we take the line integral of,
we're going to have still a curve, this line, but now it is not in a function,
there's not a function over here but a vector field.
Meaning that at every point, depending on what the function is, the vector field might be different.
So imagine a particle moving along here and every point on its path on this line it will experience a different force.
Well let's take a small element there and we've represented it here at that specific point.
We'll have a certain force and we have this short little line segment and we have an angle between them.
So let's call this little line segment this vector delta r and there's,
depending on how many sections of them you make, there's quite a few of those.
Now think back to very basic physics, we had the fact that work equals force times distance.
But remember the force had to be in the same direction as the distance.
And we can get the component of this force along this direction here inasmuch as if we take the cosine of that angle.
If this is 90 degrees, we take the cosine of this angle, it's certainly going to be this segment or this section,
which we're going to call an f along, or this f along this small section.
Or what we're trying to get is just the component along here and we can do that by taking the cosine of that angle.
And that will leave us here that the length of f times the length of this r times the cosine of the angle between them.
times the cosine of the angle between them.
Now, if we were to finish that, that would be in the direction of this delta r divided by f.
In other words, f in this direction or this section is just going to be f times the cosine.
So there's our f and there's our cosine.
So that would be in the direction of this.
That would be our force component in this direction.
Which is the force there times this distance work equals force times distance.
Now what we can do is we can sum up all these little sections.
All these little sections that our particle travels on.
And we also remember from linear algebra if we have the length of two vectors.
If we have the length of two vectors times the cosine of the angle between them,
it's just a dot product between those two.
The dot product.
And what we should note here is that this is, of course, this is a vector and that is also a vector.
So, we see then in the limit as these sections become smaller and smaller and smaller as they tend to zero,
the sum of all of these work equations is then just the line integral over this path of ours
of the force, function of the force dot product with this dr.
Now, dr, this little differentials or this little short line segments as delta r goes to zero.
We'll just have to learn how to express this properly in order for us to do this line integral of a vector field.
So, let's see.
We'll just see how many layers are enabled.
Alright, here we go.
We'll see.
