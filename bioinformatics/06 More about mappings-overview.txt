The text focuses on clarifying key concepts related to mathematical mappings, particularly the differences between domain, range (or image), and co-domain, as well as types of mappings like onto, bijections, and inverses.

1. **Domain and Co-Domain**: The domain is the set from which elements are mapped, while the co-domain is where these elements map to. For example, mapping natural numbers (\(n\)) to \(n+2\) has a co-domain of natural numbers, but its range excludes 1 and 2 since no input maps to them.

2. **Range**: The range (or image) consists only of the outputs actually obtained from the domain under the mapping. In our example, it's all natural numbers except 1 and 2.

3. **Onto Mapping**: A function is onto if every element in the co-domain has a corresponding element in the domain that maps to it.

4. **Bijection**: This type of mapping is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective), meaning each element in the co-domain corresponds to exactly one element in the domain, and vice versa.

5. **Inverse Mapping**: If a function is bijective, it has an inverse, allowing you to uniquely map from the codomain back to the domain. This highlights the importance of bijections because they guarantee the existence of such inverses.

6. **Composition of Mappings**: When dealing with two mappings (e.g., \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)), their composition (\(\beta\alpha\) or \(\alpha\beta\)) refers to applying one after the other, and the order matters in notation.

The text also introduces a theorem stating that bijective functions have unique inverses, hinting at further exploration of these properties in subsequent exercises.
