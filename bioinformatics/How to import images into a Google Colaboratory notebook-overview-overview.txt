Here's a summary of the step-by-step tutorial on importing and displaying images in Google Colab:

1. **Setup**: Open a new Colab notebook from Google Drive where YouTube tutorials are stored.
   
2. **Initial Steps**:
   - Rename the notebook to "Display Images."
   - Import necessary libraries: `files` from `google.colab` for file handling, and `image` from `IPython.display` for displaying images.

3. **Uploading an Image**:
   - Use `files.upload()` to create a variable called `uploaded`, which allows you to select a file through the browser.
   - Choose an image (e.g., "krg logo light.png") to upload, confirming its progress and completion.

4. **Displaying the Image**:
   - Display the uploaded image using `display.Image` with the filename as it appears in Colab.
   - Optionally set parameters like width for better visibility.
   - Run the cell to view the image within the notebook.

The tutorial ends with the successful display of a chosen logo in the notebook.
