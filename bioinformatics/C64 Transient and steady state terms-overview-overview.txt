The text discusses the concepts of "Transient" and "Steady State" terms in mathematical problem-solving. It explains that solutions to certain problems include two sets: a complimentary set known as the transient term, which initially influences the solution but fades over time; and a particular set called the steady state term, which represents stable periodic behavior like oscillations.

When an exponential decay function is multiplied by an independent variable, it forms a non-periodic transient term that eventually disappears from the graph. In contrast, when the driving force divided by mass results in a periodic function (using sine or cosine), both sets contribute to forming the steady state term. Ultimately, as time progresses, the transient component diminishes, leaving only the persistent steady state behavior in the solution. The text briefly mentions issues with using OneNote on Apple systems for printing before returning to this mathematical discussion.
