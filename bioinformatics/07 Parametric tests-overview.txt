The text provides an overview of conducting three common parametric tests using SPSS software: the independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, and simple linear regression.

1. **Independent Samples T-Test**: The focus is on comparing ages between patients with diabetes and those without, using a binary grouping variable (yes/no). Two results are providedâ€”one assuming equal variances and another for unequal variances. In this example, the t-test does not show a statistically significant difference in age based on diabetes status at an alpha level of 0.05.

2. **One-Way ANOVA**: This test is used to compare means across multiple groups with "age" as the dependent variable and "grade" as the independent factor. The example shows a non-significant result (p-value = 0.736), indicating no significant difference in age based on grades at an alpha level of 0.05.

3. **Simple Linear Regression**: A scatter plot is used to explore the relationship between age and temperature, which does not show a clear correlation. The linear regression analysis also results in a non-significant p-value (0.468), indicating no significant linear relationship between heart rate and age. 

Throughout, the text emphasizes that assumptions for parametric tests are not tested, and the focus is on demonstrating how to perform these analyses in SPSS rather than validating the use of parametric tests over non-parametric alternatives.
