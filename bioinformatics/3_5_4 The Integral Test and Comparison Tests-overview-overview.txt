The text outlines methods for determining the convergence or divergence of infinite series using comparison tests and provides examples:

1. **Comparison Test Basics**:
   - If \(0 \leq A_k \leq B_k\) and \(\sum B_k\) converges, then \(\sum A_k\) also converges.
   - Conversely, if \(\sum A_k\) diverges and \(A_k \leq B_k\), then \(\sum B_k\) diverges too.

2. **Example**:
   - Series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 + 5k}\) converges because it is less than the convergent p-series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\).
   - Series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 - 5k}\) cannot be directly compared to \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) due to reversed inequality.

3. **Geometric Series Example**:
   - Series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{5(k+1)}{2^{k-1}}\) diverges because it approximates the divergent geometric series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{5}{2^k}\).

4. **Limit Comparison Test**:
   - If \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{A_k}{B_k} = c\) with \(c > 0\), both series converge or diverge together.
   - Applied to \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 - 5k}\): the limit comparison test is useful when direct comparison fails.

The text emphasizes understanding these tests' conditions and uses examples to illustrate their application. The limit comparison test simplifies analysis by showing convergence through limits, as demonstrated with expressions converging to a constant value.
