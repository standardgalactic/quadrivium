The text explains using substitution in integration after introducing the product rule. It provides an example: finding the indefinite integral of \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} \cdot 2x\) with respect to \(x\). The solution involves recognizing that the derivative of \(x^2\) is \(2x\), suggesting a substitution with \(u = 1 + x^2\), leading to \(du = 2x \, dx\). Substituting these into the integral simplifies it to \(\int u^{1/2} \, du\), which integrates to \(\frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} + C\). Reverting back to \(x\), the final answer is \(\frac{2}{3}(1 + x^2)^{3/2} + C\). The rest of the text contains unrelated or irrelevant information.
