Okay we've seen some lovely graphs and you're starting to get an idea what graphs are all about.
A very interesting type of graph that I want to show you just in this video. We'll just go to
Mathematica and we'll we'll have a look at the few is this one the planar graph. Let's go to
Mathematica and let's go have a look what it's all about. So here we are Mathematica let's have a
look at this wonderful world of planar graphs. Now planar graph is really a graph that you can draw
such that you can draw the the vertices and then the edges that connect them in a plane so on a flat
surface not in any kind of three dimensions on a flat surface such that the edges do not cross each
other. There's no crossing of the edges. Let's have a look. If I were to just make the following graph
let's go there we'll open a new we've got a new cell there let's start typing graph
and we use autocomplete and I'm just going to make a list here of the edges so that's one
remember escape u e escape undirected edge one with two let's take one with with three so one goes to two and
one also goes to three and one also goes to four four let's make two go to three so two is an edge
between two and three and let's have an edge between two and four so two undirected edge and four and
lastly we have three and undirected edge and four let's close our list there of all our edges and
we'll save vertex labels we want the name of our vertices please let's have a look at that
is this a planar graph well by the looks of it it is not because we do have
the two edges the edge between nodes one and three and between nodes two and four they do cross
so is this a planar graph is it possible that this perhaps you know that this is a planar graph
and I claim that it is because I just want to draw it in a slightly different way by using the complete
graph let's say complete graph and we're going to make the complete graph on four nodes or vertices
please let's make the vertex labels let's make them the name and now have a look at this because you
can clearly see this is the complete graph every node or vertex is connected to every other one
but let's have a look at this I've just redrawn it so imagine just I take this node one and I drag it
into this triangle made by two three and four that's all we did if this if I drag this one out
between two and four now if I were to drag this down I'd have exactly what I had here and just
turned it a couple of degrees I'd have exactly the same but by dragging it in I noticed that this is
indeed very simply put this is a planar graph so if I look at this I might not call it a planar graph
but that is just the particular way that it was drawn I can redraw this exact same graph look at
these two they're exactly the same I have four vertices it is a complete graph there's edges
between each one of those there's nothing different between these two I drew them differently the drawing
of them makes no difference whatsoever and that is really what I get what I want to try and get home
here is these things are abstract ideas we might see this line and we might see a little dot there
but it's not about the dots and the lines it's this concept of a node that is at the end of two
you know at two edges and and it's this very abstract thing and the way that you draw it has nothing to do
with it and I can show you this there's a function called planar graph q so let's do planar graph q and
that says is this a planar graph now let me show you something different about Mathematica that you
haven't seen before if I were to just pass the percentage sign as a single argument what that is
going to do it is going to say what cell was executed last what piece of code was executed last time
use all of that code so this whole line now I can go back and execute this one so let's execute this
again this is now the last thing that was executed you see I did some other work in Mathematica before
this recording so this was in 18 and out 18 and this now becomes in 19 and out 19 so it says that this
was now executed after that this percentage sign will be the last thing that was executed that's
not the thing above not necessarily it just means the last thing that was executed so it's this whole
line so I can copy and paste actually this whole line and pass it as an argument so I'm just asking
is that a planar graph and it says true even though you can clearly see the lines have crossed and that's
just because of the way it was drawn it has you really have to look at a way that you can manipulate
a graph just to see if it really is a planar graph and it's very difficult to prove that a graph is
planar very very difficult it's easier to prove that it's not because you just have to find
or it's easier just to prove somewhere in the in the sub graph that there is a part that you can
really not draw that that the lines do the edges do not cross so let's look at the complete graph let's
look at the complete graph in five nodes and let's make vertex labels the name and shift enter shift
return and there is a beautiful complete graph and five nodes let's just ask Mathematica let's not
worry about this and all we're going to say planar graph q we're just going to ask it and instead of
putting the percent sign let me show you I can just copy and paste copy and paste this whole thing in as
an argument that would be the same as having put the percentage in and you see it's false there is no way
that I can redraw this that the edges are not going to cross okay that can never ever be a planar graph
let me show you something a hypercube hypercube graph we've never seen that one before hypercube
graph let me just show you what it looks like before we we get to it a hypercube graph with
i'm going to say three and it doesn't mean this is not an argument to say there are only three vertices
let me show you that there are actually eight vertices here and i'm going to say vertex labels please
give me the name look how beautiful a hypercube is and now i can ask you is it possible to draw this
so that it is not so that it is not these edges do not cross because if i say something like this
planar graph q and the previous thing that we had executed it's just this shorthand code it's true
it can be done and the way that it's done is let me just show you the code it's very easy to do i'm
going to say make for me please a planar graph so hey mathematical can do this for me i can say turn this
that we've just had into a planar graph for me please so let's just do this hypercube
hypercube graph hypercube graph
three and then let's do vertex labels again so that you can see there's no cheating going on here
name we'll put in close our square braces for the hypercube graph function close the square brackets
for the planar graph exactly the same graph these two are exactly the same the drawing of it does not
make it any different look at it look what is connected to what and you'll notice that it's exactly
the same you can give these you know just shifting them you you can clearly draw this very same thing
without any any any of these edges crossing so that is a planar graph they are fascinating graphs and
it's hard work to show to prove actually that a graph is planar it's very easy with these graphs and
it's very mathematical is very powerful the wolfram language very powerful that we can we can ask it to
to redraw something as a planar graph if indeed it was a planar graph and it will do that for you
but to prove this if you're just given a graph or or with the edges and the nodes sometimes well it is
can be as we scale up very very difficult to prove this for now play around with these new functions
that i've shown you draw some wonderful graphs check whether they are planar graphs or not see if you
can figure it out if you just use pen and paper or pencil and paper enjoy planar graphs
