The text discusses a scenario involving simple harmonic motion where an object is set into motion from rest (zero initial velocity). Initially, the position as a function of time involves two constants, \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), with \( c_2 \) associated with a sine term that represents velocity. Because the initial velocity is zero, \( c_2 \) becomes 0, simplifying the equation to only involve \( c_1 \).

The position over time, \( x(t) \), is then expressed as \( 0.1 \cos(10\sqrt{2}t) \). Here, \( c_1 \) (with a value of 0.1) represents the amplitude of oscillation, indicating that the object's motion oscillates between +0.1 and -0.1 units around an equilibrium point. This describes simple harmonic motion characterized by symmetrical back-and-forth movement.
