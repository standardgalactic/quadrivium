The text explores the cancellation law in group theory, a branch of abstract algebra. The cancellation law states that if \( AB = AC \) and \( A \) is invertible, then multiplying both sides by \( A^{-1} \) on the left yields \( B = C \). This law depends on key properties of groups:

- **Associativity**: Allows reordering within parentheses.
- **Identity Element**: An element \( E \) such that \( AE = EA = A \).
- **Inverse Elements**: Each element has an inverse, satisfying \( AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = E \).

Using these properties, the cancellation law helps demonstrate that if \( AB = E \), then \( B = A^{-1} \) and \( A = B^{-1} \). This means two elements whose product is the identity are inverses of each other. The text emphasizes how group theory's structure supports such logical deductions in abstract algebra.
