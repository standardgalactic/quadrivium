The text provides an example and explanation for solving a specific type of differential equation: a linear, second-order, non-homogeneous, ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. Here's a summary:

1. **General Solution Approach**: The general solution to such equations is the sum of a complementary solution (\(y_c\)) and a particular solution (\(y_p\)).

2. **Complementary Solution**:
   - The complementary solution is found by setting the non-homogeneous term (right-hand side) to zero, resulting in \(y'' + 4y' - 2y = 0\).
   - This leads to an auxiliary equation: \(m^2 + 4m - 2 = 0\).
   - Solving this quadratic equation gives roots \(m_1 = -2 + \sqrt{6}\) and \(m_2 = -2 - \sqrt{6}\).
   - Thus, the complementary solution is \(y_c = c_1 e^{(-2+\sqrt{6})x} + c_2 e^{(-2-\sqrt{6})x}\).

3. **Particular Solution**:
   - The non-homogeneous term on the right-hand side is a second-order polynomial: \(2x^2 - 3x + 6\).
   - A particular solution of similar form, \(y_p = ax^2 + bx + c\), is assumed.
   - Derivatives are calculated: \(y'_p = 2ax + b\) and \(y''_p = 2a\).
   - Substituting these into the differential equation gives a system of equations for coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
     - \(-2a = 2\) (for \(x^2\) terms),
     - \(8a - 2b = -3\) (for \(x\) terms),
     - \(2a + 4b - 2c = 6\) (constant terms).
   - Solving these, we find \(a = -1\), \(b = -\frac{5}{2}\), and \(c = -9\).
   - Thus, the particular solution is \(y_p = -x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 9\).

4. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution combines both solutions: 
     \[
     y = c_1 e^{(-2+\sqrt{6})x} + c_2 e^{(-2-\sqrt{6})x} - x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 9
     \]

This comprehensive approach outlines how to solve a specific type of differential equation by finding both the complementary and particular solutions.

The text describes solving a specific type of differential equation: a linear, second-order, non-homogeneous, ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The goal is to find the general solution, which consists of two parts: a complementary solution and a particular solution.

1. **Complementary Solution (y_c):** 
   - To find this, the right-hand side (g(x)) of the equation is set to zero, transforming it into a homogeneous equation.
   - An auxiliary equation in terms of \( m \) is formed using constant coefficients: \( m^2 + 4m - 2 = 0 \).
   - Solving for \( m \), we find two roots: \( m_1 = -2 + \sqrt{6} \) and \( m_2 = -2 - \sqrt{6} \).
   - The complementary solution is then expressed as a linear combination of exponentials based on these roots: 
     \[
     y_c = c_1 e^{(-2 + \sqrt{6})x} + c_2 e^{(-2 - \sqrt{6})x}
     \]

2. **Particular Solution (y_p):**
   - Since the non-homogeneous term \( g(x) \) is a second-order polynomial (\( 2x^2 - 3x + 6 \)), a particular solution of the same form, \( ax^2 + bx + c \), is assumed.
   - Derivatives are calculated: \( y'_p = 2ax + b \) and \( y''_p = 2a \).
   - Substituting into the differential equation, coefficients for powers of \( x \) are matched on both sides:
     - Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \(-2a = 2\) gives \( a = -1 \).
     - Coefficient of \( x \): \(8a - 2b = -3\), substituting \( a = -1 \), results in \( b = -5/2 \).
     - Constant term: \(2a + 4b - 2c = 6\) leads to \( c = -9 \).
   - The particular solution is thus:
     \[
     y_p = -x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 9
     \]

3. **General Solution:**
   - The general solution combines the complementary and particular solutions:
     \[
     y = c_1 e^{(-2 + \sqrt{6})x} + c_2 e^{(-2 - \sqrt{6})x} - x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 9
     \]

This solution process highlights how to handle linear, non-homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients by breaking them into manageable parts.
