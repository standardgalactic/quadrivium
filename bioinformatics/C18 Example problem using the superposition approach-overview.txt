The text provides an example and explanation for solving a specific type of differential equation: a linear, second-order, non-homogeneous, ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. Here's a summary:

1. **General Solution Approach**: The general solution to such equations is the sum of a complementary solution (\(y_c\)) and a particular solution (\(y_p\)).

2. **Complementary Solution**:
   - The complementary solution is found by setting the non-homogeneous term (right-hand side) to zero, resulting in \(y'' + 4y' - 2y = 0\).
   - This leads to an auxiliary equation: \(m^2 + 4m - 2 = 0\).
   - Solving this quadratic equation gives roots \(m_1 = -2 + \sqrt{6}\) and \(m_2 = -2 - \sqrt{6}\).
   - Thus, the complementary solution is \(y_c = c_1 e^{(-2+\sqrt{6})x} + c_2 e^{(-2-\sqrt{6})x}\).

3. **Particular Solution**:
   - The non-homogeneous term on the right-hand side is a second-order polynomial: \(2x^2 - 3x + 6\).
   - A particular solution of similar form, \(y_p = ax^2 + bx + c\), is assumed.
   - Derivatives are calculated: \(y'_p = 2ax + b\) and \(y''_p = 2a\).
   - Substituting these into the differential equation gives a system of equations for coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
     - \(-2a = 2\) (for \(x^2\) terms),
     - \(8a - 2b = -3\) (for \(x\) terms),
     - \(2a + 4b - 2c = 6\) (constant terms).
   - Solving these, we find \(a = -1\), \(b = -\frac{5}{2}\), and \(c = -9\).
   - Thus, the particular solution is \(y_p = -x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 9\).

4. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution combines both solutions: 
     \[
     y = c_1 e^{(-2+\sqrt{6})x} + c_2 e^{(-2-\sqrt{6})x} - x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 9
     \]

This comprehensive approach outlines how to solve a specific type of differential equation by finding both the complementary and particular solutions.
