So now that we've looked at conjugacy in the previous video, let's just look at what we call conjugacy classes.
So conjugacy classes.
And I'm going to claim that they are nothing other than orbits.
And we've looked at the orbits of a set.
So the orbit of a set, now remember here, the set is actually the set that makes up the group.
So this makes it a little bit different.
And so we write it as the conjugacy class of a instead of the orbit of a.
And this is just going to be the set where I take all the elements and I act on a.
So I'm going to choose a specific a, specific element.
This time it's of my group such that g is an element of my group.
So what am I saying here?
So I have the group.
I choose one of the elements.
Then I act on it by all the elements in the group.
And that gives me this orbit of a or the conjugacy class of a.
Now a very interesting thing is going to happen here.
If I have my whole, again if I have my whole group here,
I'm going to be able to partition the group by conjugacy classes.
So let's choose an a that's in there.
Remember, we are talking here about the action of a group on itself, that set as itself.
So this would be the same as saying g, a, g inverse running through all the g's of my group.
This is the exact same thing.
That's how we defined it in the previous video.
So this is what I am left with.
And I'm claiming that this is going to be, this is going to partition it.
And I'm going to have another partition.
And that is going to be from an element b.
And I'm going to have to show that if this b is not one of the elements in there,
then these two sets that I make here has got to be disjoint.
And we'll have to get there.
Let's start with the first one.
So let's say then that no matter, I've got to show that no matter which element I start in here with,
I'm going to end up, you know, with another element that's in here.
So let's choose another element.
And remember, I'm saying that I choose an a from my group,
and I conjugate it like this, and I end up with an element.
So this is actually an element.
So I've got this, this conjugacy class with this new element, g, a, g inverse.
This new element, and my new element here is, is this one.
So a now becomes this thing for one specific g.
So I'm going to choose a very specific g,
because remember this is a lot of elements,
because I'm running through all of the g's here.
But now for one specific g, this is one element.
So how would I, you know, how would that now be?
So that would be the set of all this g dot,
this is the group action on this thing, g, a, g inverse.
And that, for all this g's,
but now I've got to make it a different g.
So I'm going to say g star,
just to show that I'm still running through all my g's.
So all the elements in g.
So I'm running through all of them, acting on this very one specific one.
And I can rewrite, that's that.
And I want to rewrite it as that.
So that is just going to be g star.
g star composed with g, a, g inverse,
composed with g stars inverse.
Okay.
And we know from before,
if I have an inverse and an inverse,
I can rewrite that.
Remember, I'm still running through all the, all of g.
And I can rewrite that one the other way around.
So I'm set here with g star, g.
I'm still with a.
And now I'm with g star, inverse, g, well, g stars, g.
It's inverse.
And I'm still running through all of g.
Still running through all of g.
Now look at this.
That's the same.
And that's the same.
And remember from Cayley's theorem,
if I took one of the element in a group
and I do the binary operation with all the others,
remember I'm going to end up with all the elements again.
Remember the rows and the columns,
they are unique and they are exhaustive.
In other words,
all the elements are there from Cayley's theorem.
So this is just, you know, running through this.
If I take a specific element and I compose it with all of them,
I just end up with that same group again.
So let's call this then g double star, double star.
And I have a and I have g double star.
And it's for all g double star, all the elements of g.
Well, that and that is exactly the same thing
because I'm saying A conjugated with the whole group.
Take A, conjugated with the whole group.
So lo and behold, these two are the same.
C A equals C and G A G inverse.
So no matter what element, other element I take in here,
I started with another element,
I'm going to end up with exactly the same set
as if I just started with A.
And that is well defined
because no matter which one I start with in that set,
I'm going to end up with exactly the same elements in that set.
Now, let's just see that if I take one that is not in there,
so let's take B and I'm going to define B as,
let's have B as this g star.
It's not that g star anymore.
So g star B, g star inverse.
That's going to be my element
because I run through all of them in B.
If these two are not disjoint,
so if I have C A and I have the intersection with C B,
I'm saying that they are disjoint.
If they are not disjoint,
that means this element must be,
you know, one of the elements in there.
In other words,
it's got to be equal to one of the elements in there
because it is in there.
So I'm going to have the fact that G,
A G has got to equal that.
And remember, I'm saying here,
it's all the g and g star,
that's all of g.
So I take this, run through all inverse,
I run through all of them,
and take B and I run through all of them.
And if this was not disjoint,
that means, you know,
this was one group
and this thing is actually inside of there.
So it is one of the ones that is in there.
So they are equal.
Now, what can I do just to express
what B is going to be?
Well, I can compose both sides
by g star's inverse.
So this time, I'm going to have g star's inverse.
And then I have g, A, g inverse.
And if I have g star inverse,
that means it's the identity element.
So I'm left with b, g star's inverse.
And if I write compose with g star,
I'm going to get rid of that.
So I have g star's inverse g.
I have A, associativity.
I have g inverse.
And I have g star.
And I have g star.
Because if I put g star there,
I just have b.
So now I have this curious thing
that B is this.
Well, look at it carefully.
I can rewrite this thing
just as we did there.
So I have here g star.
It's inverse with g.
I have A.
And on this side,
I'm going to have g star's inverse and g.
It's inverse.
Because it's inverse is exactly that.
Because the inverse of this is g inverse.
And g star inverse is inverse,
which is just g star.
So that's all of that equals b.
But hang on a minute.
Hang on a minute.
What's happening here is
I am running through all of my g's.
So by Cayley's theorem again,
I might as well rewrite this as g star star.
A, g star star.
And for all g star star elements of g.
So I'm running through all of them again.
And what do I have left with here?
I'm left with CA.
So if in fact that B was one of A's,
you know, it must just be in A.
It cannot be in its own.
So this is, you know,
for that not to be disjoint,
for these not to be disjoint,
that B must actually be in A.
In other words,
if not so,
then these two things are completely disjoint.
And so I could go for C and D and everything.
In other words,
I have partitioned up,
partitioned up group
by these conjugacy classes.
By these conjugacy classes.
I think there's one interesting thing
I left out.
And that is if,
if I choose A very specifically.
Let's choose A to be an element
of the center of G.
Now if A is the center of G,
remember what happens then.
I would have,
remember how we define the center of G
is that I have G composed with S
equals S composed with G
for all S elements in G.
In other words,
there is commutivity.
And if I defined this as such
and there's commutivity,
meaning I can swap those two around.
So I'll have G,
G inverse A,
and that's just A.
So no matter if I run through the whole of G,
I'll always just end up with A.
A is going to be the only thing left.
It's just going to be A, A, A, A,
no matter what we do.
Because if A was in the center,
it means whatever I'm composing,
whether in the binary operation I do,
I can swap those two around
or those two,
and I'm just left with A.
So A would be the only one.
If A is from the center,
if I chose A in the center,
then A is going to be the only one
in that conjugacy class.
But that's not very interesting.
I'm choosing my A here
such that it's not in the center of G.
And then I actually get,
then I actually do get all of these.
So just watch out for choosing A as a center.
But we can see that
no matter what element I choose,
I'm going to end up in that conjugacy class.
And if I choose something
that's not in that conjugacy class,
I'm going to end up with
two conjugacy classes that are,
that are dis,
that are absolutely disjoint.
So that in short is a conjugacy class.
I'll do it.
All right.
