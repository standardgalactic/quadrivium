As promised, let us have a look at reduced row echelon form.
To get a matrix into row echelon form, we use the elementary row operations that we have seen before.
Doing this is called Gauss elimination.
Carrying on with the elementary row operations is called Gauss-Jordan elimination
and ends with the matrix in reduced row echelon form.
Here's the matrix we were left with in the last video.
It is in a row echelon form.
Let us continue with the elementary row operations.
In every column with a leading 1, we need the other elements to be 0.
Now we work from the bottom up.
How do we get this 2 to be a 0?
We add negative 2 to it.
How do we get this 1 to be a negative 2?
We multiply this row out with negative 2.
This leaves 0, 0, negative 2 and negative 2.
Add these elements to the elements in row 2 and we are left with this matrix.
Now we need to get rid of this 3.
We can multiply row 3 with negative 3.
This leaves 0, 0, negative 3 and negative 3.
Adding these elements to the elements in row 1 leaves this matrix.
Which is now in reduced row echelon form.
And look at the results.
We see that 1x equals 2, 1y equals 3 and 1z equals 1.
Our initial set of linear equations are solved.
Our initial set of linear equations are solved.
Let's look at the results.
We see that 1x equals 2, 1y equals 3 and 1z equals 1.
Our initial set of linear equations are solved.
We see that 1x equals 2, 1y equals 3 and 1z equals 1.
Our initial set of linear equations are solved.
1.
We see that 1x-50, 2x equals 2 and 1z equals.
So, we see that 1x equals 1x minus 1.
The sequence remains involved.
Write those set of linear measures in row 2 and 1z equals 2, 1z equal 1íƒ€.
To flip where 2x goes 14, we need to take a countdown, staff and pitch to the
ball 1 X equals 1, 4x.
