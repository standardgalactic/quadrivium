You're discussing vector operations, specifically focusing on computing areas using cross products and volumes using scalar triple products. Let's break down the key concepts:

### Cross Product

The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\) in three-dimensional space results in a new vector that is perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\). The magnitude of this vector represents the area of the parallelogram formed by \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\).

Given:
\[
\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3), \quad \mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)
\]

The cross product \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}\) is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
w_1 & w_2 & w_3
\end{vmatrix}
=
(v_2w_3 - v_3w_2)\mathbf{i} - (v_1w_3 - v_3w_1)\mathbf{j} + (v_1w_2 - v_2w_1)\mathbf{k}
\]

### Scalar Triple Product

The scalar triple product involves three vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\) and is denoted as \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})\). This operation results in a scalar value that represents the volume of the parallelepiped formed by these three vectors.

Given:
\[
\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)
\]

The scalar triple product can be calculated using the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
w_1 & w_2 & w_3
\end{vmatrix}
= u_1(v_2w_3 - v_3w_2) - u_2(v_1w_3 - v_3w_1) + u_3(v_1w_2 - v_2w_1)
\]

This determinant calculation aligns with the expanded form of \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})\) you derived.

### Geometric Interpretation

- **Cross Product**: The magnitude \(|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}|\) gives the area of the parallelogram spanned by vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\).
  
- **Scalar Triple Product**: The absolute value of \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})\) gives the volume of the parallelepiped formed by vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\).

These operations are fundamental in vector calculus and have applications in physics, engineering, and computer graphics for calculating areas and volumes.
