You're discussing vector operations, specifically focusing on computing areas using cross products and volumes using scalar triple products. Let's break down the key concepts:

### Cross Product

The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\) in three-dimensional space results in a new vector that is perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\). The magnitude of this vector represents the area of the parallelogram formed by \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\).

Given:
\[
\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3), \quad \mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)
\]

The cross product \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}\) is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
w_1 & w_2 & w_3
\end{vmatrix}
=
(v_2w_3 - v_3w_2)\mathbf{i} - (v_1w_3 - v_3w_1)\mathbf{j} + (v_1w_2 - v_2w_1)\mathbf{k}
\]

### Scalar Triple Product

The scalar triple product involves three vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\) and is denoted as \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})\). This operation results in a scalar value that represents the volume of the parallelepiped formed by these three vectors.

Given:
\[
\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)
\]

The scalar triple product can be calculated using the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
w_1 & w_2 & w_3
\end{vmatrix}
= u_1(v_2w_3 - v_3w_2) - u_2(v_1w_3 - v_3w_1) + u_3(v_1w_2 - v_2w_1)
\]

This determinant calculation aligns with the expanded form of \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})\) you derived.

### Geometric Interpretation

- **Cross Product**: The magnitude \(|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}|\) gives the area of the parallelogram spanned by vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\).
  
- **Scalar Triple Product**: The absolute value of \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})\) gives the volume of the parallelepiped formed by vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\).

These operations are fundamental in vector calculus and have applications in physics, engineering, and computer graphics for calculating areas and volumes.

The text you've provided involves some advanced concepts from vector calculus, particularly dealing with cross products and dot products of vectors in three-dimensional space. Let's break down the key points:

### Cross Product
- **Definition**: The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\), denoted as \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}\), results in a third vector that is perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w}\).
- **Calculation**: For vectors \(\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3)\) and \(\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)\), the cross product is calculated as:
  \[
  \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} = 
  \begin{vmatrix}
  \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
  v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
  w_1 & w_2 & w_3
  \end{vmatrix}
  = (v_2w_3 - v_3w_2)\mathbf{i} - (v_1w_3 - v_3w_1)\mathbf{j} + (v_1w_2 - v_2w_1)\mathbf{k}
  \]

### Dot Product
- **Definition**: The dot product of two vectors results in a scalar. For vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\), it is calculated as:
  \[
  \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3
  \]

### Scalar Triple Product
- **Definition**: The scalar triple product involves three vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\) and is given by \(\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})\).
- **Calculation**: This can be expressed as the determinant of a \(3 \times 3\) matrix:
  \[
  \begin{vmatrix}
  u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
  v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
  w_1 & w_2 & w_3
  \end{vmatrix}
  \]
- **Geometric Interpretation**: The scalar triple product represents the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the three vectors. If the result is zero, it indicates that the vectors are coplanar.

### Key Points in the Text
1. **Area Calculation**: The text mentions using the cross product to calculate areas related to triangles and parallelograms formed by vectors.
2. **Determinant Representation**: It highlights how the scalar triple product can be represented as a determinant, which simplifies calculations.
3. **Geometric Significance**: Understanding these products helps in visualizing geometric shapes like volumes and areas in three-dimensional space.

These concepts are fundamental in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics, where spatial relationships need to be quantified.
