The text explains how to find the tangent plane to a function of two variables, \( f(x, y) \), represented in three-dimensional space. Here's a summary:

1. **Function and Graph Representation**: The function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) is considered as a surface in 3D space.

2. **Contour and Tangent Plane**: 
   - A contour of this function at a specific value (e.g., \( c = 2 \)) represents a curve on the surface.
   - The tangent plane to the surface at a point can be found by considering the gradient of the function, which is perpendicular to the contour.

3. **Gradient and Tangent Plane**:
   - For the function \( f(x, y) \), the gradient \( \nabla f = (2x, 2y) \).
   - At a specific point, say \( (1, 1) \), the gradient is \( (2, 2) \).

4. **Higher-Dimensional Approach**:
   - Introduce a new function \( g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z \).
   - The contour of \( g \) at \( z = f(x, y) \) is equivalent to the original surface.
   - Find the gradient of \( g \), which is \( (2x, 2y, -1) \).

5. **Finding the Tangent Plane**:
   - At a point on the surface, say \( (1, 1, 2) \), compute the gradient: \( (2, 2, -1) \).
   - Use this gradient to find the equation of the tangent plane by setting up a dot product with a vector from a known point on the surface to an arbitrary point \( (x, y, z) \).

6. **Equation of Tangent Plane**:
   - The resulting equation is \( 2(x-1) + 2(y-1) - 1(z-2) = 0 \), simplifying to \( z = 2x + 2y - 2 \).
   - This matches the tangent plane found using local linearization.

The text demonstrates two methods for finding the tangent plane: direct calculation using gradients and a higher-dimensional contour approach. Both yield the same result, illustrating a neat mathematical connection between these methods.

The text discusses methods for finding the tangent plane to a surface defined by a function of two variables, \( f(x, y) \), which creates a graph in three-dimensional space. Here is a summary:

1. **Understanding the Graph and Contour**: The surface described by \( f(x, y) \) can be visualized as a 3D shape where each point \((x, y)\) on the plane has a height given by \( f(x, y) \). A contour of this surface at a particular value is like slicing through the surface parallel to the \( xy \)-plane.

2. **Tangent Plane**: The tangent plane at a specific point on the surface can be found using two methods:
   - **Local Linearization Method**: This involves taking the gradient (perpendicular vector) of the function at the given point, which provides the coefficients for the linear equation representing the tangent plane.
   - **Contour Method in Higher Dimensional Space**: By constructing a new function \( g(x, y, z) = f(x, y) - z \), the contour where this equals zero corresponds to the original surface. The gradient of \( g \) at any point on the surface gives a normal vector for the tangent plane.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - For a specific function and point, such as \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) at the point (1, 1), the height is 2, making it (1, 1, 2).
   - Using both methods described results in the same tangent plane equation: \( z = 2x + 2y - 2 \).

The text illustrates that understanding how to derive a tangent plane using these mathematical concepts can be achieved through either direct linearization or by interpreting the problem as finding a contour in a higher-dimensional space. Both approaches yield consistent results, showcasing different mathematical perspectives on the same geometric concept.
