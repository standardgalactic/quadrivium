The text describes a method for calculating the area under the curve of the function \( y = 1 - x^2 \) between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), using Riemann sums from calculus. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Setup**: The goal is to find the area under the curve represented by \( y = 1 - x^2 \).

2. **Divide into Rectangles**:
   - Divide the interval [0, 1] into \( n \) rectangles of equal width \( \Delta x = \frac{1}{n} \).
   - For right Riemann sums, the height is determined by evaluating the function at points \( f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \), where \( k = 1 \) to \( n \).

3. **Summation with Sigma Notation**:
   - The area of each rectangle is calculated as \( f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{n} \).
   - Summing these areas gives the Riemann sum: 
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 - \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2\right) \cdot \frac{1}{n}
     \]

4. **Simplify**:
   - Simplify to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 - \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2
     \]

5. **Calculate the Limit**:
   - As \( n \) approaches infinity, use known formulas for summation to find the limit.
   - The sum of squares formula leads to:
     \[
     \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{2}{6}\right) = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - Therefore, the area under the curve from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
