Let's look at a very, very difficult problem.
And again, it's one of those problems that you probably don't have to solve to be able to do this work.
But it is a problem where you can test yourself to see whether you can come up with an equation.
For instance, when these equations were first written, people looked at the waves and the string,
they could measure it, and they had to work out as we derived.
Remember I showed a video where I said you don't have to worry about this derivation.
You can just memorize the equations, but it's good to understand how to get to an equation.
And this is exactly such a problem.
It tests your powers of reasoning and whether you can play with some ideas to get to an equation.
Now, we had a similar problem in the very first set of videos where we looked at things really simplistically
in an algebraic fashion.
And we're going to use a concept that we used there.
We are told we have a rope, a uniform rope that hangs down.
It weighs, it has a mass M, sorry.
It has a mass M and a length L.
And it just hangs there fixed to the top.
And we are told to take a level Y equals zero at the bottom.
So Y at the top will equal L.
And we need to show that the velocity can be expressed as a function of Y.
Okay, and we need to show that V equals the square root of G, the acceleration due to gravity, times Y.
And then we also have to show that the time taken for a wave to travel this whole length
is going to be two times the square root of the whole length divided by G.
And how to do this?
First of all, let's look at V.
I think let's look at V.
And we know that V, or V squared, then is going to equal tau divided by mu.
And F times lambda.
I don't think we can use F times lambda.
There's no way we can set that up, I think, unless you can come up, unless someone can come up with something clever.
I just put the square root on the other side.
Now mu is going to be easy for us.
That is just going to be mass divided by this whole length.
So the mass M of our order divided by both.
What about mu?
And that's why I said we're going to use a concept that we used before.
Because there is an easy spot.
An easy spot to calculate what the tension in the rope is.
And that's probably halfway down the line.
So we need to go to a spot where Y equals a half L.
Y equals a half L.
At that spot, there is a tension in the rope both up and down.
Because that point is standing still.
It's not moving in the Y direction.
And we can probably use F equals ma for that.
And in this instance, this is going to be our tau at this half point mark.
It's going to be, the tension is going to be the mass of this below the half point mark.
So that's a half M.
That's our mass.
And A is just the A of G or just G.
So tau, right from this point where Y equals a half L is going to be a half Mg.
And obviously that point stands still.
Also, it has tension half Mg down and half Mg up.
So that is in the Y direction cancel.
Because that point stands still as far as the Y direction is concerned.
So I can express, at Y equals a half,
I can express V squared as a half Mg over Ml.
In other words, V squared is going to equal,
the M's will cancel,
the L will go to the top.
So that means, where am I now?
It's going to be Lg divided by 2.
Lg divided by 2.
But at this specific point that we're talking about,
that we're talking about,
L over 2 equals Y.
So V squared equals G.
L over 2 is Y.
In other words, V equals the square root of G over Y.
Beautiful.
That was simple actually, wasn't it?
Because we used this concept of,
that's a simple point halfway up,
that we can look at what the tension is going to be
at that specific spot.
Okay.
Now, this makes sense.
Because remember we said that the velocity
is equal to the square root of the tension
divided by the linear density.
By the linear density.
And if that means,
there's,
how can I put this?
As if Y equals 0,
there's going to be no velocity at this end,
and there's going to be L times G velocity at the top.
Because any point we take in that direction,
we're going to have a difference in tension.
I just used halfway mark because that makes it very easy for me.
This is a bit more involved though.
We've got to show that T equals 2 times the square root of L over G.
And I think the way to start there is that velocity equals distance divided by time.
In other words, time is going to equal distance divided by velocity.
I think that is a place to start.
The distance for us to travel the whole distance is going to be L divided by the velocity.
L divided by the velocity.
Will that get us somewhere?
I think someone can have a look at that and see if that gets us somewhere.
I think what I rather would want to do is
to write the fact that V equals
V equals the square root of G
times Y to the power R.
I've just rewritten that.
I've just rewritten that.
And there's a reason why I want to do that.
Because the velocity of my wave down here is not going to be,
according to this equation,
it's not going to be constant.
Because as Y gets smaller,
until Y equals 0,
the velocity is going to be 0 at the bottom.
It's going to be much higher at the top.
And so what we in essence have is just constant acceleration.
That's all we have.
From the bottom up,
this is going to be constant acceleration.
That's all we're dealing with.
In other words,
we can use an equation such as,
let me use green,
we can use an equation such as
S equals S0 plus V0T plus a half AT squared.
And all we have to do is just to see this as
this being S0,
and the velocity here is going to be 0
because we're substituting a 0 here.
So we're left here with S equals a half AT squared.
AT squared.
In S, we're looking at up there,
the full length.
So the full length is going to equal a half AT squared.
And T squared is going to equal 2 times L divided by A.
Or T is going to equal the square root of 2L divided by A.
I think that is how I did it before.
Now we need an expression for A.
We need an expression for A.
We all know that,
that's why I wrote it like this.
B equals square root of 2 times Y times Y to the power of half.
Just a little bit for that.
And I know an equation for A.
It's dv dt.
So I've just got to do
Y
first derivative of Y with respect to T.
Square root of G is a constant.
So that stays there.
I'm going to integrate this.
So that's going to become a half.
Y to the power of negative a half.
So that comes times dy dt.
So that's implicit differentiation right there.
dy dt is nothing but V.
Remember,
first of all,
the derivative of displacement with respect to time
is this velocity.
And we know what velocity is.
So this is going to be half.
So that's G over,
this is a half,
so that's 2 square root of Y times
V is the square root of G and Y.
And that is A, isn't it?
So the G's are going to cancel,
so we're going to be left with A being
where I'm going to be left with A is
square root of G times square root of G is G.
Square root of Y is I'm going to cancel,
over 2.
A equals G over 2.
Let's substitute that in there.
T equals the square root of 2L
divided by G over 2.
G over 2.
And so 2 divided by a half is 4.
And the square root of 4 is 2.
2 square root of L over G.
2 times the square root of L over G,
exactly where we want it to be.
So it took me a while to do this
on the board on the side.
It took me all of about,
I would say,
10 minutes to come up with this.
But the first part is easy
because we actually,
as I said,
had a problem like this before.
Or if I go to exactly
Y equals a half L,
I can get an equation
for the tension
that is going to be
exactly at that point.
And just using this equation,
then I can get to,
very easily I can get to this.
The second part was a bit more difficult.
But what this states
is that the velocity
is a function of Y circle.
The velocity of any weight down here
is going to be 0
because 1 is 0.
And then the top
is going to be higher.
So all I have
is constant acceleration.
So don't see it as weights anymore.
You'll see it as
your very first class
is in linear acceleration,
linear motion
with constant acceleration.
So the velocity
is just increasing.
So you're going to go back
to your weight
to your original equations.
And if I forget,
if I don't see this
as weights anymore,
I just see this
as constant acceleration.
Knowing that
my,
the total length,
so at that point
there is L,
my S0 is 0,
is Y0,
which is 0.
My V0 at the bottom
is also 0
because this is 0.
So I'm left to the half 80 squared.
So I'm left to this.
And all I had to get
was an equation for A.
It was one of those videos again
where the card was full,
so again,
I'm not sure
where I stopped off.
What I wanted to say again
about this problem,
all I had to get was A.
And it's easy to get A
because I can do
implicit differentiation
because I have an equation
for V and then
VVDT equals A.
So it's one of those problems
that makes you think
how to get up
with an equation.
And look how wonderful it is.
I know if I hang a rope there,
I know what the velocity now is
as a function of Y
with Y being 0 at the bottom.
And I know how long
it's going to take a wave
to travel from the top
to the bottom.
I've got an equation.
I have to memorize it.
I can work it out.
And that's what physics is about.
I've got a problem
and see how can I get
to an equation
to work this out.
So these kind of problems
I think are wonderful.
