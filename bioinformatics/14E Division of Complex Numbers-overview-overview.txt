The text outlines the process of dividing complex numbers, focusing on key concepts like the complex conjugate and modulus, and provides an example. Here's a summary:

### Key Concepts

1. **Complex Conjugate**:
   - For \( z = a + bi \), its conjugate is \( \overline{z} = a - bi \).
   - Example: The conjugate of \( 3 - 4i \) is \( 3 + 4i \).

2. **Modulus**:
   - The modulus of \( z = a + bi \) is \( |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
   - Example: For \( z = -1 \), the modulus is 1.

### Division Process

To divide two complex numbers, multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

- Given \( z_1 = a + bi \) and \( z_2 = c + di \),
- Multiply by \( \overline{z_2} = c - di \):
  \[
  \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}
  \]
- Simplify the denominator to \( c^2 + d^2 \), which is \( |z_2|^2 \).
- Result:
  \[
  \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}
  \]

### Example

Divide \( z = 1 + 4i \) by \( w = 1 - 2i \):

- Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \( w \), which is \( 1 + 2i \).
- Compute:
  \[
  \frac{(1 + 4i)(1 + 2i)}{(1 - 2i)(1 + 2i)}
  \]
- Simplify to find the result.

### Matrix Invertibility and Cramer's Rule

The text also discusses solving a linear system using matrices. The coefficient matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
i & 2 \\
4 & -i
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To determine invertibility, calculate its determinant:

- \(\text{det} = (i)(-i) - (2)(4) = (-i^2) - 8 = -(1) - 8 = -9\)

Since the determinant is non-zero (\(-9\)), the matrix is invertible. Cramer's Rule can be applied to solve the system.

Construct new matrices \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) by replacing columns of the original matrix with the vector \(B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\):

- For \(A_1\), replace the first column:
  \[
  A_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  -1 & -i
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

This summary captures the division of complex numbers and the application of Cramer's Rule in systems with complex coefficients.

The provided text describes the process of solving a system of linear equations involving complex numbers using determinants and Cramer's Rule. Here is a concise summary:

- The matrices involved include \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \). Matrix \( A_2 \) is formed by replacing the second column of matrix \( A \).

- Determinants are calculated for these matrices, specifically \(\text{det}(A_1)\), \(\text{det}(A_2)\), and \(\text{det}(A)\). The determinant of \( A_1 \) is computed as:

  \[
  \text{det}(A_1) = (1)(-i) - (2)(-1) = -i + 2
  \]

- Complex arithmetic, involving the imaginary unit \( i \), is crucial in these calculations. The rules for complex numbers are applied throughout.

- Cramer's Rule is used to find solutions for variables \( X \) and \( Y \). According to this rule:
  - \( X \) is determined by dividing \(\text{det}(A_1)\) by \(\text{det}(A)\).
  - \( Y \) is found by dividing \(\text{det}(A_2)\) by \(\text{det}(A)\).

- The final results for the system are:
  - \( X = i \)
  - \( Y = 1 - i \)

The text emphasizes methodically writing out all steps to ensure accuracy when using Cramer's Rule in systems with complex numbers.
