The text provides an introduction to studying biomathematics with a focus on understanding graphs. It emphasizes that being comfortable with graphs—visual representations of mathematical functions—is crucial for this field. Graphs are depicted in Cartesian coordinate systems with x and y-axes, where points plotted represent values derived from experiments or equations.

The key learning tool mentioned is Desmos, an online graphing calculator available at www.desmos.com. It's accessible through most web browsers without the need for specific software, making it user-friendly for plotting functions and exploring mathematical concepts like slopes (m) and y-intercepts (c).

Using Desmos, users can input equations such as \(y = mx + c\), allowing them to manipulate and visualize how changes in slope and intercept affect the graph. This exploration helps illustrate basic linear functions, which are foundational in biomathematics for modeling various biological phenomena.

The text also outlines features of Desmos like adding points, zooming in/out, changing coordinates, and switching between degrees or radians. These functionalities make it a versatile tool for experimenting with mathematical concepts visually on the Cartesian plane. The overall aim is to familiarize users with essential graph aspects through practical application using Desmos.

The text provides an introduction to studying biomathematics with a focus on understanding graphs. It emphasizes that graphs represent mathematical functions using Cartesian coordinates (x-axis and y-axis), where each point corresponds to specific x and y values. Graphs can be used to derive mathematical functions from experimental data, revealing insights about the represented phenomena.

The text introduces Desmos, an online graphing calculator available at www.desmos.com, which runs on most browsers without requiring any special software. It explains how to use Desmos by starting with basic linear equations like \( y = x \) and manipulating them using sliders for slope (m) and y-intercept (c). The tool allows users to visualize changes in the graph by adjusting these parameters, demonstrating how a straight line's appearance alters with different slopes and intercepts.

Moreover, Desmos offers features such as zooming, plotting points, connecting points to form shapes or lines, and modifying axis scales. It supports various mathematical expressions and can switch between degrees and radians for angle measurements.

The key takeaways from the text are an understanding of first-order linear equations (where the highest power of x is 1), the role of slope as a measure of steepness, and the y-intercept as where the line crosses the y-axis. The video aims to introduce Desmos’s functionality while emphasizing foundational concepts in graphing important for biomathematics.
