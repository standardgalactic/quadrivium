The text provides an introduction to studying biomathematics with a focus on understanding graphs. It emphasizes that being comfortable with graphs—visual representations of mathematical functions—is crucial for this field. Graphs are depicted in Cartesian coordinate systems with x and y-axes, where points plotted represent values derived from experiments or equations.

The key learning tool mentioned is Desmos, an online graphing calculator available at www.desmos.com. It's accessible through most web browsers without the need for specific software, making it user-friendly for plotting functions and exploring mathematical concepts like slopes (m) and y-intercepts (c).

Using Desmos, users can input equations such as \(y = mx + c\), allowing them to manipulate and visualize how changes in slope and intercept affect the graph. This exploration helps illustrate basic linear functions, which are foundational in biomathematics for modeling various biological phenomena.

The text also outlines features of Desmos like adding points, zooming in/out, changing coordinates, and switching between degrees or radians. These functionalities make it a versatile tool for experimenting with mathematical concepts visually on the Cartesian plane. The overall aim is to familiarize users with essential graph aspects through practical application using Desmos.
