in this section we're going to solve systems of linear systems of linear ordinary differential
equations so we have systems of linear equations in an independent variable t so we're not just
solving one equation here we're going to solve two equations we're going to start with the
homogeneous system in other words they both equal zero and i'm going to explain this by by way of an
example so i have two equations here that will be both x and y as functions of t in other words
d dt of x plus d dt plus 2 of y that means d dt of y plus 2y equals zero but that is a system in a
system with this so they've both got to be solved simultaneously whatever solution we get has to
satisfy both of these so that'll be d dt of x minus 3x minus 2y equals zero so i have written it in
differential form and if it's not in differential form first write it in the differential form
so what do we have here well in essence we have two equations in two dependent unknowns x and y
forget the independent variable t now so i've got two equations in two unknowns that was that's and that
is quite easy to solve so let's start by eliminating one of them let's start by eliminating x and if i
rewrite this i get dx here minus i just bring this to the other side and if i solve for x that's what i
get and i can now substitute this into this x second equation so if i substitute this x in there i'm just
going to have functions a function just with y so let's do that so i've substituted it in there now
and it's just very simple algebra and as much as you want to multiply those out i'm going to get a
i'm just going to multiply throughout by d so that i can get rid of this d in the denominator i mean
what would you do if you had to divide by this derivative so i'm just multiplying throughout by d
that's how i get the negative 2d then i'm just going to solve and eventually we left here
and once we left there we recognize this as a homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation
with constant coefficients and i can use the auxiliary equation which is there which leaves
me m sub 1 and m sub 2 note these were constant coefficients so i'm going to be left with a c sub 1
e to the power negative 3t and c sub 2 now you can also swap that around you could have made this
sub c sub 2 and c sub 1 so you can get different answers to these problems but let's do it in a
form going from negative infinity to positive infinity as far as we write the answers are concerned now
we can do the same for x so we can solve for y get x in there and then we can be left with x of t
and we we have m sub 3 m sub that should be m sub 4 when you have m sub 4 and in other words again i'm
going to have this answer and so i've just gone through exactly the same steps as we've had before
now i've got one two three four unknowns here or three four constants and with the original problem
that i have that's just too many constants because it's a linear set and and and they are dependent on
each other these two initial system of two linear equations that i had so c sub 3 and c sub 4 should
actually be we should be able to express them in terms of c sub 1 and c sub 2 so that's what exactly
what we're going to do so for the set of linear equations there cannot be four constants and so we
substitute it now remember we had this differential x that's d dt of x so i have there the d dt and there
is my x of t plus what did we have d dt of y there's my d dt of my y answer and finally plus two times y
this is two times my y answer that's going to be zero i get that derivative i get that derivative that's
easy to do i get e to the power negative three t and e to the power two t out as common factors
now look at this these two for there's no value for t on on the whole interval of the real line
negative infinity positive infinity of t that can be zero so that means both of these terms have got to
be zero and if i let them both be zero
zero if i let them both be zero i can just solve the two of them and i can express c sub 3 in terms
of c sub 1 and c sub 4 in terms of c sub 2 which i then put back in my original two answers i'm going
to have y and c sub 1 and c sub 2 and x then also in c sub 1 c sub 2
