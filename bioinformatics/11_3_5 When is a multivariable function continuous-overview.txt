In multivariable calculus, one of the key concepts is differentiability and finding the tangent plane to a surface. Let's break down the problem you presented:

### Problem Statement
You have a function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \). You want to:
1. Prove that \( f \) is differentiable at the point \( (1, 1) \).
2. Find the equation of the tangent plane at that point.

### Tangent Plane Equation
The general formula for the tangent plane to a surface defined by \( z = f(x, y) \) at a point \( (x_0, y_0) \) is:
\[ 
z = f(x_0, y_0) + (x - x_0)f_x(x_0, y_0) + (y - y_0)f_y(x_0, y_0)
\]
where \( f_x \) and \( f_y \) are the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), respectively.

#### Step 1: Calculate Partial Derivatives
For \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \):
- The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is:
  \[
  f_x(x, y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2 + y^2) = 2x
  \]
- The partial derivative with respect to \( y \) is:
  \[
  f_y(x, y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(x^2 + y^2) = 2y
  \]

#### Step 2: Evaluate at the Point (1, 1)
- \( f(1, 1) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \)
- \( f_x(1, 1) = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( f_y(1, 1) = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)

#### Step 3: Write the Tangent Plane Equation
Substitute these values into the tangent plane formula:
\[
z = 2 + (x - 1)(2) + (y - 1)(2)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
z = 2 + 2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) = 2 + 2x - 2 + 2y - 2
\]
\[
z = 2x + 2y - 2
\]

### Proving Differentiability
A function is differentiable at a point if it can be well-approximated by its tangent plane near that point. Formally, \( f \) is differentiable at \( (1, 1) \) if:
\[
\lim_{(h, k) \to (0, 0)} \frac{f(1+h, 1+k) - f(1, 1) - f_x(1, 1)h - f_y(1, 1)k}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = 0
\]

#### Step 4: Check the Limit
Calculate:
\[
f(1+h, 1+k) = (1+h)^2 + (1+k)^2 = 1 + 2h + h^2 + 1 + 2k + k^2 = 2 + 2h + 2k + h^2 + k^2
\]

Substitute into the limit:
\[
f(1+h, 1+k) - f(1, 1) - f_x(1, 1)h - f_y(1, 1)k = (2 + 2h + 2k + h^2 + k^2) - 2 - 2h - 2k
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
h^2 + k^2
\]

Now evaluate the limit:
\[
\lim_{(h, k) \to (0, 0)} \frac{h^2 + k^2}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = \lim_{(h, k) \to (0, 0)} \sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = 0
\]

Since the limit is zero, \( f \) is differentiable at \( (1, 1) \).

### Conclusion
The tangent plane to the surface \( z = x^2 + y^2 \) at the point \( (1, 1) \) is given by:
\[ 
z = 2x + 2y - 2 
\]
And we have shown that \( f \) is differentiable at \( (1, 1) \).

You're exploring the concept of differentiability for a function in three-dimensional space and verifying the equation of its tangent plane. Let's go through your process step-by-step.

### Problem Setup

You have the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \), and you are interested in finding whether it is differentiable at the point \( (1, 1) \). Additionally, you aim to find the equation of the tangent plane at this point.

### Tangent Plane Equation

The general formula for a tangent plane to a surface \( z = f(x, y) \) at a point \( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \) is:

\[ z - z_0 = f_x(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0), \]

where \( f_x \) and \( f_y \) are the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), respectively.

For your function:
- Compute the partial derivatives:
  \[
  f_x(x, y) = 2x, \quad f_y(x, y) = 2y.
  \]

- Evaluate at \( (1, 1) \):
  \[
  f_x(1, 1) = 2, \quad f_y(1, 1) = 2.
  \]

- The function value at \( (1, 1) \) is:
  \[
  z_0 = f(1, 1) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.
  \]

Plug these into the tangent plane formula:

\[ z - 2 = 2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1). \]

Simplify to get:

\[ z = 2x + 2y - 2. \]

### Differentiability

A function is differentiable at a point if it can be well-approximated by its tangent plane near that point, which involves the limit you've considered.

You need to show:

\[
\lim_{(x, y) \to (1, 1)} \frac{f(x, y) - f(1, 1) - f_x(1, 1)(x-1) - f_y(1, 1)(y-1)}{\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2}} = 0.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[ 
f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, \quad f(1, 1) = 2,
\]
\[
f_x(1, 1)(x-1) = 2(x-1), \quad f_y(1, 1)(y-1) = 2(y-1).
\]

The expression becomes:

\[
\frac{x^2 + y^2 - 2 - 2(x-1) - 2(y-1)}{\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2}}.
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2 - 2x + 2 - 2y + 2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 2y + 1 = (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2.
\]

Thus, the limit is:

\[
\lim_{(x, y) \to (1, 1)} \frac{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2}{\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2}} = \lim_{(x, y) \to (1, 1)} \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2} = 0.
\]

This confirms that the function is differentiable at \( (1, 1) \).

### Conclusion

You've correctly derived the equation of the tangent plane and verified the differentiability of the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) at the point \( (1, 1) \). The tangent plane is given by:

\[ z = 2x + 2y - 2. \]
