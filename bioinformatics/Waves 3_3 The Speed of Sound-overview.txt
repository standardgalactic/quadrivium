The text outlines a series of problems related to waves, specifically transverse and longitudinal waves, with an emphasis on extracting key parameters like frequency, wavelength, velocity, and displacement over time.

1. **Transverse Wave Problem**:
   - The change in pressure as a function of position \( x \) and time \( t \) is given.
   - Maximum amplitude can be directly read from the data: 1.50 pascals.
   - Frequency (\( f \)) calculation involves angular frequency (\( \omega = 315\pi \, \text{rad/s} \)), giving \( f = 157.5 \, \text{Hz} \).
   - Wavelength (\( \lambda \)) is determined using the wave number \( k = 0.9\pi \, \text{m}^{-1} \), resulting in \( \lambda \approx 2.22 \, \text{m} \).
   - Wave velocity (\( v \)) is calculated as \( v = f \times \lambda = 350 \, \text{m/s} \).

2. **Displacement Problem**:
   - Displacement equation: \( s(x, t) = 6 \, \text{nm} \cdot \cos(kx + 3000t + \phi) \).
   - The time elapsed for displacement to change from 2 nm to -2 nm is calculated using inverse cosine functions.
   - Resulting time difference (\( \Delta t \)) is \( 0.23 \, \text{ms} \).

3. **Longitudinal Wave Problem**:
   - Displacement equation for a longitudinal wave includes a phase angle.
   - At \( x = 2 \, \text{m} \), displacement is given as 6 nm, which is also the maximum amplitude.

The text emphasizes understanding and manipulating wave equations to extract key parameters, using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation.

The text discusses how to determine the frequency of a sound wave traveling through a tube using information about displacement at specific points and the velocity of the wave.

1. **Initial Information:**
   - At \( x = 2.07 \) meters, the displacement (\( s_2 \)) is 2 nanometers.
   - The velocity of the wave is given as 343 meters per second.
   - Displacement at another point (\( x = 2 \) meters) is 6 nanometers.

2. **Wave Equation:**
   - The general form for displacement in a wave is \( s(x, t) = s_m \cos(kx - \omega t + \phi) \).
   - At \( x = 2 \) meters: \( 6 = 6 \cos(2k - \omega t + \phi) \), leading to the condition that \( \cos(2k - \omega t + \phi) = 1 \). Therefore, \( 2k - \omega t + \phi = 0 \).

3. **Second Point:**
   - At \( x = 2.07 \) meters: \( 2 = 6 \cos(2.07k - \omega t + \phi) \).
   - Simplifying gives \( \frac{1}{3} = \cos(2.07k - \omega t + \phi) \), leading to the equation: \( \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 2.07k - \omega t + \phi \).

4. **Solving for Wavenumber (\( k \)):**
   - Using both equations:
     - From the first, \( \omega t - \phi = 2k \).
     - Substitute into the second equation: 
       \[
       \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 2.07k - (2k)
       \]
     - Simplify to find \( k \):
       \[
       \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 0.07k
       \]

5. **Calculating Frequency:**
   - Solve for \( k \): 
     \[
     k = \frac{\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}{0.07}
     \]
   - The wavelength (\( \lambda \)) is related to the wavenumber by \( \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k} \).
   - Frequency (\( f \)) can be found using \( v = f\lambda \), where \( v \) is the wave velocity.

By solving these equations, you can determine the frequency of the sound wave.

The text provides a step-by-step solution to an algebraic problem related to wave frequency and velocity. It involves determining the wave number \( k \) from a given equation involving trigonometric functions, specifically using the arc cosine of one-third divided by 0.07. Once \( k \) is found, it's used to calculate wavelength (\( \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k} \)) and frequency (given by \( f = \frac{\text{velocity}}{\lambda} = \frac{\text{velocity} \times k}{2\pi} \)). By substituting known values into these equations, the text concludes with a calculated frequency of approximately 960 Hz. The problem underscores basic algebraic manipulation and understanding relationships between wave parameters such as wavelength, wave number, and frequency.
