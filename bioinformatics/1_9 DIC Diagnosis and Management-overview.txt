This video on disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) covers its clinical presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management. The clinical features of DIC depend on the underlying cause and progression speed, which can be acute or chronic.

1. **Acute Uncompensated DIC**: Characterized by widespread clotting activation that overwhelms anti-clotting mechanisms. Common symptoms include bleeding (in over two-thirds of patients), acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, respiratory issues, shock, thromboembolism, and central nervous system abnormalities. Bleeding manifestations range from petechiae to severe internal hemorrhage. Kidney impairment may result from microthrombosis or hypertension; liver issues might stem from increased hemolysis or sepsis; pulmonary complications can lead to ARDS; CNS dysfunction presents as neurological deficits.

2. **Chronic Compensated DIC**: Often seen in cancer patients, presenting with peripheral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), migrating phlebitis, and arterial thrombosis leading to ischemia or necrosis.

**Diagnosis** involves identifying the underlying cause, checking blood counts for thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic changes, measuring fibrinogen levels, D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). DIC is suggested by elevated D-dimers and evidence of microangiopathy. 

**Differential Diagnosis**: Includes severe liver disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

**Management** focuses on addressing the underlying cause due to high mortality rates (40%-80%). Hemodynamic support is crucial, while antifibrinolytic drugs are avoided. Transfusions of platelets or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are given only in cases of significant bleeding.

When managing patients at risk of serious bleeding, such as those with active peptic ulcers, upcoming surgeries or invasive procedures, and esophageal varices, special attention is needed if the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is significantly elevated—usually more than two—or fibrinogen levels are below 50 mg per deciliter. Treatment typically involves administering platelets at a rate of one to two units per 10 kg daily, along with Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) as needed based on clotting factor levels.

Heparin use is controversial in Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). There's no evidence it helps once DIC develops or prevents its progression after initial thrombosis. It's only recommended for chronic compensated DIC, requiring near-normal antithrombin levels to form the heparin-antithrombin complex that inhibits procoagulant serine proteases like thrombin and factor Xa. If used in acute DIC, it's administered as a continuous infusion at 500 units per hour without an initial bolus, aiming for a Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) of about 45 seconds.

Other management strategies include:

- **Protein C concentrate**: Not suitable to use FFP due to its short half-life. It is considered for patients who are homozygous protein C deficient or have acquired deficiency from conditions like meningococcal septicemia with purpura fulminans.
  
- **Antithrombin**: A randomized controlled trial in cases of sepsis and DIC showed no beneficial effect and even an increased risk of bleeding when used alongside heparin.

- **Recombinant human factor VIIa**: Currently, there is insufficient data supporting its use, though it has been employed successfully as a last-resort measure. 

These interventions require careful consideration of the patient's specific condition and coagulation status.
