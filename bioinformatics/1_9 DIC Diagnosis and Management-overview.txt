This video on disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) covers its clinical presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management. The clinical features of DIC depend on the underlying cause and progression speed, which can be acute or chronic.

1. **Acute Uncompensated DIC**: Characterized by widespread clotting activation that overwhelms anti-clotting mechanisms. Common symptoms include bleeding (in over two-thirds of patients), acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, respiratory issues, shock, thromboembolism, and central nervous system abnormalities. Bleeding manifestations range from petechiae to severe internal hemorrhage. Kidney impairment may result from microthrombosis or hypertension; liver issues might stem from increased hemolysis or sepsis; pulmonary complications can lead to ARDS; CNS dysfunction presents as neurological deficits.

2. **Chronic Compensated DIC**: Often seen in cancer patients, presenting with peripheral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), migrating phlebitis, and arterial thrombosis leading to ischemia or necrosis.

**Diagnosis** involves identifying the underlying cause, checking blood counts for thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic changes, measuring fibrinogen levels, D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). DIC is suggested by elevated D-dimers and evidence of microangiopathy. 

**Differential Diagnosis**: Includes severe liver disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

**Management** focuses on addressing the underlying cause due to high mortality rates (40%-80%). Hemodynamic support is crucial, while antifibrinolytic drugs are avoided. Transfusions of platelets or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are given only in cases of significant bleeding.

When managing patients at risk of serious bleeding, such as those with active peptic ulcers, upcoming surgeries or invasive procedures, and esophageal varices, special attention is needed if the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is significantly elevated—usually more than two—or fibrinogen levels are below 50 mg per deciliter. Treatment typically involves administering platelets at a rate of one to two units per 10 kg daily, along with Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) as needed based on clotting factor levels.

Heparin use is controversial in Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). There's no evidence it helps once DIC develops or prevents its progression after initial thrombosis. It's only recommended for chronic compensated DIC, requiring near-normal antithrombin levels to form the heparin-antithrombin complex that inhibits procoagulant serine proteases like thrombin and factor Xa. If used in acute DIC, it's administered as a continuous infusion at 500 units per hour without an initial bolus, aiming for a Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) of about 45 seconds.

Other management strategies include:

- **Protein C concentrate**: Not suitable to use FFP due to its short half-life. It is considered for patients who are homozygous protein C deficient or have acquired deficiency from conditions like meningococcal septicemia with purpura fulminans.
  
- **Antithrombin**: A randomized controlled trial in cases of sepsis and DIC showed no beneficial effect and even an increased risk of bleeding when used alongside heparin.

- **Recombinant human factor VIIa**: Currently, there is insufficient data supporting its use, though it has been employed successfully as a last-resort measure. 

These interventions require careful consideration of the patient's specific condition and coagulation status.

This video on disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) discusses its clinical presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management. The severity of DIC varies based on the underlying cause and speed of progression. It is categorized into acute uncompensated DIC, characterized by widespread clotting activation and bleeding, and chronic compensated DIC, often seen in cancer patients with symptoms like peripheral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and migratory phlebitis.

In acute uncompensated DIC, more than two-thirds of patients present with bleeding, while others may experience kidney injury, liver dysfunction, respiratory issues, shock, thromboembolism, or central nervous system abnormalities. Bleeding can manifest as petechiae, ecchymosis, or more severe internal bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or brain.

Renal impairment occurs in 25-40% of patients, possibly due to microthrombosis or hypertension. Liver dysfunction may be indicated by jaundice from underlying disease or increased hemolysis. Pulmonary issues can lead to hemoptysis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while central nervous system dysfunction might present as neurological deficits or delirium.

Diagnosing DIC involves identifying an underlying cause, observing thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic changes on blood smears, low fibrinogen levels, increased D-dimers, and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). In cancer-related chronic DIC, fibrinogen might be misleadingly normal due to chronic elevation.

Differentiating DIC from conditions like severe liver disease, thrombotic microangiopathy disorders such as TTP-HUS, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is crucial. Management focuses on treating the underlying cause and providing hemodynamic support while avoiding antifibrinolytic drugs that may increase thrombosis risk. Transfusions of platelets and fresh frozen plasma are reserved for severe bleeding cases.

Overall, DIC has a high mortality rate largely due to its underlying causes, emphasizing the importance of prompt and appropriate management strategies.

When managing patients at risk of serious bleeding, such as those with active peptic ulcers, upcoming surgeries or invasive procedures, or esophageal varices, careful consideration is required. If the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is significantly raised—typically over 2—or if fibrinogen levels are below 50 mg per deciliter, treatment involves administering one to two units of platelets per 10 kg body weight daily and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) as needed based on clotting factor levels.

Heparin use in this context is controversial. There's no evidence supporting its effectiveness once Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) has developed or in preventing its progression due to massive thrombosis. Heparin may only be indicated for chronic compensated DIC. In acute DIC, antithrombin levels should be near normal to ensure the formation of a heparin-antithrombin complex necessary to inhibit thrombin and factor Xa. If used, it's administered as a continuous infusion at 500 units per hour without an initial bolus, aiming for a Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) of about 45 seconds.

Other management options include protein C concentrate, particularly for patients with homozygous or acquired deficiencies like meningococcal septicemia with purpura fulminans. Using Fresh Frozen Plasma is not advisable due to its short half-life. Antithrombin use has shown no benefit and an increased bleeding risk when combined with heparin in sepsis-associated DIC, based on a randomized controlled trial. Recombinant human factor VIIa lacks sufficient data for routine use but has been successfully used in some desperate cases.
