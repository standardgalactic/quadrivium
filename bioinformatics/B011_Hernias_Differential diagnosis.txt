In this last lecture on hernias we're going to look at the differential diagnosis.
Now not all lumps are hernias. In the midline, in the groin, other areas where you suspect a hernia
to be, not all lumps in these areas are hernias. You've certainly got to consider the following list.
Lipomas, lymphadenitis or lymphadenopathy, large lymph nodes in the groin can feel like
a hernia. Now an abscess in the groin can look like a hernia. Beware though the
Bombay gas abscess and that what that referred to as something that looked like an abscess
but was actually necrotic bowel obstructed and incarcerated and strangulated inside a femoral
hernia. So don't get those two confused. Now hematomas and seromas after trauma for instance,
cysts and aneurysms. Aneurysm of the femoral vessels can look like a femoral hernia.
Listen for bruise. Pulpate these things. Get imaging. It's not pleasant to land inside of
an aneurysm when you think that it is a hernia. As far as the inguinal canal is concerned in
male patients always consider varicocele or hydrocele. Torsion of the testes,
torsion of the epididymis and epididymitis. Certainly a long list of differential diagnosis
to remember in cases of a hernia.
