The text discusses the Scalci-Euler equation, which is a type of higher-order linear differential equation with non-constant variable coefficients. These equations are special because they allow for explicit solutions in terms of polynomial or transcendental functions (such as trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential functions). This chapter focuses on such equations where the power of the independent variable \( x \) matches the order of differentiation.

The text introduces solving a second-order homogeneous Euler equation by assuming a solution of the form \( y = x^m \). By applying the power rule from calculus to find derivatives and substituting them back into the equation, the goal is to simplify it to solve for \( m \).

Specifically, when dealing with an equation involving terms like \( ax^n y^{(n)} + bx^{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \ldots + cy = 0 \), the text highlights that each term's power of \( x \) matches its corresponding derivative order. The solution approach involves substituting \( y = x^m \) and simplifying, leading to a characteristic equation in terms of \( m \).

The discussion includes limiting the domain of \( x \) from 0 to positive infinity for practical solving using this method. This technique is presented as an alternative to more complex methods like variation of parameters. The text emphasizes that assuming \( y = x^m \) provides legitimate solutions and simplifies the problem significantly.

The text describes solving a second-order polynomial function, often referred to as the "auxiliary equation," which arises when dealing with differential equations. Depending on the nature of its roots, there are three possible types of solutions:

1. **Real and Distinct Roots**: If the auxiliary equation has two distinct real roots \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), the solution to the differential equation is of the form:
   \[
   y(x) = c_1 x^{m_1} + c_2 x^{m_2}
   \]
   where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants.

2. **Real and Equal Roots**: If the auxiliary equation has a repeated real root (\( m_1 = m_2 = m \)), the solution takes the form:
   \[
   y(x) = (c_1 + c_2 \ln x) x^m
   \]
   Here, \( \ln x \) is introduced due to the repetition of the root.

3. **Complex Roots**: If the roots are complex, say \( m_{1,2} = \alpha \pm \beta i \), then the solution involves trigonometric functions:
   \[
   y(x) = x^\alpha (c_1 \cos(\beta \ln x) + c_2 \sin(\beta \ln x))
   \]
   This form uses Euler's formula to handle complex exponentials.

Each type of root leads to a distinct solution structure for the differential equation.
