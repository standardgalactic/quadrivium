The text discusses the Scalci-Euler equation, which is a type of higher-order linear differential equation with non-constant variable coefficients. These equations are special because they allow for explicit solutions in terms of polynomial or transcendental functions (such as trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential functions). This chapter focuses on such equations where the power of the independent variable \( x \) matches the order of differentiation.

The text introduces solving a second-order homogeneous Euler equation by assuming a solution of the form \( y = x^m \). By applying the power rule from calculus to find derivatives and substituting them back into the equation, the goal is to simplify it to solve for \( m \).

Specifically, when dealing with an equation involving terms like \( ax^n y^{(n)} + bx^{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \ldots + cy = 0 \), the text highlights that each term's power of \( x \) matches its corresponding derivative order. The solution approach involves substituting \( y = x^m \) and simplifying, leading to a characteristic equation in terms of \( m \).

The discussion includes limiting the domain of \( x \) from 0 to positive infinity for practical solving using this method. This technique is presented as an alternative to more complex methods like variation of parameters. The text emphasizes that assuming \( y = x^m \) provides legitimate solutions and simplifies the problem significantly.

The text describes solving a second-order polynomial function, often referred to as the "auxiliary equation," which arises when dealing with differential equations. Depending on the nature of its roots, there are three possible types of solutions:

1. **Real and Distinct Roots**: If the auxiliary equation has two distinct real roots \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), the solution to the differential equation is of the form:
   \[
   y(x) = c_1 x^{m_1} + c_2 x^{m_2}
   \]
   where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants.

2. **Real and Equal Roots**: If the auxiliary equation has a repeated real root (\( m_1 = m_2 = m \)), the solution takes the form:
   \[
   y(x) = (c_1 + c_2 \ln x) x^m
   \]
   Here, \( \ln x \) is introduced due to the repetition of the root.

3. **Complex Roots**: If the roots are complex, say \( m_{1,2} = \alpha \pm \beta i \), then the solution involves trigonometric functions:
   \[
   y(x) = x^\alpha (c_1 \cos(\beta \ln x) + c_2 \sin(\beta \ln x))
   \]
   This form uses Euler's formula to handle complex exponentials.

Each type of root leads to a distinct solution structure for the differential equation.

The text introduces and explains the Scalci-Euler equation, which is a type of higher-order linear differential equation with non-constant variable coefficients. The focus here is on equations that can be solved explicitly for \( y \) using either polynomial or transcendental functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential functions.

The text describes how these equations are characterized by the power of the independent variable \( x \) matching the order of differentiation. For instance, if you have a second derivative of \( y \), it is associated with \( x^2 \); for the first derivative, it’s \( x^1 \); and for no derivative (just \( y \)), it's \( x^0 \).

The section specifically addresses solving the homogeneous form of this equation. It suggests using a solution method where \( y = x^m \), leveraging calculus techniques like the power rule to find derivatives.

To solve the equation, substitute \( y = x^m \) into the original differential equation and simplify. This process involves taking derivatives, substituting back into the equation, and factoring out common terms. The solution is constrained to the domain of \( x \) from 0 to positive infinity. The approach aims at finding solutions that are powers of \( x \), simplifying the process significantly compared to other methods like variation of parameters.

The text describes solving a second-order polynomial function, referred to as the auxiliary equation. This process results in three types of roots:

1. **Real and Distinct Roots (m₁ and m₂):**  
   The solution form is \( x^{m_1} \) and \( x^{m_2} \).

2. **Repeated Real Root (m₁ = m₂):**  
   The solution includes a term \( x^{m_1} \ln(x) \).

3. **Complex Roots:**  
   If the roots are complex, expressed as \( \alpha \pm \beta i \), the solution is:  
   \[
   x^{\alpha} (c_1 \cos(\beta \ln(x)) + c_2 \sin(\beta \ln(x)))
   \]

These solutions apply to differential equations and involve using logarithms for repeated or complex roots.
