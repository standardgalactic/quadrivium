The text provides a summary of several fundamental rules for definite integration:

1. **Order of Integration**: Changing the limits of integration reverses the sign of the integral's value.
   
2. **Zero Width Interval**: An integral where both limits are identical (e.g., from A to A) is zero, as there is no area under the curve.

3. **Constant Multiple Rule**: A constant factor can be moved outside and in front of an integral.

4. **Sum and Difference Rule**: The integral of a sum or difference of functions equals the sum or difference of their individual integrals.

5. **Additivity Rule**: For consecutive intervals (A to B, then B to C), integrating over A to C is equivalent to adding the integrals from A to B and B to C for the same function.

6. **Domination Rule**: If one function is always greater than or equal to another on an interval, its integral over that range will also be greater than or equal to the other's.

7. **Maximum and Minimum Inequalities**: The definite integral from A to B is bounded by multiplying the minimum value of the function in [A, B] by the interval length and similarly for the maximum value.

An example using \(\sqrt{1 + \cos(x)}\) on the interval from 0 to 1 demonstrates these rules. It shows that the actual integral can be estimated within bounds determined by rectangles formed with the minimum and maximum function values over the interval.
