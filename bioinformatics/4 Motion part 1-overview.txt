Let's break down the process of calculating the arc length of a curve defined by a position vector \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\) over an interval from \(t=a\) to \(t=b\). The steps involve finding the velocity vector, squaring its components, summing them, and integrating the square root of that sum.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Position Vector**:  
   Given a position vector \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\).

2. **Velocity Vector**:  
   Compute the derivative of the position vector with respect to \(t\) to get the velocity vector:
   \[
   \mathbf{v}(t) = \left( \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt} \right)
   \]

3. **Magnitude of Velocity (Speed)**:  
   The speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector:
   \[
   v(t) = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2}
   \]

4. **Arc Length**:  
   The arc length \(L\) from \(t=a\) to \(t=b\) is given by the integral of the speed:
   \[
   L = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt = \int_a^b \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
   \]

### Example

Let's consider an example where:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (2t, \ln(t), t^2)
\]
and we want to find the arc length from \(t=1\) to \(t=e\).

1. **Velocity Vector**:
   \[
   \mathbf{v}(t) = \left( \frac{d}{dt}(2t), \frac{d}{dt}(\ln(t)), \frac{d}{dt}(t^2) \right) = (2, \frac{1}{t}, 2t)
   \]

2. **Magnitude of Velocity**:
   \[
   v(t) = \sqrt{2^2 + \left(\frac{1}{t}\right)^2 + (2t)^2} = \sqrt{4 + \frac{1}{t^2} + 4t^2}
   \]

3. **Arc Length**:
   The arc length is:
   \[
   L = \int_1^e \sqrt{4 + \frac{1}{t^2} + 4t^2} \, dt
   \]

### Simplification and Integration

To simplify the integrand:
\[
\sqrt{4 + \frac{1}{t^2} + 4t^2}
\]
Find a common denominator inside the square root:
\[
= \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 1 + 4t^4}{t^2}}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
= \frac{\sqrt{4t^4 + 4t^2 + 1}}{t}
\]

Recognize that \(4t^4 + 4t^2 + 1\) can be rewritten as a perfect square:
\[
= \frac{\sqrt{(2t^2 + 1)^2}}{t} = \frac{2t^2 + 1}{t}
\]
Thus, the integrand simplifies to:
\[
v(t) = 2t + \frac{1}{t}
\]

Now, integrate:
\[
L = \int_1^e \left(2t + \frac{1}{t}\right) \, dt
\]

Calculate the integral:
\[
= \left[ t^2 + \ln|t| \right]_1^e
\]
\[
= (e^2 + \ln(e)) - (1^2 + \ln(1))
\]
\[
= e^2 + 1 - 1 = e^2
\]

Thus, the arc length \(L\) from \(t=1\) to \(t=e\) is \(e^2\).

The text describes a mathematical process involving integration and simplification. It begins with an expression \(2t^2 + 1\), which is squared but then square-rooted, leading to a simplified integrand of \(\frac{2t}{1}\) or simply \(2t\). The author notes that this simplification allows for easier integration using SimPy, resulting in the definite integral answer \(e^2\).

The text emphasizes understanding the algebraic manipulation involved rather than relying solely on computational tools like SimPy. It suggests taking a moment to comprehend how the integrand was simplified before moving forward.

Looking ahead, the author plans to explore calculating position and velocity from given acceleration. This involves using antiderivatives (integrals) to reverse-engineer the process of deriving velocity from position and then acceleration. The upcoming discussion will focus on applying definite integrals to solve such problems.
