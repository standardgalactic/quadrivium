Good, let's do this. We've got to write, in shorthand, the electron orbits of these neutral atoms.
We can start with a single electron, hydrogen.
So, here's our possibilities. N equals 1, L equals 0, that's what we're going to start with.
It can take 2 electrons, because if I put in 0 there, I'm left with 2.
So I can put 2 electrons in there, I only have 1 electron, what am I going to write?
In shorthand, I'm going to write in 1, because we're in the K-shell.
For L equals 0, I'm going to write S, and I have a single electron there.
This is neutral atoms in the ground state.
So, if I wrote hydrogen, and I wrote 2P1, certainly the electron can be in that orbit,
but it will not, it will be in an excited state.
It will not be in the ground state.
So, we're writing neutral atoms in the ground state.
So, anything other than that, and I can't write 1 is 2, because if there's 2, that means there's 2 electrons.
So, I've got to write 1.
So, if I write something like 2P1, as I said, that means the electron is up on this scale at a higher energy.
That atom is in an excited state, but we want the ground state here.
Now, for helium, helium is going to be easy, 1 is 2, because this can take 2 electrons, by my expression name, and I need 2.
Now, we said the maximum that it can take, this sub-shell, is 2.
I can't put a third electron in there.
I can't have 1 is 3.
So, for lithium, I've got to put my 2 in there, which is maximum.
Now, I've got to jump 1 higher.
So, now I'm going to have a 2s, I'm going to have a 2s, and I'm putting my 1 electron in there.
How many can it take?
Well, L equals 0, so still I can put 2 in there.
So, if we go to, what did I leave out?
Oh, beryllium.
Sorry.
4 electrons in beryllium.
So, that'll be a 1s2 and 2s2 for beryllium.
But now, I've exhausted all, by the power exclusion principle, I've exhausted all these orbits.
So, if I now go to boron, I've got to have a 1s2, 2s2, and I've got to put one more electron, because I need 5.
I've got 2, 4, I need another one.
I've got to go here, which will be 2p.
2p, and I put 1 in there.
2p, 1 in there.
How many can this subshell take?
The 2p subshell.
L equals 1.
2 plus 1 is 3.
3 times 2, I can put up to 6 in there.
So, now this becomes easy.
1s2, 2s2, 2p.
Now, I've got 2, 2 for 6, 6 for carbon.
I can do 1s2, 2s2, 2p3.
1s2, 2s2, 2p4.
And 1s2, 2s2, 2p5.
And we get to neon with 10 electrons, which will be 1s2, 2s2, 2p6.
That's the maximum I can take.
If I now go to sodium, with 11 electrons, sodium, I've got to do, I've got to go, I'm full up now.
Now, I've got to go to 3s.
So, I've got to add a 3s1, the 3s1 there.
I've got to add a 3s1.
Now, this is beautiful because way before powering came the periodic table.
And the periodic table had its different columns.
And in the middle, these transitional elements, the menthanites and the ectanites.
But it was done because these columns, everything that fell into the same column, had the same chemical properties.
And Mendeleev did not know about all of this.
But look how beautiful this explains the periodic table.
Because if I look at helium, the outermost subshell, 1s2, it is full.
And that is why helium is a noble gas.
And it doesn't react to anything.
It's outer shell.
Outermost shell is full.
So, the outer shell will always be this last, the last one.
Now, helium is full.
Hydrogen is not full.
We can take that electron away.
And we can take that electron away.
And that leaves this subshell empty.
And that's a very low energy state.
Now, we go down to, for instance, neon.
This outer shell, 2p6, is absolutely full.
No electron can be added there.
It's sitting nice and comfortable.
It doesn't want to react to anything.
So, we have the full shell there.
Now, again, we jump to sodium.
The outer shell has got that one electron in there.
If it gets rid of that electron, that means it's new outer shell, which will be 2p6.
It's now nice and comfortable.
It wants to be in that state.
So, this beautifully explained, long after writing the periodic table, this beautifully explains the periodic table.
Let's see if we can answer these three questions.
We have to write the ground state orbits of krypton 36.
Now, how do we do that?
Let's just use our memorized table here.
Let's see how many, what is the maximum number of electrons it can take?
0, putting in 0 in here is going to give us, that can take a maximum of 2.
That can take a maximum of 2.
p is going to be a maximum of 6, because if I put 1 in there, 2 times 1 is 2, plus 1 is 3, times 2 is 6.
We said, s, we said, can take 2.
We have another p with 1, that is 6.
We have another s, which is 2.
Now, we get to d.
2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is 5, times 2, it can take 10.
I'm back with p, p equals 1, remember, p is 1, I should say, and p can take 6, s can take 2,
and we're back to a d that can take 10.
So we need to write krypton 36.
So we've just got to add up these until we get to 36.
2 times 2 is 4, plus 6 is 10.
11, 12, 18, 20, 30, 6.
So that was a 35, we would have written p5 in the end.
So I've got to write it up till there.
And I've got my shell numbers here.
So that would be 1.
So that's going to be a 1s2, a 2s2, a 2p6, a 3s2, a 3p6, a 4s2, 4s2.
This comes from 3, remember, so that would be a 3d10.
I'm just going to keep on writing here, 3d10.
And this comes from 4, so that would be a 4p6.
And that's as simple as that.
So I had no space there, but you just carry on writing there.
Easy to do.
Now, can a 5g subshell hold 22 electrons?
What is g?
g is 4.
If I plug in 4 there, 4 times 2, 8 plus 1 is 9.
9 times 2 is 18.
It cannot hold 22 electrons.
Easy.
Is this manganese atomic number z equals 25, is that in the ground state?
All I have to do is read things up here.
1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6, 4s2, 3d4, and now suddenly 4p1.
So we didn't fill this up before we went to the next one.
So certainly there's some empty gaps there that could have been filled to make it in the ground state.
So no, this manganese is not in the ground state.
It is in an excited state.
