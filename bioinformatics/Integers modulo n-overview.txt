The text provides an introduction to the concept of integers modulo \( n \) (\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)), explaining how these form a group under addition. The discussion starts with basic division and remainders, using simple examples like dividing 4 by 4 or -1 by 4, showing that remainders are always non-negative.

The key idea is understanding remainders when dividing integers by \( n \). For instance, when dividing numbers from 0 to 7 by 4, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, and 3. This pattern repeats cyclically for all integers, whether positive or negative (e.g., -1 divided by 4 has a remainder of 3).

The text then transitions into defining a relation in terms of modular arithmetic. Given a set \( S \) of all integers and choosing an integer \( n > 0 \), the relation \( R \) is described as follows: two integers \( a \) and \( b \) are related if their difference \( a - b \) is divisible by \( n \). This means that when \( a-b \) is divided by \( n \), there is no remainder, effectively grouping numbers into equivalence classes based on shared remainders.

The text emphasizes modular arithmetic's role in forming groups and sets the stage for further exploration of these mathematical structures.

The text discusses a mathematical concept regarding divisibility and explores whether certain properties hold for a specific relation. The main focus is on the statement "n divides \(a - b\) for all integers \(a, b\)" where \(n\) is any non-zero integer.

1. **Correctness of Divisibility:**
   - It begins by confirming that 4 divides 12 because dividing 12 by 4 results in an integer (3) with a remainder of 0.
   - Conversely, 4 does not divide 11 since there's a non-zero remainder when divided.

2. **Expression Explanation:**
   - The text explains \(a - b\) as the difference between two numbers, like 12 minus 8 equals 4, where 4 divides itself (since 4/4 = 1 with no remainder).

3. **Exploration of Properties:**
   - **Reflexive Property:** This property holds because for any integer \(a\), \(n\) divides \(a-a\) (which is 0). Since any non-zero integer divides 0, the relation is reflexive.
   
   - **Symmetric Property:** The text confirms symmetry by noting that if \(n\) divides \(a-b\), then it also divides \(b-a\). This is because \(a-b = -(b-a)\) and division by \(n\) remains valid for both expressions.

   - **Transitive Property:** Transitivity is discussed with examples. If \(n\) divides both \(a-b\) and \(b-c\), then it should divide \((a-b)+(b-c) = a-c\). This holds as demonstrated with specific numbers (e.g., if 4 divides both 8 and 4, it must divide their sum, 12).

In conclusion, the relation "n divides \(a - b\) for all integers" is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, making it an equivalence relation.

The text discusses the mathematical concept related to divisibility and provides an illustration using specific numbers. Here's a summary:

1. **Concept Introduction**: The speaker aims to show that if \( n \) divides both \( (a - b) \) and \( (b - c) \), then it must also divide \( (a - c) \).

2. **Example with Numbers**:
   - They use specific numbers: \( a = 12 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = 4 \).
   - Calculate \( (a - b) = 4 \) and \( (b - c) = 4 \). Since both results are divisible by 4, it implies that \( n = 4 \).

3. **Mathematical Explanation**:
   - By adding the equations: 
     \[
     (a - b) + (b - c) = a - c
     \]
   - This shows \( n \) divides \( (a - c) \), which is 8 in this example.

4. **Generalization with Multiples**:
   - They express the numbers as multiples of \( n \): 
     \[
     a - b = pn, \quad b - c = qn
     \]
   - Adding these gives:
     \[
     (a - b) + (b - c) = (p + q)n = a - c
     \]
   - This confirms that \( n \) divides \( (a - c) \).

5. **Conclusion**: The explanation demonstrates the transitive property of divisibility, showing that if a number \( n \) divides two differences, it also divides their resultant difference.

The text discusses the concept of an equivalence relation in mathematics, characterized by three properties: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. An equivalence relation partitions a set into disjoint subsets called equivalence classes. Each class groups elements that are equivalent to each other under this relation, and any two different equivalence classes have no common elements (their intersection is the empty set).

The example provided illustrates equivalence classes using integers modulo 4, which divides numbers based on their remainder when divided by 4. The equivalence classes for integers mod 4 are:

1. **Class [0]**: Includes all integers that leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 4, such as -12, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, and 12.
2. **Class [1]**: Includes integers with a remainder of 1, like -7, -3, 1, 5, 9, and 13.
3. **Class [2]**: Contains integers that leave a remainder of 2, such as -10, -6, 2, 6, and 10.
4. **Class [3]**: Consists of integers with a remainder of 3, including -11, -7, -3, 3, 7, and 11.

These classes partition the set of all integers into distinct groups where no two different classes share any elements, demonstrating the principle that equivalence classes under an equivalence relation are disjoint.

The text discusses forming equivalence classes under a specific relation defined on integers, focusing on division by four. The process involves repeatedly subtracting numbers and examining remainders when divided by twelve or four. This leads to establishing that the difference between any two numbers in an equivalence class is divisible by four, indicating reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity properties of the relation.

These classes are constructed for each remainder when dividing integers by four: zero, one, two, and three. For example, if you start with a number like eight, subtracting four results in four, which is divisible by four, confirming the equivalence. The text lists sequences like minus nine plus three resulting in minus six, and similar calculations show that the differences are multiples of four.

The conclusion is that these form equivalence classes under the relation defined modulo four. The set of interest here, denoted as "A" when \( N = 4 \), starts with zero and continues based on this modular arithmetic rule. Thus, any two numbers selected from an equivalence class will have a difference divisible by four, demonstrating their membership in the same class. This structure is referred to as integers modulo four or \(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\).

The text discusses the concept of equivalence classes and their application in forming a group under addition. Here's a summary:

1. **Equivalence Classes**: The text starts by mentioning four equivalence classes derived from the set \( N \) (the natural numbers), where each class is defined by divisibility by 4.

2. **Set Construction**: A new set, denoted as \( S \), is constructed with these four elements: 0, 1, 2, and 3. This set represents the equivalence classes modulo 4.

3. **Binary Operation - Addition**: The text explores whether this set \( S \) forms a group under addition. It describes performing addition within this set by selecting any two elements and adding them.

4. **Addition Definition**: To define addition, representatives from each class are used. For example, adding two elements both equivalent to 1 modulo 4 (i.e., \( S_1 + S_1 \)) results in an element equivalent to 0 modulo 4.

5. **Group Properties Check**: The text implies checking if the set \( S \) with addition satisfies group properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.

Overall, the goal is to determine if the set of equivalence classes under addition forms a mathematical group.

The text describes a process involving equivalence classes and addition within a set of four elements. The speaker is working with these equivalence classes, using representatives for calculation purposes.

Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Equivalence Classes**: The speaker identifies equivalence classes within a system consisting of four elements (0, 1, 2, 3) and performs operations on them.
   
2. **Addition Operation**: Addition is defined by selecting representatives from these equivalence classes. For example, when adding 1 to any element, the result must be adjusted back into the set using modular arithmetic.

3. **Examples Provided**:
   - Adding different numbers (like 0+0 and 4+8) results in a new number that corresponds to an equivalence class.
   - The addition of numbers is demonstrated with examples such as zero plus zero equals zero, and four plus eight, which equates to twelve but remains in the context of its equivalence class (i.e., modulo operation).

Overall, the text illustrates how arithmetic operations can be defined within a constrained set using modular arithmetic concepts.

The text describes properties of addition within an equivalence class system, specifically focusing on how adding zero functions as the identity element. The core point illustrated is that adding zero to any number or vice versa results in the same number, confirming zero's role as the identity element.

It then explores the behavior of numbers when added together by using examples within different equivalence classes. For instance:
- Adding one to itself gives two, which belongs to equivalence class two.
- Adding one repeatedly leads to progression through equivalence classes: two plus one is three (class three), and three plus one is four (class zero).

The text further demonstrates addition across various numbers:
- One plus two results in eleven, belonging to equivalence class three.
- Two plus two equals four, returning to class zero.
- Three plus two equals five, leading to class one.

Finally, it concludes by showing consistent results within these classes when combining different numbers, reinforcing that regardless of the specific values added (like 5+6 or 7+6), they ultimately fall into a predictable equivalence class. This illustrates how addition operates consistently across this structured system of classes.

The text explores a mathematical concept involving addition on a specific set of integers: \(-2\), \(1\), \(3\), and \(7\). It discusses checking whether this set forms a group under addition, focusing on key properties:

1. **Closure**: The operation is closed, meaning any sum of two elements from the set results in another element within the same set.

2. **Associativity**: Although not proven here, it suggests verifying associativity by selecting specific elements and confirming that \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\).

3. **Identity Element**: The identity element is \(0\), as adding zero to any element returns the same element.

4. **Inverses**: Each element has an inverse within the set:
   - The inverse of \(0\) is itself.
   - The inverse of \(1\) is \(3\).
   - The inverse of \(2\) is itself.
   - The inverse of \(3\) is \(1\).

The text concludes that these properties confirm the set forms a group under addition.

The text discusses the algebraic structure of integers modulo \(n\) (\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)). It explains that when considering addition as the operation, the set of integers modulo \(n\) forms a group. A group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set equipped with an operation that satisfies certain properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.

The text suggests experimenting with multiplication to see how it behaves in this context. Specifically, it points out that when using multiplication as the operation on integers modulo \(n\), they do not form a group. This is because one of the necessary group propertiesâ€”having an inverse for every elementâ€”is generally not satisfied under multiplication for \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\).

To illustrate, it notes that there are typically only two elements in \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) (namely 1 and -1 or their equivalents) which have multiplicative inverses. This example underscores why multiplication does not form a group under these conditions.

The text encourages exploring these properties on your own to understand the differences between additive and multiplicative structures in modular arithmetic.

The text introduces the concept of integers modulo \( n \), focusing on how remainders work when dividing numbers. Here is a summary:

1. **Division and Remainders**: The discussion begins with basic examples of division, emphasizing the importance of understanding remainders. For instance:
   - 4 divided by 4 has no remainder.
   - As numbers increase (e.g., 5 to 7), their remainders when divided by 4 range from 1 to 3.
   - This pattern repeats every four numbers.

2. **Negative Numbers**: The text explains how to handle negative numbers, using the same concept of remainders but requiring an adjustment to ensure the remainder is positive:
   - For example, \(-1\) divided by \(4\) leaves a remainder of \(3\), since you overshoot and need to add back.

3. **Remainder Patterns**: The integers mod \( n \) (in this case, 4) have repeating remainders: 0, 1, 2, and 3. This pattern is consistent for both positive and negative numbers.

4. **Relation and Set Definition**:
   - A set \( S \) of all integers is defined.
   - An integer \( n \), which cannot be zero (to avoid division by zero), is chosen to divide elements in \( S \).
   - A relation \( R \) is introduced, where two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) from the set are related if their difference (\(a-b\)) is divisible by \( n \).

5. **Divisibility**: The text concludes with an explanation of divisibility: when \( n \) divides \( (a-b) \), it means dividing \( (a-b) \) by \( n \) leaves no remainder, indicating a complete division.

Overall, the discussion provides foundational knowledge about modular arithmetic and sets up for more advanced topics like group theory, where these concepts are applied.

The text discusses a mathematical relation concerning divisibility, specifically focusing on whether an integer \( n \) divides the difference between any two integers \( a \) and \( b \), denoted as \( n \mid (a - b) \). The text examines this relation under three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

1. **Reflexivity**: A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. Here, it's shown that \( n \mid (a - a) \) for any integer \( a \), since \( a - a = 0 \) and any non-zero integer divides zero. Thus, the relation is reflexive.

2. **Symmetry**: A relation is symmetric if whenever \( n \mid (a - b) \), it also holds that \( n \mid (b - a) \). Since \( a - b = -(b - a) \), divisibility by \( n \) of one implies divisibility by \( n \) of the other. Therefore, the relation is symmetric.

3. **Transitivity**: A relation is transitive if whenever \( n \mid (a - b) \) and \( n \mid (b - c) \), it follows that \( n \mid (a - c) \). The text suggests that if \( n \) divides both \( a - b \) and \( b - c \), then it must divide their sum, \( (a - b) + (b - c) = a - c \). Thus, the relation is transitive.

The discussion concludes that since the divisibility relation satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, it qualifies as an equivalence relation.

The text explains how the properties of divisibility can be demonstrated using simple arithmetic examples and logical reasoning. It starts by setting up a scenario where \( n \) divides both \( a - b \) and \( b - c \). From this, it concludes that \( n \) also divides \( a - c \), showing the transitive property in action.

An example is provided using specific numbers: if 12 minus 8 (i.e., \( a - b \)) and 8 minus 4 (i.e., \( b - c \)) are divisible by \( d = 4 \), then adding these results together shows that 12 minus 4 (i.e., \( a - c \)) is also divisible by 4. The text illustrates this concept further by expressing the differences as multiples of \( n \) (or \( d \)), showing how combining them retains divisibility.

In summary, if \( n \) divides both \( a - b \) and \( b - c \), then it must divide \( a - c \). This demonstration uses arithmetic examples to illustrate the transitive property of divisibility.

The text discusses the concept of an equivalence relation in mathematics, which is defined by three properties: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. When a relation satisfies these properties on a set, it divides that set into distinct subsets called equivalence classes. These equivalence classes have no intersection with each other except for the empty set.

An example provided is the integers modulo 4. Here, numbers are divided into equivalence classes based on their remainder when divided by 4:

1. The equivalence class of zero includes numbers like -12, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, 12, etc., which all have a remainder of zero.
2. The equivalence class for a remainder of one includes numbers like -7, -3, 1, 5, 9, 13, etc.
3. Similar equivalence classes can be formed for remainders two and three.

Each class contains numbers that share the same remainder when divided by 4, illustrating how the set of integers is partitioned into these distinct groups or equivalence classes.

The text describes an exploration of equivalence classes within modular arithmetic, specifically mod 4. It demonstrates how numbers can be grouped into sets (equivalence classes) based on their remainders when divided by 4. The process involves showing that a relation (subtracting two numbers and checking if the result is divisible by 4) has reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties, thus forming equivalence classes.

Examples are provided to illustrate this: subtracting pairs of numbers like 8-4, 9-5, etc., results in differences that are divisible by 4. This confirms the relation holds for these cases, establishing equivalence classes such as {â€¦, -12, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, â€¦}, which can be generalized to any integer set where the difference is a multiple of 4.

The text concludes by identifying these sets as the integers mod 4 and mentions constructing similar sets for other values of \( N \), such as \( N = 4 \), leading to specific equivalence classes like {0}. This modular arithmetic framework is crucial in number theory and various applications where divisibility and remainders are key.

The text discusses the concept of equivalence classes and their use in defining a set with four elements, \( S = \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \), under addition modulo 4. This is derived from considering integers divided by 12, but focusing only on those that leave remainders between 0 and 3 when divided by 4.

The main goal is to determine if the set \( S \) forms a group under addition modulo 4. A group must satisfy four criteria: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. Here's how these are addressed:

1. **Closure**: For any two elements in \( S \), their sum modulo 4 is also an element of \( S \).

2. **Associativity**: Addition modulo 4 is associative.

3. **Identity Element**: The number 0 acts as the identity element because adding 0 to any element in \( S \) leaves it unchanged.

4. **Invertibility**: Each element has an inverse such that their sum modulo 4 equals the identity element (0). For example, the inverse of 1 is 3, since \( 1 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \).

By confirming these properties, the text establishes that \( S = \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \) under addition modulo 4 forms a group.

The text discusses addition within an equivalence class of numbers modulo 4. The speaker explains how to perform addition by selecting representatives from each equivalence class (0, 1, 2, 3) and then performing operations based on these representatives.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

- Addition is defined using a representative number from each equivalence class.
- For example, adding one to any number results in moving to the next equivalence class. 
- The classes are:  
  - \(0 \equiv 4 \equiv 8 \equiv ...\)
  - \(1 \equiv 5 \equiv 9 \equiv ...\)
  - \(2 \equiv 6 \equiv 10 \equiv ...\)
  - \(3 \equiv 7 \equiv 11 \equiv ...\)

Examples:
- Adding two numbers like 4 and 8, which are both equivalent to 0, results in 12. Since 12 is also equivalent to 0 (because 12 mod 4 = 0), the result remains in class 0.
- When adding one to zero, you get one.

The speaker uses this modular arithmetic concept to simplify calculations by focusing on equivalence classes rather than individual numbers within those classes.

The text explains the concept of an identity element, specifically focusing on addition with respect to "equivalence classes." Zero is identified as the identity element because adding zero to any number or vice versa does not change that number. It provides examples illustrating how numbers are grouped into equivalence classes based on their remainders when divided by four.

Here's a summary:

1. **Identity Element**: Zero is identified as the identity element for addition, meaning any number plus zero remains unchanged.

2. **Equivalence Classes**: The text discusses operations within equivalence classes of integers modulo 4:
   - Numbers are categorized into classes based on their remainders (0 through 3) when divided by 4.
   - Examples illustrate how adding numbers affects which class they belong to.

3. **Examples**:
   - Adding one repeatedly shows transitions between classes: \(1+1=2\), \(2+1=3\), \(3+1=4\) (which is 0 modulo 4).
   - Other examples include \(1+2=11\) which is in class 3, and \(2+2=4\) which returns to class 0.
   - Operations consistently result in numbers belonging to one of the four classes based on their remainder when divided by 4.

The text illustrates how arithmetic operations respect these equivalence classes under modulo 4 addition.

The text describes an operation defined on a set with four elements: equivalence classes represented by integers. The elements considered are -2, 1, 3, and 7. Addition is performed modulo some number (implied to be 6 based on the example calculations). Here's a summary of the key points:

- **Closure**: The operation is closed under addition; adding any two elements results in another element within the set.

- **Associativity**: Although not proven here, the text suggests checking that associativity holds for these operations.

- **Identity Element**: The identity element for this operation is 0 (or its equivalence class), as adding it to any element returns the same element.

- **Inverses**: Each element has an inverse within the set:
  - 0 is its own inverse.
  - 1's inverse is 3, and vice versa.
  - 2 is its own inverse.
  
These properties confirm that the structure forms a group under addition modulo 6. The text humorously concludes by stating "Lo and behold. I have a group," implying satisfaction with identifying this mathematical structure among integers.

The text discusses the properties of integers under addition and multiplication in modular arithmetic, specifically modulo \(n\). It highlights that when considering integers modulo \(n\) (such as integers mod 4 or any other number), they form a group under addition. This means they satisfy all group properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.

However, the same set of integers does not form a group under multiplication. The text encourages exploring these concepts independently to see which properties hold for each operation. In summary, while integers modulo \(n\) create a structured group with addition, this structure is absent when considering multiplication.
