The text outlines a method for solving the exact differential equation \( 2xy \, dx + (x^2 - 1) \, dy = 0 \). Hereâ€™s a summary of the key steps:

1. **Exactness Verification:**
   - The equation is confirmed to be exact by checking if:
     \[
     \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x},
     \]
     where \( M(x, y) = 2xy \) and \( N(x, y) = x^2 - 1 \).
   - Both partial derivatives are \( 2x \), confirming exactness.

2. **Finding the Potential Function:**
   - Integrate \( M \) with respect to \( x \):
     \[
     f(x, y) = \int 2xy \, dx = x^2y + g(y),
     \]
     where \( g(y) \) is a function of \( y \).

3. **Determining \( g(y) \):**
   - Use \( N = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \):
     \[
     x^2 + g'(y) = x^2 - 1.
     \]
   - Solve for \( g'(y) \):
     \[
     g'(y) = -1.
     \]
   - Integrate to find:
     \[
     g(y) = -y + C.

4. **Formulate the Solution:**
   - The potential function is:
     \[
     f(x, y) = x^2y - y + C.
     \]
   - Set \( f(x, y) = \text{constant} \):
     \[
     x^2y - y = C_1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y(x^2 - 1) = C_1.
     \]
   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{C_1}{x^2 - 1}.
     \]

5. **Alternative Method: Separation of Variables:**
   - Rearrange and integrate:
     \[
     \ln |y| = -\ln |x^2 - 1| + C_2,
     \]
     leading to:
     \[
     y = \frac{C}{x^2 - 1},
     \]
     where \( C = e^{C_2} \).

Both methods confirm the solution for \( y \). The text also explores a related expression involving natural logarithms, ultimately reinforcing the consistency of the solution by differentiating and verifying the differential equation.
