The text discusses fundamental concepts in set theory and algebra, focusing on product sets and mappings:

1. **Product Sets**: These are pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x\) belongs to one set \(A_1\) and \(y\) to another set \(A_2\). For example, if \(A_1 = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(A_2 = \{4, 5\}\), the product set includes pairs like \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 5)\).

2. **Mappings**: These involve creating pairs from two sets, where elements of one set (domain) are related to elements of another set (codomain). For instance, in \(y = x^2\), real numbers on the x-axis map to y-values.

3. **Domain and Codomain**:
   - The domain is the set of all possible input values, such as all real numbers for \(x\) in \(y = x^2\).
   - The codomain is the set of all potential output values.
   - The range consists of actual outputs; for \(y = x^2\), this includes only non-negative values (\(y \geq 0\)).

4. **Types of Mappings**:
   - **Injective (One-to-One)**: Each element in the codomain has at most one pre-image in the domain.
     - Example: A mapping where each element in set \(A_3\) is mapped by at most one element from \(A_1\).
   - **Surjective (Onto)**: Every element in the codomain has at least one pre-image in the domain.
     - Example: A mapping where every element in set \(A_3\) is reached by some element from \(A_2\).
   - **Bijection**: This type of mapping is both injective and surjective, meaning each element in the codomain is mapped by exactly one element from the domain. Bijections are significant because they have inverses.

The text uses examples with sets labeled \(A_1\), \(A_2\), and \(A_3\) to illustrate these concepts.
