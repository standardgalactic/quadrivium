The text introduces the concept of a line integral over a closed path, where the start and end points are identical. This is significant because if for any piecewise smooth, integrable closed curve \( C \) within the domain of a vector field \( f \), the line integral \(\int_C \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0\), it implies that \( f \) is a conservative (path-independent) vector field. This means there exists a potential function whose gradient is equal to \( f \).

Key points include:
- A vector field is path independent if the curl of the field (\(\nabla \times \mathbf{f}\)) is zero, indicating no rotation or circulation within the field.
- The domain must be simply connected, meaning it has no holes or excluded sections that could affect path independence.
- Checking for a potential function involves ensuring the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of \( f \) is zero, which relates to computing the curl.

Understanding these conditions and their implications allows one to apply multivariable calculus effectively in solving real-world problems.
