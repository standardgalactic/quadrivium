The text introduces the concept of a line integral over a closed path, where the start and end points are identical. This is significant because if for any piecewise smooth, integrable closed curve \( C \) within the domain of a vector field \( f \), the line integral \(\int_C \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0\), it implies that \( f \) is a conservative (path-independent) vector field. This means there exists a potential function whose gradient is equal to \( f \).

Key points include:
- A vector field is path independent if the curl of the field (\(\nabla \times \mathbf{f}\)) is zero, indicating no rotation or circulation within the field.
- The domain must be simply connected, meaning it has no holes or excluded sections that could affect path independence.
- Checking for a potential function involves ensuring the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of \( f \) is zero, which relates to computing the curl.

Understanding these conditions and their implications allows one to apply multivariable calculus effectively in solving real-world problems.

The text introduces the concept of a line integral over a closed path, emphasizing that for such an integral (denoted as \( \oint \)) the start and end points must be identical. It explains that if a continuous vector field \(\mathbf{f}\) results in a zero value when integrated around any closed curve (\(\oint \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0\)), it indicates that \(\mathbf{f}\) is conservative and path independent. This means there exists an underlying potential function for \(\mathbf{f}\), even if initially unknown.

To determine whether a vector field is conservative, one can check if the curl of \(\mathbf{f}\) is zero; this implies path independence as well. Since a conservative vector field is essentially the gradient of some scalar multivariable function, its curl will also be zero. Additionally, verifying that the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of \(\mathbf{f}\) is zero can confirm this condition.

A critical requirement for these properties to hold is that the domain of the vector field must be simply connectedâ€”meaning it contains no holes or disconnected sections that could affect path traversal. Understanding and remembering these conditions is essential when applying concepts from multivariable calculus to real-world problems, ensuring all prerequisites are met before using learned methods to solve such problems.
