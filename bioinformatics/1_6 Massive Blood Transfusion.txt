Massive blood transfusions
In this video we're going to discuss
Massive blood transfusions
In the introduction we'll define
Massive blood transfusions
We'll look at red cell and volume replacement
We'll look at alterations in the coagulation system
Which is very important
Complications of citrate infusion
And we must always remember to prevent hypothermia
Now what is massive blood transfusion?
Well it's not only that multi-trauma patient
Receives 23 units of blood in theatre
It is only the replacement
By transfusion of more than
50% of a patient's blood volume in 12 to 24 hours
That's not a lot
And remember all your hemostatic
And metabolic complications may ensue
Even after such a small
Volume of transfusion
So more than 50% of a patient's
Blood volume after 24 hours
Now we use red cells
To give volume, intravascular volume
And to maintain oxygen delivery
Remember at rest in a healthy individual
Oxygen delivery outstrips demand
Four times, you can actually drop your HP
Four times
While you can still maintain adequate oxygen delivery
So volume we can give
With crystalloids or colloids
But also with blood
I mean each unit of blood
Replaces about 200mls
Or provides about 200mls of red cells
Remember on the oxygen delivery side
That there's a reduction in 2,3 DPG
And that gives you a lower oxygen release
If your tissues are normally healthy
Within normal limits
You are going to normalize your 2,3 DPG levels
In about 6 to 4 hours
Now very important alterations in coagulation
Looking at the causes of coagulopathy and trauma
Remember there is the coagulation of trauma itself
And there is dilution by our non-blood products
Now the coagulation of trauma
This is in the setting of tissue trauma
Massive head injury
Massive muscle damage
You get acidosis, hypothermia hypoxia
Consumption of your coagulant proteins and platelets
And the fibrin also lysis
If we just look at acidosis and hypothermia
Remember acidosis interferes with the formation
Of your coagulation factor complexes
And hypothermia reduces your enzymatic activity
Of your coagulation factors
But it also prevents activation of platelets
And that's why acidosis and hypothermia
Is important
Looking at our clotting factors
Remember crystalloids, colloids, pectoid blood cells
Dilute your clotting factors and your platelets
And you can see this
This occurs by prolonged PT and APTT activity
By thrombocytopenia
By low fibrinogen levels
And by increased D-dimers
If you did your blood tests
Remember 500ml of blood loss replaced
Gives you a 10% drop in clotting factor activity
And 8-10 units of packed red blood cells
Are then going to give you a coagulation activity
Of only 25%
Now there's some retrospective data
From the Iraqi war
That does suggest that you should give packed red blood cells
FFP and plasma in a 1 to 1 to 1 ratio
And although there's no real prospective data
To support this
This is certainly the way that trauma care is leaning towards
If you do not want to be so aggressive
Remember that you should consider plasma
If the PT or APTT levels exceed about 1.5 times the control
Looking at the platelet count
Remember 10 to 12 units of packed red blood cells
Gives you about a 50% fall in platelet count
And with that 50% fall
And with that 50% fall
You're going to start seeing problems purely on the count basis
That doesn't include the effect
Say for instance of the hypothermia
This is a 50% reduction just due to that
10 to 12 units of packed red blood cells
And one unit of platelets
Is going to give you a platelet count increase
Of about 5000
So what should you monitor if a patient now receives 50% of their lost volume in 12 to 24 hours
Well you've got to look at the prothrombin time
The activated partial thromboplastin time
Platelets, HP, fibrinogen levels, potassium, ionized calcium and pH
These are the important things to look out for
That excludes obviously looking at PO2, SAO2 etc. on your gas
So what are the complications of citrate?
Remember as anti-clotting factors
The blood will contain sodium citrate and citric acid
Well first of all there's a metabolic alkalosis
Now remember you can see it in red at the bottom
The older blood gets the more potassium gets released
And there is a risk of hyperkalemia
But initially we will see a metabolic alkalosis
And the hypokalemia
How does this work?
Well pH of freshly collected blood is about 7.1
That's at 37 degrees
As it collects in the bag
If you bring the temperature down to about 1 to 6 degrees
It jumps to about 7.6
But at any rate pH falls at about 0.1 pH units per week
Now if the tissue or the liver function is intact
The citrate will be metabolized to bicarbonate
And we are going to get about 23 mEq per unit given
So if your renal function is inadequate
You are going to end up with an alkalosis
If you can't manage that excess of bicarbonate
And remember potassium is going to be exchanged for hydrogen
Because the patient is becoming alkalotic
They need hydrogen in the intravascular space
So intracellular hydrogen is going to leak out
And that's going to be exchanged for extracellular potassium
That goes intracellularly
Hence the hypokalemia
As I said just remember in old blood
Stored blood beware of the opposite of that
The hyperkalemia
Let's look at the hypocalcemia
That's also a complication of citrate
Now calcium chelates citrate
And that gives you the hypocalcemia
A patient can present with paresthesias
And in some patients who are just even cardiac arrhythmias
So what should you do?
Rule of thumb about 10 to 20 mLs of 10% calcium gluconate
Per 500 mLs of blood infused
Or about 2 to 5 mLs of 10% calcium chloride
Per 500 mLs of blood infused
Remember if a patient has abnormal liver functions
The calcium chloride is actually preferred
Lastly always remember to prevent hypothermia in these patients
Acute hypothermia is going to give you the mentioned clotting abnormalities
But can also give you arrhythmias in itself
So use appropriate warmers
