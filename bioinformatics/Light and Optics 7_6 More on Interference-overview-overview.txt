The text explains interference phenomena with a focus on Young's double-slit experiment. It covers several key points:

1. **Interference Basics**: Interference occurs when two overlapping waves are either in phase (constructive interference) or out of phase by half a wavelength (destructive interference).

2. **Coherent Light**: Coherence requires light sources to emit waves with constant phase differences and wavelengths, maintaining consistent relative positions and frequencies over time.

3. **Path Difference in Interference**:
   - Constructive interference occurs when the path difference \( L2 - L1 \) is an integer multiple of the wavelength (\( n\lambda \)).
   - Destructive interference happens when the path difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength (\( (n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda \)).

4. **Young's Double-Slit Experiment**: This setup uses two coherent light sources to create an interference pattern on a screen, characterized by alternating bright and dark fringes due to constructive and destructive interference.

5. **Example Calculations**:
   - With a wavelength of 0.1 meters, if the path difference is 0.2 meters (twice the wavelength), there is constructive interference.
   - A path difference of 0.15 meters (\(1.5 \times\) the wavelength) results in destructive interference.

6. **Square Arrangement**: When coherent sources are at opposite corners of a square and an observer is at the center, constructive interference occurs due to equal distances from each source to the center, making \( L2 - L1 = 0 \).

The explanation highlights how path differences between waves lead to various interference patterns based on coherence and wavelength.
