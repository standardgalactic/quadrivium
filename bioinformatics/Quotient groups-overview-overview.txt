The text discusses how quotient groups are constructed in abstract algebra by using a process that involves partitioning an existing group into cosets based on a normal subgroup. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Formation of Quotient Groups**: A quotient group, denoted as \( G/N \), is formed when you take a group \( G \) and a normal subgroup \( N \). The elements in this new group are the cosets of \( N \) within \( G \).

2. **Cosets as Elements**: In this context, each element of the quotient group corresponds to a coset, which can be either a left or right coset due to the property that \( N \) is normal.

3. **Binary Operation on Cosets**: The text explains how to define a binary operation for the quotient group by taking two arbitrary cosets and performing the original group's binary operation (composition), resulting in another coset within the quotient group.

4. **Associativity and Normality**: The associativity of the original group \( G \) and the normal property of the subgroup \( N \) ensure that this binary operation on the cosets is well-defined, allowing the structure of a group to be maintained in the quotient group.

Overall, the concept relies on the properties of normal subgroups and the ability to define operations on cosets such that they form a new group with consistent algebraic structure.
