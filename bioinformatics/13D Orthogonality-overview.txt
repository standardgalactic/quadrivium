The text discusses orthogonality in Euclidean spaces using the dot product as a measure. In both 2D and 3D space, two vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) are considered orthogonal if their dot product is zero (\( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \)). This concept of orthogonality extends to higher dimensions, such as 4D (\( \mathbb{R}^4 \)), 5D (\( \mathbb{R}^5 \)), and any \( n \)-dimensional space (\( \mathbb{R}^n \)). Orthogonal vectors are also described as perpendicular. The text further explains that if two vectors are orthogonal, the Pythagorean theorem applies: the squared norm of their sum equals the sum of their squared norms, i.e., \( \| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \|^2 = \| \mathbf{u} \|^2 + \| \mathbf{v} \|^2 \). This relationship holds only when the vectors are orthogonal.

The text discusses orthogonality in Euclidean space. It explains that for vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), they are considered orthogonal (or perpendicular) if their dot product equals zero: \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \). This concept is valid not only in two-dimensional (\( \mathbb{R}^2 \)) and three-dimensional (\( \mathbb{R}^3 \)) spaces but also extends to higher dimensions such as \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), \( \mathbb{R}^5 \), or any \( \mathbb{R}^n \) space.

The text further explains that if two vectors are orthogonal, the Pythagorean theorem applies. Specifically, for orthogonal vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), the norm of their sum squared equals the sum of their norms squared: 

\[
\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2
\]

This relationship holds true only when the vectors are orthogonal.
