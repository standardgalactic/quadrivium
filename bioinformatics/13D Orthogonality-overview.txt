The text discusses orthogonality in Euclidean spaces using the dot product as a measure. In both 2D and 3D space, two vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) are considered orthogonal if their dot product is zero (\( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \)). This concept of orthogonality extends to higher dimensions, such as 4D (\( \mathbb{R}^4 \)), 5D (\( \mathbb{R}^5 \)), and any \( n \)-dimensional space (\( \mathbb{R}^n \)). Orthogonal vectors are also described as perpendicular. The text further explains that if two vectors are orthogonal, the Pythagorean theorem applies: the squared norm of their sum equals the sum of their squared norms, i.e., \( \| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \|^2 = \| \mathbf{u} \|^2 + \| \mathbf{v} \|^2 \). This relationship holds only when the vectors are orthogonal.
