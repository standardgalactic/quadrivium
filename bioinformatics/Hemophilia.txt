Haemophilia A is a deficiency in factor 8 and Haemophilia B is a deficiency in factor 9.
Now most patients are well known with haemophilia by the time they present.
If not, they may present initially with a spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles, etc.
And that happens if the activity is less than 1% which we would term severe haemophilia.
Now moderate and mild cases can cause bleeding from trauma or you might notice excessive bleeding during and after surgery.
Diagnosis is made by observing a prolonged APTT, followed by specific factor analysis showing the deficiency.
And management is by administration of specific coagulation factors prior to surgery and for 7 to 10 days thereafter,
depending on the type of surgery that was performed.
