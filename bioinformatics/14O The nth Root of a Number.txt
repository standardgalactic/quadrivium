Good, let's do some more problems. We have z1, z2, and z3, being i, 1 minus the square root of 3i, and the square root of 3 plus i.
We are asked to express those in polar form, and then to calculate this expression z1, z2, divided by z3.
So, let's first of all express these as in polar form. Let's start with z1.
Let's start with z1. Okay, so first of all we need r, which is the modulus of z.
1, that's going to give us r1, which is the square root of a squared plus b squared.
a is 0, b is 1, so the square root of 0 squared plus 1 squared is just 1.
Now, we need the angle. Now, just think about it in your mind, in the complex coordinate system, where's i?
i is straight up. In other words, that angle is going to be 90 degrees.
If it's required for me to do it in your course, then you can obviously write that the arc cosine of,
we're going to have x, remember that's x over r, x is 0, so it's the arc cosine of 0,
and we know that's pi over 2, and we know that the arc sine, that's y over, y over, that's going to be 1,
y over r, y is 1, and r is 1, and the only thing that gives us that is pi over 2.
Well, I shouldn't say that because you can go around another 360 degrees, but that would be the principal argument.
Now, we can write z1, z1 is going to be 1 times the arc cosine, oh, not arc cosine, where am I going?
It's going to be the cosine of pi over 2 plus i times the sine of pi over 2.
z2, good. Let's do z2, z2. Now, we need the modulus of z2, which is going to be r2,
and that's going to be the square root of 1 squared plus square root of 3 squared,
that's 1 plus 3 is 4, square root of 4 equals 2.
And we need the arc cosine, remember that is x over r, 1 divided by 2, that's a half.
So we need that, and we also need the arc sine, remember you have to do both.
And sine is y over r, so that's negative 3 over 2.
Negative 3 divided by 2.
Now, just think to yourself, make life easy for yourself,
think where this is going to be on the complex coordinate system.
Think about it, we're going to have 1 across, and we're going to have 1 across.
So that's 1, and the square root of 3 is actually a bit more,
so it's going to be something down there.
And you can already guess that that's going to be negative pi over 3.
This, the curve squared root of 3 is more than 1, that goes across 1.
This angle is going to be smaller than that angle,
and I can tell you now, that's where we're going to end up.
Anyway, cosine is also positive only in 1 and 4,
and sine is only positive in 1 and 2,
so that's negative, sorry, in 2 and 4.
So, again, that tells us we are dealing with quadrant 4.
If we just look normally at cosine over 1 half,
cosine is also positive there,
cosine over 1 half would normally be pi over 3.
But we're not dealing with quadrant 1,
we're dealing with quadrant 4,
so that's going to be a negative pi over 3 satisfied.
So that equation, expression,
a negative pi over 3 satisfies that.
So we've left for z2 into equal 2 times the cosine of negative pi over 3
plus i times the sine of negative pi over 3.
Okay, so we've got those two.
Let's just do the z1 times z2.
That's what we need in the numerator.
And remember, z1 times z2 equals r1, r2 times,
oops, times the cosine of theta 1 plus theta 2
plus i times the sine of theta 1 plus theta 2.
Okay, so what is r1 times r2?
We have r1 here.
That's 1 times 2 is 2.
So we have 2 there.
Then we're going to have the cosine of theta 1 plus theta 2.
So it's pi over 2 plus negative pi over 3.
In other words, pi over 2 minus pi over 3.
We can get a common denominator of 6.
And when there's 3 minus 2, there's 1.
So it's pi over 6.
Pi over 6 plus i times the sine of, again, pi over 6.
And how much does that give us?
What is the cosine of pi over 6?
The cosine of pi over 6 is the square root of 3 over 2
plus i times what is the sine of pi over 6?
That is a half.
That is a half.
So if I multiply those out, I get square root of 3 plus i.
So that's z1 times z2.
Z1, z2.
Now though, look at z3.
It's also square root of 3 over i.
So I needn't have gone there.
I mean, the question will ask, express all three of these in polar form.
So you're obliged to also do that via that technique.
But just to save some time in these videos,
so if we have z1 divided, z1, z2 divided by z3,
that's going to be divided by square root of 3.
So you plus i, which you can do it,
multiply it by the conjugate over the conjugate of the denominator.
I mean, it's the same number, complex number divided by the same complex number.
It really is just as simple as being 1.
Good.
In this problem, we asked actually to get all the roots,
the square roots,
or the n equals 2 roots of negative i.
And let's try and sketch that.
Okay, so what are we saying?
What does this mean?
It means that z equals 0 plus,
so negative,
0 to negative i.
That's what we're saying.
We are saying that n equals 2.
We are saying that n equals 2.
Thus, we are saying that k equals 0 and 1.
That's what we are saying.
For us to get the roots,
we need to write z in polar form.
So first, we need the modulus of z.
That is going to be the square root of 0 squared plus negative 1 squared.
That is just going to be 1.
We need the angle,
so the half cosine of
x over r.
That's 0.
But just think to yourself,
where is negative i?
If you just draw it in your mind,
on the complex wooden system,
it points straight down,
what are you going to have?
You're going to have negative,
you're going to have negative pi over 2.
That's because the arc sine
of this negative 1
is also negative pi over 2.
If you just draw it in your mind's eye,
you'll very quickly see
negative i points straight down,
so it's going to be negative 90 degrees.
So now we can write z as,
we can write z as
1 times the cosine
of negative pi over 2
plus i times the sine
of negative pi over 2.
Now let's remind ourselves
how we get the root.
The roots, the nth roots,
so z to the power 1
over n equals
the nth root of the modulus,
which is always positive,
because we define it as
e squared plus b squared
and the positive square root of that
because it's magnitude,
it's just length.
It's always going to be the positive
times the cosine of,
well, it was pi divided by,
theta divided by n
plus 2k pi divided by n,
that is as we rotate,
plus i times the sine
of theta divided by n
plus 2k pi divided by n.
I don't know if you can see
in the corner there,
probably not.
Okay, but you,
by now,
if I wake you up,
the frame is all saying,
we had as advanced,
here's undergraduate students
in medicine,
if I wake you up
in the middle of the night,
you should tell me
the 16 courses
are the two bacteria types.
So there you go,
that one you should know.
You can use the Moivre's
theorem equation,
you can get there,
but it's best if that just
becomes part of your existence,
part of your life.
So let's start,
we have k0 and k1,
we're going to start
with k equals 0.
In other words,
z to the power of half
is going to equal
the square root,
because that's a 2,
and that's one square root of 2,
is just 1,
times the cosine of,
we have
negative pi over 2
divided by 2,
so that's going to be
negative pi over 4,
negative pi over 4,
plus,
k is now 0,
so that bit is 0,
plus i times the sine
of negative pi over 4.
So z to the power of half
is going to be,
what is the cosine
of negative an angle?
It is equal to the cosine
of that angle.
What is the cosine
of pi over 4?
That's 1 over square root
of 2.
Now what is the sine
of negative an angle?
That is negative
the sine of that angle,
so this is going to become
negative,
the sine of that
is also 1 over square root
of 2i.
Okay,
so if we had to draw that,
if we had to draw that,
so,
now,
square root of 2
is more than 1,
so that is going to be,
on the real axis,
on the real axis,
we're going to go
just more than 1,
just under 1,
because the denominator
is larger than the numerator,
so if that's 1,
we're probably going to go
just there,
and we're going to go
down the same amount
on the negative side,
on the negative i side,
so that is going to be
our first vector,
and if you write it
as an order,
it will be 1 over square root
of 2,
and negative 1 over square root
of 2.
Okay,
but remember what we said
just about the rotation,
a full rotation
is 2 pi,
that's a full rotation,
and I'm dividing
my full rotation
up into,
n equals 2 pi,
so I'm dividing it
by 2,
that equals pi,
so,
my next vector
is just going to be
pi units across
from this one,
so I've got to rotate
through pi,
so this is just going
to be straight
in the opposite direction,
so what is this going
to be?
This is going to be
negative 1 over
square root of 2,
and that is going
to be positive.
New chalk,
square root of 2.
Okay,
so that would be
my second,
that would be
my second one,
I don't even have
to do it,
if you are obliged
to do it,
put a 1 there,
the 2's will cancel,
so I'm just going
to add another pi,
and that's what
you see there as well,
I'm just rotating
by another pi radius,
so this second root
is just going to be
negative 1 over
square root of 2
plus 1 over
square root of 2i,
plus 1 over 2
square root of pi,
so if you're obliged
to work it out,
please write it out,
so that was going
to be negative pi
over 4 plus
another,
plus 4,
4 over,
4 pi over 4,
because it's just pi,
and I'm getting
the same denominator
which is 4,
so that leaves me
with 3 quarters pi,
and you can just,
in sine of,
the cosine of the sine
of that,
you can work it out,
but it's much better
to understand
what is happening here,
I'm adding another
pi to my angle,
I'm adding,
I'm rotating another
pi radius,
which is 180 degrees,
which makes it
much simpler to do.
