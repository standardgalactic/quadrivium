The text discusses finding the equation for a tangent plane to a graph defined by \( z = \sin(xy) \) in three-dimensional space at the point \( (0, \pi) \). The process involves two methods:

1. **Direct Method**: 
   - Calculate the gradient of the function \( f(x, y) = \sin(xy) \).
   - At the point \( (0, \pi) \), evaluate the gradient:  
     \[
     \nabla f = \left( y \cos(xy), x \cos(xy) \right)
     \]
   - Substitute the coordinates into the gradient to get \( \nabla f(0, \pi) = (\pi, 0) \).
   - Use this gradient and the point to find the equation of the tangent plane:
     \[
     z = \pi x
     \]

2. **Contour Method**:
   - Define a new function \( g(x, y, z) = \sin(xy) - z \), treating it as a contour in higher dimensions.
   - Find the gradient of \( g \):
     \[
     \nabla g = (y \cos(xy), x \cos(xy), -1)
     \]
   - At point \( P(0, \pi, 0) \), this becomes:
     \[
     \nabla g(0, \pi, 0) = (\pi, 0, -1)
     \]
   - The dot product between the gradient vector and a vector in the tangent plane is set to zero to find the tangent plane equation:
     \[
     z = \pi x
     \]

Finally, it discusses finding the tangent line to the contour curve \( \sin(xy) = 0 \), which represents a level curve in two-dimensional space. The text highlights how gradients can be used to determine tangents even when separating variables isn't straightforward, showcasing an extension of first-year calculus concepts into multivariable functions.

The text describes a process for finding the gradient and tangent line to a contour of a function at a specific point. Here's a summary:

1. **Gradient Calculation**: The speaker determines the gradient at a specific point, which is given as \(\pi, 0\).

2. **Perpendicular Vector**: This gradient vector is perpendicular to the tangent of the contour at that point.

3. **Vector in the Plane**: Another vector in the plane is defined using coordinates \(x\) and \(y\), minus a point \((0, \pi)\), resulting in the vector \((x, y) - (\pi, 0)\).

4. **Dot Product**: The dot product of the gradient vector \(\pi, 0\) and the plane vector \((x, y) - (\pi, 0)\) is set to zero to find the tangent line.

5. **Equation for Tangent Line**: Solving this results in \(x = 0\), which represents the equation of the tangent line to the contour at the point where the function's contour is zero.

6. **Contour Method Insight**: The method highlights how using contours can provide an alternative way to find derivatives and tangents, beyond traditional calculus techniques.
