The text discusses finding the equation for a tangent plane to a graph defined by \( z = \sin(xy) \) in three-dimensional space at the point \( (0, \pi) \). The process involves two methods:

1. **Direct Method**: 
   - Calculate the gradient of the function \( f(x, y) = \sin(xy) \).
   - At the point \( (0, \pi) \), evaluate the gradient:  
     \[
     \nabla f = \left( y \cos(xy), x \cos(xy) \right)
     \]
   - Substitute the coordinates into the gradient to get \( \nabla f(0, \pi) = (\pi, 0) \).
   - Use this gradient and the point to find the equation of the tangent plane:
     \[
     z = \pi x
     \]

2. **Contour Method**:
   - Define a new function \( g(x, y, z) = \sin(xy) - z \), treating it as a contour in higher dimensions.
   - Find the gradient of \( g \):
     \[
     \nabla g = (y \cos(xy), x \cos(xy), -1)
     \]
   - At point \( P(0, \pi, 0) \), this becomes:
     \[
     \nabla g(0, \pi, 0) = (\pi, 0, -1)
     \]
   - The dot product between the gradient vector and a vector in the tangent plane is set to zero to find the tangent plane equation:
     \[
     z = \pi x
     \]

Finally, it discusses finding the tangent line to the contour curve \( \sin(xy) = 0 \), which represents a level curve in two-dimensional space. The text highlights how gradients can be used to determine tangents even when separating variables isn't straightforward, showcasing an extension of first-year calculus concepts into multivariable functions.

The text describes a process for finding the gradient and tangent line to a contour of a function at a specific point. Here's a summary:

1. **Gradient Calculation**: The speaker determines the gradient at a specific point, which is given as \(\pi, 0\).

2. **Perpendicular Vector**: This gradient vector is perpendicular to the tangent of the contour at that point.

3. **Vector in the Plane**: Another vector in the plane is defined using coordinates \(x\) and \(y\), minus a point \((0, \pi)\), resulting in the vector \((x, y) - (\pi, 0)\).

4. **Dot Product**: The dot product of the gradient vector \(\pi, 0\) and the plane vector \((x, y) - (\pi, 0)\) is set to zero to find the tangent line.

5. **Equation for Tangent Line**: Solving this results in \(x = 0\), which represents the equation of the tangent line to the contour at the point where the function's contour is zero.

6. **Contour Method Insight**: The method highlights how using contours can provide an alternative way to find derivatives and tangents, beyond traditional calculus techniques.

The text explains how to find the equation for a tangent plane to a surface defined by a multivariable function in three-dimensional space using two methods: direct differentiation and the method of contours.

1. **Surface Equation**: The surface is described by \( z = f(x, y) = \sin(xy) \). We are interested in finding the tangent plane at point \( P(0, \pi, 0) \).

2. **Direct Differentiation Method**:
   - First, evaluate \( f \) at point \( P \): \( f(0, \pi) = \sin(0) = 0 \).
   - Calculate the gradient of \( f \), which involves partial derivatives using the chain rule:
     - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = y \cos(xy) \)
     - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x \cos(xy) \)
   - Evaluate the gradient at \( P(0, \pi) \): The partial derivatives become \( (\pi, 0) \).
   - Construct the tangent plane equation using \( z = f(P) + (x-x_0)\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(P) + (y-y_0)\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(P) \), resulting in \( z = \pi x \).

3. **Contour Method**:
   - Introduce a new function for the contour: \( g(x, y, z) = \sin(xy) - z \).
   - Compute the gradient of \( g \): 
     - \( \nabla g = (y\cos(xy), x\cos(xy), -1) \)
   - Evaluate this gradient at point \( P(0, \pi, 0) \), yielding \( (\pi, 0, -1) \).
   - The tangent plane is determined by the condition that the dot product of the gradient vector and a vector in the plane equals zero: \( \nabla g \cdot (x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0) = 0 \). This simplifies to \( z = \pi x \).

The text concludes by drawing an analogy between this process and finding tangents for curves in two-dimensional space. Even though the function \( \sin(xy) = 0 \) cannot be explicitly separated into a form like \( y = f(x) \), the gradient allows us to define a tangent line implicitly, extending concepts from single-variable calculus to multivariable scenarios.

The text discusses finding the gradient and tangent line to a contour of a function at a specific point using vectors. Initially, it identifies that the gradient at the given point is zero, which means it's \((\pi, 0)\). The next step involves finding a vector perpendicular to this gradient in the \(xy\)-plane; the chosen vector is \((x - \pi, y)\).

To find the tangent line, the dot product of the gradient and this new vector is set to zero:

\[
(\pi, 0) \cdot (x - \pi, y) = 0
\]

Simplifying this equation results in \( \pi x + 0 \cdot y - \pi^2 = 0\), leading to \(x = \pi\). This implies the tangent line at that point is vertical and given by the equation \(x = \pi\).

The text emphasizes using contour methods to find the derivative, highlighting that understanding contours can provide insights into derivatives at specific points, which might not be directly derivable through traditional calculus techniques.
