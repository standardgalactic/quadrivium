The text outlines a method for solving differential equations with non-constant coefficients by making a substitution using logarithmic transformation. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Substitution Using Logarithms**: The approach involves substituting \( t = \ln(x) \), which transforms the equation into one involving a new variable \( t \). This is based on the property that any number can be expressed as an exponential with base \( e \) and natural logarithm.

2. **Rewriting the Equation**: By expressing \( x^m \) as \( e^{m \ln(x)} \), the equation becomes one in terms of \( e \) raised to powers involving \( t \). This simplifies the handling of non-constant coefficients.

3. **Chain Rule Application**: Since \( y \) is now a function of \( t \), derivatives with respect to \( x \) are converted using the chain rule:
   - First derivative: \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dt} \)
   - Second derivative involves more complex application of the chain and product rules, resulting in: 
     \[
     \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{1}{x^2} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \frac{dy}{dt} \right)
     \]

4. **Solving the Transformed Equation**: With these substitutions, the differential equation is transformed into one involving \( t \), which can be solved using standard techniques for equations with constant coefficients.

5. **General Applicability**: This method applies to both homogeneous and non-homogeneous differential equations.

The text concludes by mentioning that an example will be provided in a subsequent video to illustrate this technique.
