The text outlines a method for solving differential equations with non-constant coefficients by making a substitution using logarithmic transformation. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Substitution Using Logarithms**: The approach involves substituting \( t = \ln(x) \), which transforms the equation into one involving a new variable \( t \). This is based on the property that any number can be expressed as an exponential with base \( e \) and natural logarithm.

2. **Rewriting the Equation**: By expressing \( x^m \) as \( e^{m \ln(x)} \), the equation becomes one in terms of \( e \) raised to powers involving \( t \). This simplifies the handling of non-constant coefficients.

3. **Chain Rule Application**: Since \( y \) is now a function of \( t \), derivatives with respect to \( x \) are converted using the chain rule:
   - First derivative: \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dt} \)
   - Second derivative involves more complex application of the chain and product rules, resulting in: 
     \[
     \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{1}{x^2} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \frac{dy}{dt} \right)
     \]

4. **Solving the Transformed Equation**: With these substitutions, the differential equation is transformed into one involving \( t \), which can be solved using standard techniques for equations with constant coefficients.

5. **General Applicability**: This method applies to both homogeneous and non-homogeneous differential equations.

The text concludes by mentioning that an example will be provided in a subsequent video to illustrate this technique.

The text discusses a method for solving differential equations with non-constant coefficients by using substitution and transformation techniques. The key steps in this approach include:

1. **Substitution of Variables:** Introduce a new variable \( t \) such that \( t = \ln(x) \). Consequently, \( x \) can be expressed as \( e^t \).

2. **Transformation of the Equation:** Rewrite expressions like \( c_1 x^{m_1} + c_2 x^{m_2} \) in terms of \( t \), leading to \( c_1 e^{m_1 t} + c_2 e^{m_2 t} \).

3. **Change of Differentiation Variables:** Since the original variable \( x \) is now expressed as a function of \( t \), derivatives with respect to \( x \) need to be converted into derivatives with respect to \( t \). This involves using the chain rule.

4. **Chain Rule Application:**
   - The first derivative, \( y' = \frac{dy}{dx} \), becomes \( \frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dt} \).
   - For the second derivative, \( y'' = \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \), apply the product and chain rules to obtain:
     \[
     y'' = \frac{1}{x}\left(\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}\right) - \frac{1}{x^2}\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)
     \]

5. **Solving the Transformed Equation:** With \( y \) now expressed as a function of \( t \), solve the differential equation using standard techniques for equations with constant coefficients.

This method can be applied to both homogeneous and non-homogeneous equations, allowing for solutions that are otherwise difficult to obtain directly in terms of \( x \). The text indicates that an example will follow in subsequent content.
