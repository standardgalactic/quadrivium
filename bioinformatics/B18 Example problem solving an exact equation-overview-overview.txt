The text discusses solving a differential equation presented in exact form involving functions of \(x\) and \(y\):

\[ m(x, y) = e^{2y} - y \cos(xy) \]
\[ n(x, y) = 2x e^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + 2y \]

To determine if the differential equation is exact, we need to verify that:

\[ \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} \]

Calculating these partial derivatives:
- The derivative of \( m(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \):
  \[ \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} = 2e^{2y} - \cos(xy) - xy \sin(xy) \]
  
- The derivative of \( n(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \):
  \[ \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} = 2e^{2y} - \cos(xy) - xy \sin(xy) \]

Since these derivatives are equal, the differential equation is confirmed as exact.

Next, we integrate:
1. \( m(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \):
   \[ f(x, y) = xe^{2y} - \sin(xy) + g(y) \]
   Here, \( g(y) \) is an unknown function of \( y \).

2. To find \( g(y) \), we differentiate \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \) and set it equal to \( n(x, y) \):
   \[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xe^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + g'(y) = 2x e^{2y} - x \cos(xy) + 2y \]

This gives the differential equation for \( g(y) \):
\[ g'(y) = 2y \]

Integrating both sides yields:
\[ g(y) = y^2 + C \]

Thus, the solution to the original differential equation is:
\[ f(x, y) = xe^{2y} - \sin(xy) + y^2 + C = 0 \]

This represents a family of solutions parameterized by an arbitrary constant \( C \). The text concludes that solving explicitly for one variable in terms of the other might be challenging due to the transcendental nature of the equation.
