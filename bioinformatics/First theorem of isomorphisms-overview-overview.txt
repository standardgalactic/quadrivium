The text explains the First Isomorphism Theorem, a key concept in group theory involving an isomorphism \( f \) between two groups \( g \) and \( h \). Here's a summary of the main points:

1. **Kernel of the Isomorphism**: The kernel \(\text{ker}(f)\), consisting of elements in \( g \) mapping to the identity in \( h \), is a normal subgroup of \( g \).

2. **Quotient Groups and Cosets**: By using the kernel, quotient groups are formed from \( g \) through cosets.

3. **Mapping Properties**:
   - The function \( f \) from the quotient group \( g/\text{ker}(f) \) to \( h \) is surjective (every element in \( h \) has a preimage).
   - It's also injective because if two elements map to the same point in \( h \), they must be in the same coset, otherwise it contradicts their distinctness.

4. **Isomorphism**: Since \( f \) is both surjective and injective, it forms a bijection between \( g/\text{ker}(f) \) and \( h \), establishing an isomorphism.

5. **First Isomorphism Theorem**: The theorem concludes that the quotient group \( g/\text{ker}(f) \) is isomorphic to \( h \). This illustrates how groups are related via homomorphisms, showing that \( g \)'s structure modulo its kernel mirrors \( h \)'s structure.

Overall, this theorem provides a profound insight into the relationship between algebraic structures through mappings.
