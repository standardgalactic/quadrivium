The text discusses dropout regularization as a technique to address overfitting or high variance issues in machine learning models. When a model fits training data very well but performs poorly on validation or real-world data, dropout can be applied to prevent this by randomly setting some nodes' outputs to zero during training.

Dropout works by creating a mask of zeros and ones for each layer's nodes based on a predefined probability (keep probability). This effectively "drops" certain neurons in the network, which helps in preventing any single node from becoming overly influential. A key aspect is that after dropping, the remaining active neurons are scaled up to maintain overall output levels, ensuring consistent training behavior.

This technique constrains the hypothesis space by simplifying the model during training, potentially leading to better generalization on unseen data. Dropout can be easily added to existing models with minimal changes to code. The text also hints at a future discussion on implementing both L2 regularization and dropout together to further mitigate overfitting in datasets.
