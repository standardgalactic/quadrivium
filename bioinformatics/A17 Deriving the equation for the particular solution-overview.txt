The text outlines the process of solving non-homogeneous linear differential equations using the variation of parameters method. Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Setup**: The problem involves finding a particular solution to a system represented by \( x' = Ax + f(t) \), where \( A \) is a matrix and \( f(t) \) is a non-zero vector function.

2. **Complementary Solution**: The complementary (homogeneous) solution, \( x_c \), is given by \( x_c = \Phi(t)c \), where \( \Phi(t) \) is the fundamental matrix of solutions for the homogeneous system \( x' = Ax \).

3. **Variation of Parameters**: Instead of using constants \( c \) in the complementary solution, we introduce a vector function \( u(t) \). The particular solution \( x_p \) is proposed as \( x_p = \Phi(t)u(t) \).

4. **Derivative and Substitution**: Taking the derivative of \( x_p \), we apply the product rule: \( x'_p = \Phi(t)u'(t) + \Phi'(t)u(t) \). Since \( \Phi'(t) = A\Phi(t) \), this becomes \( x'_p = \Phi(t)u'(t) + A\Phi(t)u(t) \).

5. **Equating Derivatives**: By substituting into the original equation, we equate:
   \[
   \Phi(t)u'(t) + A\Phi(t)u(t) = A\Phi(t)u(t) + f(t)
   \]
   Simplifying gives \( \Phi(t)u'(t) = f(t) \).

6. **Solving for \( u(t) \)**: Since \( \Phi(t) \) is non-singular, we can multiply by its inverse:
   \[
   u'(t) = \Phi^{-1}(t)f(t)
   \]
   Integrating both sides gives:
   \[
   u(t) = \int \Phi^{-1}(t)f(t) \, dt
   \]

7. **Particular Solution**: The particular solution is then:
   \[
   x_p = \Phi(t) \int \Phi^{-1}(t)f(t) \, dt
   \]

8. **General Solution**: The general solution to the non-homogeneous system is \( x = x_c + x_p = \Phi(t)c + \Phi(t) \int \Phi^{-1}(t)f(t) \, dt \).

This method, known as variation of parameters, provides a systematic way to find particular solutions for non-homogeneous linear differential equations.
