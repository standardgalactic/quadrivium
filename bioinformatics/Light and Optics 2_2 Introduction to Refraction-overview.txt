To address your question, let's go through each part step by step.

### Part 1: Speed of Light in Diamond

The speed of light \( c \) in a vacuum is approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). The refractive index \( n \) relates the speed of light in a medium to that in a vacuum by:

\[
v = \frac{c}{n}
\]

For diamond with a refractive index \( n = 2.42 \):

\[
v = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{2.42} \approx 1.24 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Part 2: Critical Angle from Diamond to Air

The critical angle \( \theta_c \) is found using Snell's Law, where the sine of the critical angle equals the ratio of the refractive indices:

\[
\sin(\theta_c) = \frac{n_t}{n_i}
\]

For light passing from diamond (\( n_i = 2.42 \)) to air (\( n_t = 1 \)):

\[
\sin(\theta_c) = \frac{1}{2.42} \approx 0.4132
\]

Thus, the critical angle is:

\[
\theta_c = \arcsin(0.4132) \approx 24.4^\circ
\]

### Part 3: Critical Angle from Glass to Water

For light passing from glass (\( n_i = 1.54 \)) to water (\( n_t = 1.33 \)), the critical angle is:

\[
\sin(\theta_c) = \frac{1.33}{1.54} \approx 0.8636
\]

Thus, the critical angle is:

\[
\theta_c = \arcsin(0.8636) \approx 59.7^\circ
\]

### Summary

- **Speed of Light in Diamond**: \( \approx 1.24 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Critical Angle (Diamond to Air)**: \( \approx 24.4^\circ \)
- **Critical Angle (Glass to Water)**: \( \approx 59.7^\circ \) 

These calculations confirm the steps and results you've outlined.

The text discusses refraction and the concept of the critical angle when light transitions between different media. Initially, it considers the transition from glass (with an index of 1.54) to water (with an index of 1.33), where the critical angle was calculated as approximately 59.7 degrees. 

Now, reversing the scenario—considering light traveling from water to glass—it's noted that no critical angle exists for this case. When calculating using the indices (1.33/1.54), the result is undefined, indicating there isn't an incident angle at which total internal reflection occurs when transitioning from a medium of lower refractive index (water) to one of higher refractive index (glass). This means that no matter how much you increase the angle of incidence in water-to-glass refraction, the light will not be totally internally reflected; it will always pass through into the glass.
