To address your question, let's go through each part step by step.

### Part 1: Speed of Light in Diamond

The speed of light \( c \) in a vacuum is approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). The refractive index \( n \) relates the speed of light in a medium to that in a vacuum by:

\[
v = \frac{c}{n}
\]

For diamond with a refractive index \( n = 2.42 \):

\[
v = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{2.42} \approx 1.24 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Part 2: Critical Angle from Diamond to Air

The critical angle \( \theta_c \) is found using Snell's Law, where the sine of the critical angle equals the ratio of the refractive indices:

\[
\sin(\theta_c) = \frac{n_t}{n_i}
\]

For light passing from diamond (\( n_i = 2.42 \)) to air (\( n_t = 1 \)):

\[
\sin(\theta_c) = \frac{1}{2.42} \approx 0.4132
\]

Thus, the critical angle is:

\[
\theta_c = \arcsin(0.4132) \approx 24.4^\circ
\]

### Part 3: Critical Angle from Glass to Water

For light passing from glass (\( n_i = 1.54 \)) to water (\( n_t = 1.33 \)), the critical angle is:

\[
\sin(\theta_c) = \frac{1.33}{1.54} \approx 0.8636
\]

Thus, the critical angle is:

\[
\theta_c = \arcsin(0.8636) \approx 59.7^\circ
\]

### Summary

- **Speed of Light in Diamond**: \( \approx 1.24 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Critical Angle (Diamond to Air)**: \( \approx 24.4^\circ \)
- **Critical Angle (Glass to Water)**: \( \approx 59.7^\circ \) 

These calculations confirm the steps and results you've outlined.

The text discusses refraction and the concept of the critical angle when light transitions between different media. Initially, it considers the transition from glass (with an index of 1.54) to water (with an index of 1.33), where the critical angle was calculated as approximately 59.7 degrees. 

Now, reversing the scenario—considering light traveling from water to glass—it's noted that no critical angle exists for this case. When calculating using the indices (1.33/1.54), the result is undefined, indicating there isn't an incident angle at which total internal reflection occurs when transitioning from a medium of lower refractive index (water) to one of higher refractive index (glass). This means that no matter how much you increase the angle of incidence in water-to-glass refraction, the light will not be totally internally reflected; it will always pass through into the glass.

Let's break down each problem step-by-step:

### Problem 1: Critical Angle from Diamond to Air

**Given:**
- Refractive index of diamond (\(n_i\)) = 2.42
- Refractive index of air (\(n_t\)) ≈ 1 (since air is approximated as a vacuum)

**To Find:**
- Critical angle (\(\theta_c\)) for light passing from diamond to air.

**Formula:**
\[ \sin(\theta_c) = \frac{n_t}{n_i} \]

**Calculation:**
\[ \sin(\theta_c) = \frac{1}{2.42} \]
\[ \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{2.42}\right) \]
\[ \theta_c \approx 24.4^\circ \]

### Problem 2: Critical Angle from Glass to Water

**Given:**
- Refractive index of glass (\(n_i\)) = 1.54
- Refractive index of water (\(n_t\)) = 1.33

**To Find:**
- Critical angle (\(\theta_c\)) for light passing from glass to water.

**Formula:**
\[ \sin(\theta_c) = \frac{n_t}{n_i} \]

**Calculation:**
\[ \sin(\theta_c) = \frac{1.33}{1.54} \]
\[ \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{1.33}{1.54}\right) \]
\[ \theta_c \approx 59.7^\circ \]

### Problem 3: Angle of Reflected and Transmitted Rays

**Given:**
- Incident angle (\(\theta_i\)) = 50°
- Refractive index of initial medium (air, \(n_i\)) ≈ 1
- Refractive index of glass (\(n_t\)) = 1.50

**To Find:**
- Angle of reflected ray (\(\theta_r\))
- Angle of transmitted ray (\(\theta_t\))

**Reflection:**
By the law of reflection:
\[ \theta_r = \theta_i = 50^\circ \]

**Refraction (Snell's Law):**
\[ n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_t \sin(\theta_t) \]
\[ \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{n_i \sin(\theta_i)}{n_t} \]
\[ \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{1 \cdot \sin(50^\circ)}{1.50} \]

**Calculation:**
\[ \sin(\theta_t) \approx \frac{0.766}{1.50} \]
\[ \sin(\theta_t) \approx 0.511 \]
\[ \theta_t = \arcsin(0.511) \]
\[ \theta_t \approx 31^\circ \]

### Summary:
- **Critical Angle (Diamond to Air):** \(24.4^\circ\)
- **Critical Angle (Glass to Water):** \(59.7^\circ\)
- **Reflected Ray:** \(50^\circ\)
- **Transmitted Ray:** \(31^\circ\)

The text discusses the concept of the critical angle when light transitions between different media, specifically focusing on transitions involving glass and water. Initially, it recalls a previous problem where light was incident from glass (with an index of refraction 1.54) to water (index of refraction 1.33), resulting in a critical angle of 59.7 degrees.

The text then explores the reverse scenario: light transitioning from water to glass. In this case, since the light is moving from a medium with a lower refractive index (water) to one with a higher refractive index (glass), no critical angle exists for total internal reflection. This means that no matter how much you increase the incident angle in water, the light will never undergo total internal reflection at the interface and always enter into glass. Thus, when transitioning from a lower to a higher refractive index medium, the concept of a critical angle does not apply, as reflected rays cannot exceed 90 degrees relative to the normal inside the first medium (water).
