The text describes solving a second-order homogeneous differential equation, specifically \(d^2x + 2dx + 10x = 0\). The solution involves finding the characteristic (auxiliary) equation:

\[ m^2 + 2m + 10 = 0 \]

This equation does not have real roots; instead, it has complex roots given by:

\[ m = -1 \pm 3i \]

where \( \alpha = -1 \) and \( \beta = 3 \). The general solution for the differential equation is expressed as:

\[ x(t) = e^{-t}(c_1 \cos(3t) + c_2 \sin(3t)) \]

Given initial conditions, values for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are determined. With \( x(0) = -2 \), it is found that:

\[ c_1 = -2 \]

The derivative of the solution is used to solve for \( c_2 \):

\[ x'(t) = -c_1 e^{-t} (\cos(3t) + 3\sin(3t)) - c_2 e^{-t} (3\cos(3t) - \sin(3t)) \]

Setting \( x'(0) = 0 \), it is found that:

\[ c_2 = -\frac{2}{3} \]

Thus, the particular solution becomes:

\[ x(t) = -2 e^{-t} \cos(3t) - \frac{2}{3} e^{-t} \sin(3t) \]

The text then explains converting this to an alternate form \( A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \), where:

- \( A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3} \)

The phase angle \(\phi\) is determined using the arctangent function based on the ratio of \( c_2 \) to \( c_1 \), reflecting their positions on a Cartesian plane. The solution in this alternate form represents the same physical system but expressed differently, often useful for analyzing oscillatory motion.

The text describes a process of determining an angle and its sine value based on given coordinates in a Cartesian plane. Initially, it sets a position at negative \( \frac{2}{3} \) on the x-axis and negative 2 on the y-axis. The angle discussed is defined by these positions with reference to an angle \( \phi \). 

To find this angle, consider the difference between the full angle \( \phi \) and another part (also labeled as \( \phi \)), resulting in a smaller angle of interest. The length along the x-axis is identified as \( |\frac{-2}{3}| = \frac{2}{3} \), while the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by these coordinates is given as \( \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3} \). 

The sine of the small angle, which is equivalent to \( \sin(\phi - \pi) \), is calculated using the opposite side (length 2) over the hypotenuse, leading to a simplification involving the reciprocal. The calculation results in:

\[
\phi - \pi = \arcsin\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}\right)
\]

Solving for \( \phi \), we get:

\[
\phi = \pi + \arcsin\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}\right) 
\]

Numerically, this gives \( \phi \approx 4.391 \).

The text then relates this to a function involving time (\( t \)), specifically \( x(t) = \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3} \sin(3t + 4.391) \), which is consistent with the form given for another scenario where \( \omega^2 - \lambda^2 t = 3t \). The solution maintains consistency in terms of \( x(t) \) equating to 3, confirming that correct calculation and transformation of \( \phi \) result in maintaining the functional form.

The text presents a problem involving solving a homogeneous differential equation and expressing the solution in an alternate form. Here's a summary:

1. **Differential Equation**: The equation given is \(d^2 + 2d + 10 = 0\), which leads to the auxiliary equation \(m^2 + 2m + 10 = 0\).

2. **Solving the Auxiliary Equation**: Solving it results in complex roots: \(m = -1 \pm 3i\). This gives \(\alpha = -1\) and \(\beta = 3\), leading to the general solution for \(x(t)\) as:
   \[
   x(t) = e^{-t}(c_1 \cos(3t) + c_2 \sin(3t))
   \]

3. **Initial Conditions**: The problem is an initial value problem, requiring solving for constants \(c_1\) and \(c_2\). Given conditions are used to find:
   - \(c_1 = -2\)
   - \(c_2 = -\frac{2}{3}\)

4. **Alternate Form**: The solution needs to be expressed in the form \(A \sin(\omega t + \phi)\), where:
   - \(A\) is calculated as \(\sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3}\)
   - The phase angle \(\phi\) can be determined using the arctangent of \(-\frac{c_2}{c_1}\), considering their signs for correct quadrant placement.

The text highlights a process of solving differential equations, applying initial conditions, and converting solutions into alternate trigonometric forms.

The text describes a process for determining an angle in polar coordinates and using it to find a particular sine function expression. Here's a summary:

1. **Position on Axes**: The starting point is at negative 2/3 along the x-axis and -2 on the y-axis.

2. **Defining Angles**:
   - The angle of interest, \(\phi\), is determined by considering the entire angle down to a specific reference.
   - The text uses trigonometry to find that \(\phi\) minus an angle (which appears as \(\pi\) or 180 degrees) helps identify the required small angle.

3. **Calculating Sine**:
   - It calculates the sine of this "little" angle using the opposite side and hypotenuse.
   - The length calculations for sides involve a square root term: \(2\sqrt{10}/3\).

4. **Inverse Sine Function**:
   - The text finds that \(\phi - \pi\) equals the arc sine (inverse sine) of \(3/\sqrt{10}\).
   - This leads to \(\phi = \pi + \text{arc sine}(3/\sqrt{10})\), which numerically evaluates to approximately 4.391.

5. **Application in a Function**:
   - The final expression for \(x(t)\) is based on this angle: it's \(2\sqrt{10}/3\) times the sine of an expression involving time, specifically \(3t + 4.391\).

6. **Simplification**:
   - For the given example, simplifying yields a consistent result where \(\omega^2 - \lambda^2 t = 3t\).
   - Thus, without further computation, it's confirmed that the form remains as \(3t\) in this context. The focus is on correctly determining \(\phi\).
