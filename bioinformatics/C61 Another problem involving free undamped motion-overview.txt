The text describes solving a second-order homogeneous differential equation, specifically \(d^2x + 2dx + 10x = 0\). The solution involves finding the characteristic (auxiliary) equation:

\[ m^2 + 2m + 10 = 0 \]

This equation does not have real roots; instead, it has complex roots given by:

\[ m = -1 \pm 3i \]

where \( \alpha = -1 \) and \( \beta = 3 \). The general solution for the differential equation is expressed as:

\[ x(t) = e^{-t}(c_1 \cos(3t) + c_2 \sin(3t)) \]

Given initial conditions, values for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are determined. With \( x(0) = -2 \), it is found that:

\[ c_1 = -2 \]

The derivative of the solution is used to solve for \( c_2 \):

\[ x'(t) = -c_1 e^{-t} (\cos(3t) + 3\sin(3t)) - c_2 e^{-t} (3\cos(3t) - \sin(3t)) \]

Setting \( x'(0) = 0 \), it is found that:

\[ c_2 = -\frac{2}{3} \]

Thus, the particular solution becomes:

\[ x(t) = -2 e^{-t} \cos(3t) - \frac{2}{3} e^{-t} \sin(3t) \]

The text then explains converting this to an alternate form \( A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \), where:

- \( A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3} \)

The phase angle \(\phi\) is determined using the arctangent function based on the ratio of \( c_2 \) to \( c_1 \), reflecting their positions on a Cartesian plane. The solution in this alternate form represents the same physical system but expressed differently, often useful for analyzing oscillatory motion.

The text describes a process of determining an angle and its sine value based on given coordinates in a Cartesian plane. Initially, it sets a position at negative \( \frac{2}{3} \) on the x-axis and negative 2 on the y-axis. The angle discussed is defined by these positions with reference to an angle \( \phi \). 

To find this angle, consider the difference between the full angle \( \phi \) and another part (also labeled as \( \phi \)), resulting in a smaller angle of interest. The length along the x-axis is identified as \( |\frac{-2}{3}| = \frac{2}{3} \), while the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by these coordinates is given as \( \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3} \). 

The sine of the small angle, which is equivalent to \( \sin(\phi - \pi) \), is calculated using the opposite side (length 2) over the hypotenuse, leading to a simplification involving the reciprocal. The calculation results in:

\[
\phi - \pi = \arcsin\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}\right)
\]

Solving for \( \phi \), we get:

\[
\phi = \pi + \arcsin\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}\right) 
\]

Numerically, this gives \( \phi \approx 4.391 \).

The text then relates this to a function involving time (\( t \)), specifically \( x(t) = \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3} \sin(3t + 4.391) \), which is consistent with the form given for another scenario where \( \omega^2 - \lambda^2 t = 3t \). The solution maintains consistency in terms of \( x(t) \) equating to 3, confirming that correct calculation and transformation of \( \phi \) result in maintaining the functional form.
