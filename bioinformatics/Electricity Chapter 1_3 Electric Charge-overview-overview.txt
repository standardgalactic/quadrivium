Here's a concise summary of the text, focusing on the key physics concepts related to electrostatic forces and Coulomb's law:

1. **Problem with Two Identical Charged Particles:**
   - Two positively charged particles repel each other.
   - Given their initial separation (3.2 x 10^-3 meters) and different accelerations (7 m/s² for the first particle, 9 m/s² for the second), Newton's third law is used to calculate forces.
   - By equating \( F = ma \), the mass of the second particle is found to be \( 4.9 \times 10^{-7} \) kg.
   - Coulomb’s law helps determine that each particle has a charge of \( 7.1 \times 10^{-11} \) C.

2. **Maximizing Electrostatic Force:**
   - When transferring charge from one sphere to another, the electrostatic force is maximized when the ratio \( q/Q \) (charge given off to initial charge) is 0.5.

3. **Electrostatic Equilibrium of Three Particles:**
   - A third charge \( q_3 \) must be placed for equilibrium between a positive charge (\( q1 \)) and a negative charge (\( q2 \)), separated by 0.1 meters.
   - The forces from \( q1 \) and \( q2 \) on \( q3 \) need to balance each other, which occurs at approximately -0.14 meters on the negative x-axis.
   - Coulomb’s law is used to set up an equation for force balance, showing that the position depends only on distances and not the specific value or sign of \( q_3 \).

The text illustrates how Newton's laws and Coulomb's law are applied to determine masses, charges, and equilibrium positions in systems involving charged particles.
