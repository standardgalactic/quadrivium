The text describes solving an indefinite integral involving the expressions \( \frac{x^2}{x^3} \) and \( (21 - 1)^6 \). The solution involves substitution, where \( u = \frac{x^3}{20} \) is set as a new variable. Differentiating gives \( du = \frac{3x^2}{20} dx \), leading to the rearrangement \( x^2 dx = \frac{20}{3} du \).

Substituting these into the integral transforms it into:

\[
\int u^6 \cdot \frac{20}{3} \, du
\]

Applying the constant multiple rule simplifies this to:

\[
\frac{20}{3} \int u^6 \, du
\]

The antiderivative of \( u^6 \) is \( \frac{u^7}{7} \), resulting in:

\[
\frac{20}{21} u^7 + C
\]

Substituting back for \( u = \frac{x^3}{20} \):

\[
= \frac{20}{21} \left(\frac{x^3}{20}\right)^7 + C
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
= \frac{1}{21} x^{21} (21 - 1)^{-7} + C
\]

Finally, this becomes:

\[
\frac{x^{21}}{21^{6} \cdot 20^7} + C
\]

This is the expression for the indefinite integral of the given functions.
