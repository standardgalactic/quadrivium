The text provides a step-by-step solution for evaluating a surface integral over a cube using Gauss's theorem (also known as the Divergence Theorem). Here’s a concise summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: The goal is to evaluate the surface integral of a vector field \(\mathbf{f}(x, y, z) = (x, y, y^2, z, z^3)\) over the surface of a cube with boundaries \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 1\).

2. **Enclosed Region**: The cube is an enclosed space and has piecewise smooth surfaces, making it suitable for applying Gauss's theorem.

3. **Gauss's Theorem Application**: Instead of calculating the surface integral over each face of the cube separately (which would require six integrals), Gauss's theorem allows converting the problem into a triple integral over the volume of the cube. Specifically:
   \[
   \iint_{\partial D} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \iiint_D (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dv
   \]
   where \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}\) is the divergence of \(\mathbf{f}\).

4. **Divergence Calculation**: The divergence of \(\mathbf{f}\) is computed as:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 1 + 2yz + 3z^2
   \]

5. **Volume Integral Setup**: The volume integral over the cube \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 1\) is set up as:
   \[
   \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y + 2yz + 3z^2) \, dz \, dy \, dx
   \]

6. **Integration Process**: The integration proceeds by first integrating with respect to \(z\), then \(y\), and finally \(x\). This yields:
   - Integrate with respect to \(z\) from 0 to 1: 
     \[
     yz + yz^2 + z^3 \bigg|_0^1 = y + y + 1 = 2y + 1
     \]
   - Integrate the result with respect to \(y\):
     \[
     \int_0^1 (2y + 1) \, dy = y^2 + y \bigg|_0^1 = 1 + 1 = 2
     \]
   - Finally, integrate with respect to \(x\):
     \[
     \int_0^1 2 \, dx = 2x \bigg|_0^1 = 2
     \]

7. **Result**: Using Gauss's theorem simplifies the calculation significantly by reducing it from evaluating six separate surface integrals to a single triple integral over the cube's volume, yielding a final result of \(2\).

The text describes solving a surface integral problem involving a vector field over a cube defined by \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 1\). The task is to evaluate the surface integral of the dot product between this vector field \(\mathbf{f}(x, y, z) = (x, y, y^2, z, z^3)\) and a normal vector over the cube's surface. Instead of calculating integrals over each face separately, Gauss's theorem is applied.

Gauss’s theorem relates the surface integral over an enclosed surface to a triple integral of the divergence of the vector field over the volume inside that surface. The divergence \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}\) for the given vector field is calculated as:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(y^2z) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z^3) = 1 + 2yz + 3z^2.
\]

The triple integral is then set up over the cube with limits from 0 to 1 for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y + 2yz + 3z^2) \, dz \, dy \, dx.
\]

Evaluating the innermost integral with respect to \(z\) gives:
\[
\left[ yz + y z^2 + z^3 \right]_0^1 = y + y + 1 = 2y + 1.
\]

Next, integrating with respect to \(y\) from 0 to 1:
\[
\int_0^1 (2y + 1) \, dy = \left[ y^2 + y \right]_0^1 = 1 + 1 = 2.
\]

Finally, integrating with respect to \(x\) from 0 to 1 gives:
\[
\int_0^1 2 \, dx = 2.
\]

Thus, using Gauss's theorem simplifies the computation, resulting in a flux of 2 across the surface of the cube.
