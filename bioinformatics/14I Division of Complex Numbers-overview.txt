The text describes how to find the inverse of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix using a specific theorem and verify that it results in the identity matrix. Here's a summary:

1. **Matrix Inversion Formula**: For a \(2 \times 2\) matrix \(A = \begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{pmatrix}\), the inverse \(A^{-1}\) is given by:
   \[
   A^{-1} = \frac{1}{AD - BC} \begin{pmatrix} D & -B \\ -C & A \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This involves swapping \(A\) and \(D\), changing the signs of \(B\) and \(C\), and dividing by the determinant \(AD - BC\).

2. **Example Calculation**:
   - Consider matrix \(A = \begin{pmatrix} I & -2 \\ 1 & I \end{pmatrix}\).
   - The determinant is calculated as \(I^2 - (-2) = -1 + 2 = 1\).
   - Thus, the inverse \(A^{-1}\) becomes:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} I & 2 \\ -1 & I \end{pmatrix}
     \]

3. **Verification**:
   - Multiply \(A\) and \(A^{-1}\):
     \[
     A \times A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} I & -2 \\ 1 & I \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} I & 2 \\ -1 & I \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - The result is the identity matrix:
     \[
     \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
     \]

4. **Complex Numbers**:
   - For a matrix involving complex numbers, such as \(A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & I \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\), the inverse involves division by a complex number.
   - Use the complex conjugate to simplify calculations, ensuring the result is still the identity matrix when multiplied.

The text emphasizes using the determinant and specific manipulations (swapping and sign changes) to find the inverse of \(2 \times 2\) matrices and verifies this through multiplication resulting in the identity matrix.

The text emphasizes the importance of properly learning how to divide complex numbers. It suggests consistently practicing the correct method until one becomes comfortable and confident in performing these calculations. The example given is dividing by \( i \), highlighting that mistakes can happen if you take shortcuts or do not follow proper procedures. The key message is that while some problems may seem easy, consistent practice using the right technique will prevent errors in more challenging situations.

The text describes how to find and verify the inverse of a 2x2 matrix \( A \) using the formula for the inverse. The matrix \( A \) is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}
\]

According to the theorem, if the determinant (\( ad - bc \)) of this matrix is non-zero, then its inverse \( A^{-1} \) can be calculated using:

\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix}
\]

The text walks through an example where matrix \( A \) is specified as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} i & -2 \\ 1 & i \end{bmatrix}
\]

Using the formula, the inverse of \( A \) is found. The determinant is calculated first: 

\[ ad - bc = (i)(i) - (-2)(1) = -1 + 2 = 1 \]

So, the inverse \( A^{-1} \) becomes:

\[
A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} i & 2 \\ -1 & i \end{bmatrix}
\]

The text then verifies that multiplying \( A^{-1} \) by \( A \) results in the identity matrix. This involves performing matrix multiplication and confirming each element matches those of a 2x2 identity matrix:

\[
I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The verification is done both ways: \( A^{-1}A \) and \( AA^{-1} \), ensuring consistency.

Additionally, the text covers handling complex numbers in these calculations. Specifically, it demonstrates simplifying expressions involving division by imaginary units (such as \( i \)) using multiplication by conjugates to maintain real numbers when necessary.

Overall, this explanation provides a detailed walkthrough of finding the inverse of a 2x2 matrix with complex entries and verifying its correctness through multiplication.

The text emphasizes the importance of properly learning and practicing the division of complex numbers. It highlights that while some fractions, such as those involving "1 + i" divided by "i", might seem simple, they require correct methodology to avoid mistakes. The key message is to consistently apply the proper technique until one becomes comfortable and proficient, acknowledging that not all problems will be straightforward. This practice ensures accuracy and prevents errors in handling complex numbers.
