The text describes how to find the inverse of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix using a specific theorem and verify that it results in the identity matrix. Here's a summary:

1. **Matrix Inversion Formula**: For a \(2 \times 2\) matrix \(A = \begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{pmatrix}\), the inverse \(A^{-1}\) is given by:
   \[
   A^{-1} = \frac{1}{AD - BC} \begin{pmatrix} D & -B \\ -C & A \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This involves swapping \(A\) and \(D\), changing the signs of \(B\) and \(C\), and dividing by the determinant \(AD - BC\).

2. **Example Calculation**:
   - Consider matrix \(A = \begin{pmatrix} I & -2 \\ 1 & I \end{pmatrix}\).
   - The determinant is calculated as \(I^2 - (-2) = -1 + 2 = 1\).
   - Thus, the inverse \(A^{-1}\) becomes:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} I & 2 \\ -1 & I \end{pmatrix}
     \]

3. **Verification**:
   - Multiply \(A\) and \(A^{-1}\):
     \[
     A \times A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} I & -2 \\ 1 & I \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} I & 2 \\ -1 & I \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - The result is the identity matrix:
     \[
     \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
     \]

4. **Complex Numbers**:
   - For a matrix involving complex numbers, such as \(A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & I \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\), the inverse involves division by a complex number.
   - Use the complex conjugate to simplify calculations, ensuring the result is still the identity matrix when multiplied.

The text emphasizes using the determinant and specific manipulations (swapping and sign changes) to find the inverse of \(2 \times 2\) matrices and verifies this through multiplication resulting in the identity matrix.

The text emphasizes the importance of properly learning how to divide complex numbers. It suggests consistently practicing the correct method until one becomes comfortable and confident in performing these calculations. The example given is dividing by \( i \), highlighting that mistakes can happen if you take shortcuts or do not follow proper procedures. The key message is that while some problems may seem easy, consistent practice using the right technique will prevent errors in more challenging situations.
