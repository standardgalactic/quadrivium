In Lecture 3, the focus is on introducing the Python `math` module, which enhances Python's capabilities for performing various mathematical calculations. Here are the main ideas:

1. **Importing the Math Module**: To access advanced mathematical functions in Python, you need to import the `math` module using the statement `import math`.

2. **Accessing Constants and Functions**:
   - Access mathematical constants like Pi (`math.pi`) and Euler's number (`math.e`) by prefixing them with `math.`.
   - Use specific functions such as factorial (`math.factorial(x)`), exponentiation (`math.exp(x)`), logarithms (`math.log(x, base)`, where the default base is e for natural log), power calculations (`math.pow(base, exp)`), and square roots (`math.sqrt(x)`).

3. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - Calculate trigonometric values such as sine (`math.sin(x)`) and cosine.
   - Convert between degrees and radians using `math.radians(degrees)` to convert degrees to radians and `math.degrees(radians)` for the reverse.

4. **Precision and Rounding**: 
   - The module handles calculations with floating-point numbers, which may introduce slight rounding errors. This is evident when calculating values like sine of Pi, where results are approximate due to precision limits.

5. **Additional Functions**:
   - There are various other functions available in the `math` module, such as error and gamma functions for more advanced mathematical operations.

In summary, this lecture demonstrates how to extend Python's arithmetic capabilities by importing the `math` module, using it to perform complex calculations, and understanding precision limitations inherent in floating-point arithmetic.
