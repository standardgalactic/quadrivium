The text discusses how to determine the conditions for constructive and destructive interference in thin films with specific refractive indices. The focus is on understanding how light behaves when incident perpendicularly on such films.

Key points include:

- **Refractive Indices**: A thin film has a refractive index (n2) of 1.33, surrounded by air (n1 = 1).
  
- **Interference Conditions**:
  - For bright light (constructive interference), the path difference should be an integer multiple \( M \) of the wavelength.
  - For dark light (destructive interference), it should be \( M + \frac{1}{2} \).

- **Phase Change**: When light reflects from a medium with a higher refractive index, a half-wavelength phase change occurs.

- **Calculation**:
  - The thinnest film for constructive interference is when the thickness equals a quarter of the wavelength inside the film (\(\frac{\lambda}{4n2}\)).
  - For destructive interference at a given film width (245 nm in this example), the second thickest film corresponds to \( M = 1 \).

- **Application**: The text also describes applying these principles to solve problems, like determining unknown wavelengths or film thicknesses based on observed interference patterns.

The explanation emphasizes understanding the physical process over just using equations, aiming for a conceptual grasp of how light interacts with thin films.

The text discusses how to achieve destructive interference using a thin film setup. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: To create total destructive interference on one side of a thin film.

2. **Concepts**:
   - Destructive interference occurs when the path difference between two waves is an odd multiple of half wavelengths.
   - For destructive interference, \( N_2 - N_1 = N + \frac{1}{2} \), where \( N \) represents the number of wavelengths.

3. **Calculations**:
   - If total destructive interference is desired, then \( N_2 - N_1 = 1.5 \).
   - Given that \( N = \frac{L}{\lambda} \), and considering both paths traveled (Y and another Y), the equation becomes \( N_2 - N_1 = \frac{2YN}{\lambda} - \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Solving for wavelength (\(\lambda\)), it simplifies to \( \lambda = \frac{YN}{1} \).

4. **Key Points**:
   - The integer \( M \) represents the order of interference, starting at 0.
   - For destructive interference, use \( M + \frac{1}{2} \).
   - To find the thinnest film (where \( Y \) is unknown), set \( M = 0 \).

This approach allows you to directly calculate the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) based on the setup's parameters.
