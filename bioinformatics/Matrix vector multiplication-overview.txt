The text provides an introduction to multiplying matrices by vectors. It describes the process similar to regular matrix multiplication, emphasizing that the number of columns in the matrix must match the number of rows in the vector for the operation to be valid. The result is a new vector.

In the example given, a 2x2 matrix \( A \) (with elements [3, 2; 1, 4]) is multiplied by a 2x1 vector [1; 1]. This multiplication results in another 2x1 vector [5; 5].

The text then shifts to using Mathematica for performing such operations. It describes creating a 4x4 matrix and multiplying it by a corresponding 4x1 vector, showing how the process can be efficiently handled using software.

Overall, this multiplication is highlighted as an important operation with many applications, acting on vectors to produce new ones. The text concludes by suggesting that further exploration into matrices and vectors will reveal more of their properties and uses.
