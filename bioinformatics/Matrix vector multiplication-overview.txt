The text provides an introduction to multiplying matrices by vectors. It describes the process similar to regular matrix multiplication, emphasizing that the number of columns in the matrix must match the number of rows in the vector for the operation to be valid. The result is a new vector.

In the example given, a 2x2 matrix \( A \) (with elements [3, 2; 1, 4]) is multiplied by a 2x1 vector [1; 1]. This multiplication results in another 2x1 vector [5; 5].

The text then shifts to using Mathematica for performing such operations. It describes creating a 4x4 matrix and multiplying it by a corresponding 4x1 vector, showing how the process can be efficiently handled using software.

Overall, this multiplication is highlighted as an important operation with many applications, acting on vectors to produce new ones. The text concludes by suggesting that further exploration into matrices and vectors will reveal more of their properties and uses.

The text provides an introduction to multiplying matrices by vectors. It explains that for multiplication, itâ€™s essential to match the number of columns in the matrix with the number of rows in the vector. An example is provided: a 2x2 matrix multiplied by a 1x2 vector results in a 2x1 vector. This operation transforms vectors and has various applications.

The text then demonstrates this multiplication using specific matrices and vectors, showing how to perform calculations manually. It emphasizes that multiplying a matrix by a vector yields another vector.

Additionally, the author introduces using Mathematica for matrix-vector multiplication. They provide an example with a 4x4 matrix and a 4x1 vector, illustrating how to input these into Mathematica using dot notation (e.g., `A.V`) to perform the operation easily. The text highlights that Mathematica simplifies this process and makes it accessible without detailed manual calculations.

Overall, the introduction serves as both a theoretical explanation of matrix-vector multiplication and a practical demonstration using software tools.
