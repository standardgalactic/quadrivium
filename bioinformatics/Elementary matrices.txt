Let's continue our look deeper into matrices and I'm going to talk to you
today about elementary matrices you might have seen those that is what is
used to solve systems of linear equations to get to reduced row echelon
form or at least row form and this is in preparation of something called LU
decomposition of a matrix lower upper and we'll talk about what a lower
triangular and upper triangular matrix is in the next video but today we're going
to concentrate on elementary matrices how do we get to reduce row echelon form or
just echelon form now I'm going to cheat again by just creating a system of
linear equations two equations and two unknowns and I'm going to let x equals 2
and y equals 1 I plug that in with some coefficients I see what the solution is
so that I have the system of equations to work with and I know that x must be 2
and y must be 1 and from that I've created my I have created my my augmented matrix
here let's call this augmented matrix a a it's my augmented matrix now what would we
do to this is we see that we need a 0 in this position 0 in this position how would we do that
well I would take minus a quarter times the first row and add that to the second row because minus a
quarter times 4 is minus 1 minus 1 plus 1 is 0 and I'll get a 0 there but let me do something very
special let me start with the identity matrix and identity matrix as far as a 2 by 2 matrix is
concerned would be 1 0 1 0 0 1 and let's see what I would have done here I would have said
minus a quarter times row 1 added to row 2 let's do that to the identity matrix minus a quarter times
row 1 which will leave this at minus a quarter and minus a quarter times 0 that's 0 and I'm going to add
that to row 2 and that is going to be my what I call my first elementary matrix and I'm going to write
that as e so minus a quarter so I'm still having 0 and 0 and 1 in the first row but for the second row
is going to be minus a quarter times the first row so that's minus a quarter plus 0 that leaves me with
minus a quarter minus a quarter times the first row that's still 0 plus my 1 gives me 1 and I'm going to
call this my first elementary matrix and let's do the following here let's do e1 times a e1 times a
will that work well this is 2 by 2 and this is 2 by 3 2 by 2 times 2 by 3 that's going to work
leaving me with a 2 by 3 matrix and this is exactly what we are doing when we are doing this this
elementary row operation so your elementary matrices start with the identity matrix and we're going to
apply an elementary row operation to it so let's do that so we have remember 1 and 0 and negative a
quarter and 1 and I'm going to multiply that by 4 minus 2 and 6 and a 1 and a 3 and a 5 so that I can get
this matrix one two three columns one two two rows and three columns so it ends up as two by three
exactly what I want so just look at what happens if I take this one and multiply by this it's four
plus zero is four that's minus two that's six it leaves that first row absolutely where it needs to
be and that is what we would have done if we did if we just did the elementary row operation in the
second one let's do this minus a quarter so that gives me minus one plus one is zero which is exactly
what I want minus a quarter times minus two that's a half plus three that's three and a half that leaves
me seven over two and minus a quarter times six so let's just do that minus six over four and that gives
minus six over four plus five and five that's 20 over four that gives me 14 over four that gives me
seven over two so seven over two and that is exactly what we would have done if we had just done normal
row operations here and what we did in actual fact is create an elementary matrix from the identity matrix by
doing exactly to it what we would have done with gauss-jordan elimination here we had one of the
elementary row operations minus a quarter times row one plus row two and that's exactly what we do to the
identity matrix and we multiply it so now we sit with the following matrix we have four minus two
and six and zero and seven over two and seven over two how would we what would we do in the following
way as i said i don't like fractions but to create these now these elementary elementary matrices are not
going to be they're not going to be unique you can do a variety of things here you don't have to follow
the exact same steps so if you follow other steps your elementary matrices will look different but
what i would do here is just multiply row two by multiply row two by two over seven that will give
me a one and a one so that i have a leading one here which is what i want so if again if i start with
the identity matrix if i were to start with the identity matrix and i multiply row two by two over seven
that'll give me my second one so that's still a one and a zero and i multiply by two over seven that's
zero there and two over seven there that's my e2 and let's do that let's now do e2
times this e1a
and we have zero one zero two over seven and we have our matrix there four minus two and six and zero
and seven over two and seven over two and what are we going to get exactly the same in the first row
and here we're going to get zero one one as i multiply these and these i get zero one one so there's my new
matrix let's just clean the board here a little bit let's just clean the board here a little bit so
now we're left with four minus two and six and zero one one now we can already do back substitution
because this says four times x minus two y equals six and one y equals one so y equals one and it's
exactly there i can plug that in and i can solve that but let's carry on let's carry on with these let's
just clean the board a little bit more there we go a bit more space so what would i do to this i
to get a leading one here i would multiply row one by a quarter so that's a quarter times row one let's
do exactly that to the identity matrix which gives me three which is a quarter zero zero one and let's do
this e3 then times my e3 times my e2 e1 a and let's do that so that it's going to be a quarter zero zero
one and i'm multiplying it by four minus two six and then zero one one that gives me a one that gives me
minus a half and that gives me six over four which is three over two zero one one so that's where i am
at the moment let's put that there so that gives me one minus a half and three over two and all i need
to do i can stop here again with back substitute substitution but let's get to row reduced reduced row echelon
form and so what would i do to get rid of that half well i'll multiply row two so it's a half times
row two plus row one if i have a half times row two that will give me a half plus negative a half which
would give me a zero and that's what i want there and that is what my e4 is going to be so it's a half
times a half times a half times row two so that's a zero and a half so am i adding that to row one so
zero plus one so that's still a one and zero plus a half that's a half and at the bottom i have still
zero and one so let's do that on this side
so we're going to do e4 multiplied by this e3 e2 e1 a that i've got at the moment and that is
zero and oops that is one and a half one a half zero and one and we're going to multiply that by one
minus a half three over two zero one one let's do that one times one that leaves me with a one
one times negative a half plus a half negative half plus a half is zero and you have three over two
plus a half that's four over two that leaves me with two and here i still have zero one one
if i multiply this zero this one this still a one and there is my solution x equals two
and y equals one x equals two and y equals one so we know we are correct there so what we've done is
this creating the series of elementary matrices and those elementary matrices is just what i wanted to do
the elementary row operation i do to an identity matrix which i then multiply by a so if i were to get
this e4 e3 e2 e1 if i were to do that multiplication and multiply it by a i was going to get to reduced
row echelon form and it is these elementary elementary matrices that are going to be important we've already
seen they're important in solving systems of linear equations but they're also going to be
important when we do lu decomposition lower upper triangular decomposition of a matrix and that is
also used for solving these systems for getting the inverses of a matrix and and for getting to the
determinant of a matrix and we'll still discuss the determinant so hope you understand it is just
it's very intuitive what the elementary row operation we wanted to do is what we do to
the identity matrix to create this every every elementary operation the elementary matrix that
you see here is taking the identity matrix and applying an elementary row operation to it
please be careful when you do it in the beginning where the pitfalls are that you've got to be
aware is when i say a half times row two plus row one so a half times row two plus row one that means
i'm changing row one i'm changing row one leaving row two exactly where it was so just just be careful
what you do it's not like this is now zero and a half here it is one as i'm changing row one it's a
half times row two plus row one so it's a change of row one not of row two here was a change of row two
not row 1 a change of row two not row one change of row two not row one so just be careful which one you do
do this so do a few of those just to make absolutely sure that this is this is you know
that you do this correctly so that you do and it's only through practice that you're going to get
this right so say these are relatively pointless exercises on paper but most of you will have to
do that for your exams and it becomes important when we just want to have a look at LU decomposition
which is something we will do tomorrow we're going to use these elementary matrices
