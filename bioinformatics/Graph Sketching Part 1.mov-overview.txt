This video series explains how to sketch the graph of a function using derivatives, illustrated with the example \( f(x) = 3x - x^3 \). Here's a summary:

1. **Identify Discontinuities and Endpoints:**
   - No discontinuities exist for this function.
   - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( y \to +\infty \); as \( x \to +\infty \), \( y \to -\infty \).
   - X-intercepts are at \( x = -\sqrt{3}, 0, \sqrt{3} \). The Y-intercept is at \( (0,0) \).

2. **Calculate Turning Points:**
   - Find the first derivative: \( f'(x) = 3 - 3x^2 \).
   - Set \( f'(x) = 0 \) to find turning points: \( x = -1, 1 \).
   - Calculate y-values at these points: \( (-1, -2) \) and \( (1, 2) \).

3. **Determine Increasing/Decreasing Intervals:**
   - Divide the graph into intervals based on turning points.
   - Test values in each interval to determine slope:
     - For \( x < -1 \), \( f'(x) < 0 \) (decreasing).
     - For \( -1 < x < 1 \), \( f'(x) > 0 \) (increasing).
     - For \( x > 1 \), \( f'(x) < 0 \) (decreasing).

4. **Determine Concavity and Inflection Points:**
   - Find the second derivative: \( f''(x) = -6x \).
   - Set \( f''(x) = 0 \) to find inflection points: \( x = 0 \).
   - Test concavity:
     - For \( x < 0 \), \( f''(x) > 0 \) (concave up).
     - For \( x > 0 \), \( f''(x) < 0 \) (concave down).

5. **Sketch the Graph:**
   - Use identified points and characteristics to sketch:
     - Starts decreasing from \( (-\infty, +\infty) \).
     - Turns up at \( (-1, -2) \), peaks at \( (1, 2) \).
     - Inflection point at \( (0, 0) \) where concavity changes.
     - Ends decreasing to \( (+\infty, -\infty) \).

This text outlines a method for sketching the graph of a function using calculus, specifically first and second derivatives. The example given is \( f(x) = 3x - x^3 \).

1. **Step 1: Plot Discontinuities and Intercepts**
   - There are no discontinuities as the function is defined for all real numbers.
   - Endpoints at infinity show that as \( x \to -\infty \), \( y \to +\infty \) and as \( x \to +\infty \), \( y \to -\infty \).
   - X-intercepts are found by solving \( 3x - x^3 = 0 \), resulting in intercepts at \( x = -\sqrt{3}, 0, \sqrt{3} \). The Y-intercept is at \( (0, 0) \).

2. **Step 2: Determine Turning Points**
   - Calculate the first derivative: \( f'(x) = 3 - 3x^2 \).
   - Set \( f'(x) = 0 \) to find turning points: \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \).
   - Evaluate these in the original function to get coordinates of turning points: \( (-1, -2) \) and \( (1, 2) \).

3. **Step 3: Analyze Intervals Between Turning Points**
   - Divide the x-axis into intervals based on turning points: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 1) \), \( (1, +\infty) \).
   - Check the sign of \( f'(x) \) in each interval to determine if the function is increasing or decreasing:
     - \( x < -1 \): \( f'(-2) = -9 \) (decreasing)
     - \( -1 < x < 1 \): \( f'(0) = 3 \) (increasing)
     - \( x > 1 \): \( f'(3) = -24 \) (decreasing)

4. **Step 4: Determine Concavity and Inflection Points**
   - Calculate the second derivative: \( f''(x) = -6x \).
   - Set \( f''(x) = 0 \) to find inflection points: \( x = 0 \).
   - Evaluate at this point in the original function for coordinates of the inflection point: \( (0, 0) \).
   - Check concavity:
     - \( x < 0 \): \( f''(-1) = 6 \) (concave up)
     - \( x > 0 \): \( f''(1) = -6 \) (concave down)

By following these steps, you can sketch the graph of \( f(x) = 3x - x^3 \), showing its behavior at infinity, intercepts, turning points, and changes in concavity.
