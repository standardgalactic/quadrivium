There is one more important property of logarithms that we have not discussed yet.
And it goes as follows. If you have the log base a of b, you can express that in a different way.
You can express it as log c of b divided by log base c of a.
So you might be given an example of the log base 3 of 4 and you need to express that literally.
And your calculator won't have that function. So you could rewrite that as log base 10 of 4 divided by log base 10 of 3.
Which your calculator would be able to do. You could also write this as log base Euler's number of 4 divided by log base Euler's number of 3.
And that would equal the natural log of 4 divided by the natural log of 3.
