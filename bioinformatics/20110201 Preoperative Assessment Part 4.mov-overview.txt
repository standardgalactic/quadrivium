The text discusses two main areas of perioperative risk assessment: cardiovascular and pulmonary risks. 

### Cardiovascular Risk Assessment:
- The revised cardiac risk index includes factors like high-risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-requiring diabetes, and serum creatinine levels.
- Beta blocker therapy is highlighted for its role in reducing mortality in patients with significant cardiovascular risks, particularly those over 65 or with coronary artery disease and other risk factors.
- The POISE trial indicated increased perioperative morbidity with beta blockers. Current practice advises maintaining existing beta blocker therapy while initiating it one to two weeks prior to surgery for vascular procedures.

### Pulmonary Risk Assessment:
- Pulmonary complications are noted as being more common and severe than cardiovascular ones, significantly affecting long-term morbidity and mortality.
- The ASA classification is a strong predictor of pulmonary complications, with an ASA score of 2 or higher indicating increased risk.
- Common pulmonary complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchospasm, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and exacerbation of pre-existing lung disease.

### Key Points in Pulmonary Risk:
- A comprehensive approach to pulmonary risk involves evaluation before anesthesia, during intubation, intraoperatively, and postoperatively.
- Screening includes patient history, clinical examination, direct observation of physical activity tolerance, chest X-rays, and spirometry for patients with known lung disease or symptoms.
- Arterial blood gases can assess preoperative hypoxia but aren't typically a surgery contraindication.
- Renal function and nutritional status are predictors of pulmonary complications, with low albumin levels indicating increased risk due to decreased hydrostatic pressure and reserve.

### COPD as a Risk Factor:
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant predictor of postoperative pulmonary complications.
- Up to 28% of patients with COPD may develop complications; spirometry and preoperative optimization, including bronchodilators and steroids for those with peak flow less than 80%, are crucial.

### Additional Recommendations:
- Preoperative physiotherapy, incentive spirometry, and lung expansion maneuvers can help reduce pulmonary risks. 

This summary underscores the importance of evaluating both cardiovascular and pulmonary risks in surgical patients, emphasizing specific interventions and assessments to minimize complications.
