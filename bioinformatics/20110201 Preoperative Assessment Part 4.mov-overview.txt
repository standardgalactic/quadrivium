The text discusses two main areas of perioperative risk assessment: cardiovascular and pulmonary risks. 

### Cardiovascular Risk Assessment:
- The revised cardiac risk index includes factors like high-risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-requiring diabetes, and serum creatinine levels.
- Beta blocker therapy is highlighted for its role in reducing mortality in patients with significant cardiovascular risks, particularly those over 65 or with coronary artery disease and other risk factors.
- The POISE trial indicated increased perioperative morbidity with beta blockers. Current practice advises maintaining existing beta blocker therapy while initiating it one to two weeks prior to surgery for vascular procedures.

### Pulmonary Risk Assessment:
- Pulmonary complications are noted as being more common and severe than cardiovascular ones, significantly affecting long-term morbidity and mortality.
- The ASA classification is a strong predictor of pulmonary complications, with an ASA score of 2 or higher indicating increased risk.
- Common pulmonary complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchospasm, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and exacerbation of pre-existing lung disease.

### Key Points in Pulmonary Risk:
- A comprehensive approach to pulmonary risk involves evaluation before anesthesia, during intubation, intraoperatively, and postoperatively.
- Screening includes patient history, clinical examination, direct observation of physical activity tolerance, chest X-rays, and spirometry for patients with known lung disease or symptoms.
- Arterial blood gases can assess preoperative hypoxia but aren't typically a surgery contraindication.
- Renal function and nutritional status are predictors of pulmonary complications, with low albumin levels indicating increased risk due to decreased hydrostatic pressure and reserve.

### COPD as a Risk Factor:
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant predictor of postoperative pulmonary complications.
- Up to 28% of patients with COPD may develop complications; spirometry and preoperative optimization, including bronchodilators and steroids for those with peak flow less than 80%, are crucial.

### Additional Recommendations:
- Preoperative physiotherapy, incentive spirometry, and lung expansion maneuvers can help reduce pulmonary risks. 

This summary underscores the importance of evaluating both cardiovascular and pulmonary risks in surgical patients, emphasizing specific interventions and assessments to minimize complications.

The text discusses the evaluation of cardiovascular and pulmonary risks in medical patients, particularly concerning surgery. It highlights two main areas:

1. **Cardiovascular Risk:**
   - The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a common tool used to assess risk, taking into account factors such as high-risk surgeries, history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-requiring diabetes, and serum creatinine levels.
   - Beta blocker therapy has been historically considered beneficial for reducing mortality in patients with significant cardiovascular risks. However, recent findings from the POISE trial suggest an increased perioperative morbidity risk, particularly strokes, associated with beta blockers. Current practice advises maintaining beta blockers for those already on them and starting them 1-2 weeks prior to vascular surgery, but not initiating them for other surgeries unless necessary.

2. **Pulmonary Risk:**
   - Pulmonary complications are more common (2.6 times) and potentially more severe than cardiac complications.
   - The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification is a strong predictor of pulmonary complications, with ASA 2 or greater indicating an increased risk.
   - Common pulmonary issues include pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchospasm, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and exacerbation of pre-existing lung diseases.
   - Preoperative assessments should focus on history-taking, clinical examination, observation of physical activity tolerance, chest X-rays, spirometry for patients with known pulmonary disease or symptoms, and considering arterial blood gas results to evaluate preoperative hypoxia without contraindicating surgery.
   - COPD is a significant risk factor for post-operative pulmonary complications, affecting up to 28% of patients. Preoperative optimization may include bronchodilators, short courses of steroids, and physiotherapy with incentive spirometry.

Overall, both cardiovascular and pulmonary assessments are crucial in pre-surgical evaluations, with particular emphasis on managing identified risks through specific therapeutic interventions.
