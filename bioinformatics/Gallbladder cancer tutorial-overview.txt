In the "Let's Talk Surgery" discussion, gallbladder carcinoma is highlighted as one of the most common cancers within the biliary tree in certain regions. It predominantly affects older adults and females. Typically, patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to rapid local invasion and spread through venous and lymphatic systems, leading to obstructive jaundice and often making surgical resection impossible. Consequently, management focuses on palliative care, such as biliary drainage.

Risk factors for gallbladder cancer include the presence of gallstones (though most with gallstones do not develop cancer), porcelain gallbladder (calcification of the gallbladder wall), adenomatous polyps, sclerosing cholangitis, and infections like salmonella in certain regions. Helicobacter pylori may also be a risk factor.

Symptoms preceding diagnosis often include biliary colic or similar symptoms from cholelithiasis (gallstones). In rare cases, an incidental finding during surgery for acute cholecystitis reveals early gallbladder cancer, which might not require further treatment if margins are clear. For advanced cases, comprehensive imaging and procedures like ERCPs or PTCs help determine surgical feasibility, but even with resection, prognosis remains poor, typically with less than six months survival post-diagnosis. Management in tertiary centers is crucial for appropriate care.
