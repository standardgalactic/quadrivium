So let's have a look at substrings. So I'm going to introduce this new computer variable called
str underscore subset just by my choice and inside of it I'm going to put the string
I love Julia exclamation mark I use the semicolon so it does not there's no output to the screen
first things first let's count the number of characters in our little string and we use we've
seen this before the length function and inside of that the argument is this computer variable str
underscore subset if we run that we see there are 13 and indeed if we count it we notice that we have
to count the spaces so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 13 characters now let's do a little loop just
so that we can see what happens now what I'm going to do here let's bring that up a little bit I'm
going to say for i in 1 to the length of str underscore subset that means 13 so for i in 1 to 13 so it's
going to loop through 1 2 3 4 until we get 13 print the following the following that I wanted to print
is a string and the string says character and then it is this placeholder dollar i so the first thing
is going to say character 1 the next next time it loops is going to say character 2 and then is
space colon space then a tab remember this column this comma concatenates all of this into one
this is a tab so that is code for a tab comma and then the subset string subset i now this is
notation for the index of that so this i love julia exclamation mark each and every character in that
sentence has an index and then comma we're going to have this is a new line so i just told you there
the comma concatenates the whole the commas concatenate the whole lot the backslash t is a tab and the
backslash n is a new line let's execute that so we're going to see what happens and indeed there
we go so it says character 1 is an i character 2 is a space so space counts and that's how we get
to 13 with the exclamation mark so we've seen this index thing let's let's slice things up a bit
so i've still got this computer variable string str underscore subset and i want from index 1 to 6 so
note these are square brackets and 1 to 6 and that is i love so it's 1 2 spaces 2 3 4 5 6 1 to 6
those characters let's see what happens if we take 8 till the end i know the end is 13 but in case you
didn't know what the length of your string was you could just use end so 8 to end was just going to be
julia exclamation mark let's reverse the order that's a bit of fun so this says go from end
to the first one but go back in steps of negative one so we're going to take our string and just
reverse it and that's quite clever i think that's quite clever so i love julia exclamation mark all in
reverse now just note the following just in case you do run into this let's uh correct that spelling
mistake there that looks a lot better now note if we just use one just going to the index one which
is just going to be i and see it has single quotation marks versus if i say one to one i'm going to get
the double quotation marks now we're going to look at this a bit later the single quotation marks
refers to this as a character a certain character and this is just part of a string by the double
quotation marks later on we'll see these single quotation marks they are all about characters
and that is up next
