The text discusses the refraction of light and how its speed changes when traveling through different materials. In a vacuum, light travels at 299,800 km/s (denoted as C), but it slows down in mediums like water or air due to absorption and re-emission by atoms.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Speed of Light in Materials**: 
   - The speed is reduced in materials compared to a vacuum.
   - This reduction is quantified using the absolute index of refraction, calculated as C divided by the velocity of light in that material.

2. **Index of Refraction**:
   - The relative index compares two materials and involves dividing their absolute indices of refraction or their respective light velocities.

3. **Snell's Law**: 
   - Describes how a ray bends when it passes between materials with different indices of refraction: \( N_I \sin(\theta_I) = N_T \sin(\theta_T) \).
   - The angle changes depending on whether the light moves to a material with higher or lower refractive index.

4. **Refraction and Reflection**:
   - Refraction causes bending towards the normal if entering a denser medium (higher refraction index), and away from it in a rarer medium.
   - Not all light is refracted; some is reflected, especially at certain critical angles leading to total internal reflection when \( N_I > N_T \).

5. **Critical Angle**:
   - The angle where the refracted ray travels along the boundary between two media (\(\theta_T = 90^\circ\)), only possible if \( N_I > N_T \).

6. **Reflection Angles**: 
   - Reflect like a mirror, with incident and reflected angles being equal.

7. **Prism**:
   - Demonstrates dispersion by refracting different colors at different angles due to varying indices of refraction (e.g., blue light more than red).

8. **Terminology Clarification**:
   - "Incident" refers to the incoming ray, not specifically internal or external reflection.

Understanding these principles is crucial for solving problems related to light behavior in various media.

The text explains concepts related to the behavior of light at an interface between two materials. It distinguishes between terms like "incident" and "transmitted." The "incident" refers to light moving towards the interface, while the "transmitted" describes light that passes through and moves away from the plane of the interface. Additionally, it clarifies that some rays cross the plane of the interface but move in a direction away from it. This explanation is intended to prevent confusion regarding how light behaves at these boundaries.
