The text provides an introduction to modeling free undamped motion using a linear differential equation with constant coefficients. It describes a scenario involving a mass attached to a spring, oscillating up and down without any external forces like friction or air resistance. This idealized model assumes that the mass can indefinitely continue its motion.

To construct this model, it uses Hooke's Law, which states that the restoring force in a spring is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, introducing a constant \( k \) (the spring constant). Newton's second law (\( F = ma \)) is also used. By considering forces at equilibrium and when displaced, the text derives the equation of motion for the mass-spring system as:

\[ m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0 \]

This simplifies to a homogeneous second-order linear differential equation by dividing through by the mass \( m \), resulting in:

\[ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0 \]

where \( \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \) and \( \omega \) represents the angular frequency of oscillation. The solution to this equation is given by a combination of sine and cosine functions:

\[ x(t) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t) \]

The period of oscillation, which is the time it takes for one complete cycle of motion, is \( T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \). The frequency (how many cycles occur per second) is then \( f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \).

This model helps predict the position of the mass at any given time \( t \) and highlights the relationship between the spring constant, mass, and oscillatory motion's characteristics.

The text describes a basic physics model of free undamped motion, focusing on a mass-spring system without external forces like friction or air resistance. This theoretical setup involves a mass hanging from a spring and oscillating up and down when displaced slightly.

Key points include:

1. **Model Description**: The system is represented by a linear second-order differential equation with constant coefficients, assuming no external force acting on it. 

2. **Initial Conditions**: At time \( t = 0 \), the position of the mass (\( y_0 \)) and its initial velocity are specified.

3. **Hooke's Law**: The restoring force of the spring is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, with a constant \( k \) (spring constant).

4. **Equilibrium Condition**: At equilibrium, gravitational force \( mg \) equals the spring force \( ks \), leading to \( mg = ks \).

5. **Oscillation and Differential Equation**: When displaced further, a new restoring force arises. Using Newton's second law (\( F = ma \)), an equation for undamped motion is derived: 
   \[
   m x'' + kx = 0
   \]
   Simplified to:
   \[
   x'' + \omega^2 x = 0
   \]
   where \( \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \).

6. **Solution**: The general solution involves trigonometric functions: 
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t)
   \]

7. **Oscillation Period and Frequency**: The period \( T \) of oscillation is given by:
   \[
   T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
   \]
   and the frequency \( f \) is:
   \[
   f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}
   \]

This model illustrates how a mass-spring system can exhibit periodic motion, with its characteristics determined by the spring constant and the mass.
