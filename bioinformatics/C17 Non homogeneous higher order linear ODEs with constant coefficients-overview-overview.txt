The text describes the method of undetermined coefficients for solving non-homogeneous linear higher-order ordinary differential equations using a superposition approach. This technique applies when the right-hand side function \( g(x) \) is of specific forms such as constants, polynomials, sine or cosine functions, exponential functions like \( e^{\alpha x} \), or finite sums/products thereof. The method relies on guessing the particular solution based on \( g(x)'s\) form.

This approach works because derivatives of these specific function types maintain a similar structure (e.g., polynomials remain polynomials, and sine/cosine transform into each other). However, it is not suitable for transcendental functions like \( \ln(x) \), \( 1/x \), or tangent functions, whose derivatives do not preserve the original form.

To solve an equation using this method, first find the complementary solution by solving the associated homogeneous equation (setting \( g(x) = 0 \)) using known methods. The superposition approach is then used to determine the particular solution for the non-homogeneous part. Combining these solutions gives the general solution of the original differential equation.
