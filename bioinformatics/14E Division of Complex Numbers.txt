Now that we've seen how to multiply complex numbers, we're going to look at dividing complex numbers, the division of complex numbers. To do that, though, it's not as simple as multiplication, we have to develop this idea of a complex conjugate.
What is the definition of complex conjugate? Well, if we view a complex number as an orbit pair with our real axis and our imaginary axis, so this is in R2 space, if we view it as a vector, so that will be a comma b, and this vector is going to be a plus bi, our vector there.
We reflect that vector along the real axis. So we reflect it along the real axis, which leaves there, and if this was our vector, or our complex number z, and we made a vector in R2 space of it, this would be our complex conjugate, or otherwise known as our conjugate, and we write it as the z with a bar across it.
So, if our complex number z equals a plus bi, our complex conjugate, or just simply known as the conjugate, would be a plus, we make that negative bi, that negative.
So we're talking about the negative, or not, we shouldn't say negative, we multiply it by negative 1, so if that was 3 minus 4i, we're multiplied by negative 1.
Okay, so it's multiplied by negative 1. That's what's happening to the b, and that is the imaginary part of z gets multiplied by negative 1.
So we're reflecting along the real axis. So if I have some examples, if I have z equal to 3 minus 4i, then the conjugate of z is going to be 3 plus 4i.
If I have z equals 4, remember that's plus 0i, so z with a bar on top of the conjugate of z is going to be 4 as well.
So that is the notion of a complex conjugate, and we're going to use that. We're going to do one more concept, and then we'll combine these two concepts, and we'll do division of complex numbers.
As far as the second concept we're looking at is the modulus of a complex number.
Now, that is also, or let me, let's first say what it means. If you view a complex number as a vector, it is the norm of that vector.
It's the norm of the vector of a complex number in R2 space.
Okay? And remember, if we had a vector v, the norm of vector v we would write as this, but we write this modulus, the modulus of z, we just write that as z, just with an absolute value.
And you'll see why we write an absolute value sine. So it's the length of that, and it's very easy to do.
If my z was a plus bi, the modulus of z becomes, or z becomes, the square root of a squared plus b squared.
So it's just that length. And what if I told you z equals negative 1?
So that would be plus 0i. So what would the modulus of z be?
Well, negative 1 would just lie there. If this was 1, negative 1, negative 2, that would be negative 1.
And its length is 1. Length is not negative.
In other words, the modulus would be a squared, the modulus would be negative 1 squared plus 0 squared, the square root of that, that would just be 1.
In other words, z equals negative 1, the modulus of just a number, the modulus of just that number, is going to be the absolute value of that number, which gives us 1.
So the concept of modulus.
Okay, the mess of rains have started in Cape Town. It's turning towards winter.
So lots of rain outside, dark and gloomy sky.
Well, we need the rain, so let it rain.
Now, we're into due division.
To do division, though, I need to show you this.
If I have any complex number z, and I multiply by its conjugate,
and I multiply by its conjugate, what am I going to get?
Well, make that a plus b i,
and then its conjugate, its complex conjugates a minus b i,
so I'm going to get an a squared,
I'm going to get a negative b squared,
because plus a b i, negative a b i, those will cancel.
And I'm going to get a positive b i, b squared, i squared,
I already level it, minus b squared,
by i squared, I shouldn't forget,
which is a squared plus b squared,
the following story.
Okay, multiplying those out,
you see that a squared plus b squared,
and if you remember that
the modulus of z equals the square root of a squared plus b squared,
that means
this must, if I square this,
that is going to equal,
if I square this, that is going to equal a squared plus b squared,
getting rid of that,
so if I square this side as well,
okay,
so this is nothing other than the modulus squared.
So now I'm going to do division.
So I'm going to have z1 divided by z2,
and I can get to an equation how to do this,
so my new z is going to be z1 divided by z2,
doing division of complex numbers.
if I multiply both the numerator and the denominator
by z2 complex conjugate of z2,
so I'm multiplying by 1,
I'm not changing anything,
this leaves me with
z1,
z2 complex conjugate,
and I have z2 times its conjugate,
complex number times its conjugate,
and that leaves me with,
that leaves me with this,
that leaves me with this,
that times that,
leaves me with that,
which is this,
so divided by z,
it's 2, remember,
2 squared.
And that is our equation for division
of complex numbers.
So all I did was just multiply,
the numerator and denominator,
by the complex conjugate of z2.
Those I write as it were,
as they were,
and we know that z times z,
which we have there,
z2 times z,
these two,
and giving you a squared,
because b squared of z2 itself,
which is otherwise known as
the modulus of z squared,
the modulus of z2 squared.
Example time,
always two examples,
you have better illustration
of what is going on.
Let's divide z plus 4i,
divide that by 1 minus 2i.
Complex,
two complex numbers,
division of this.
So remember what we said,
our equation that z is going to equal
z1 times z2,
z2 squared.
z2 squared.
So what are we going to do here?
This is going to equal z1.
Remember,
this is z1 and z2,
so this is z1,
that is 3 plus 4i.
And I'm going to multiply it
by the complex conjugate of z2,
which we now know is easy to do.
This is 1 plus 2i.
And I'm going to divide that by
the modulus of z2 squared.
And now remember,
that the modulus
equals the square root of a squared
plus b squared.
So the modulus of a complex number squared
is a squared plus b squared.
So I'm just going to divide that by
z2,
which is the denominator,
a squared and b squared.
So it's going to be 1 squared
plus negative 2 squared.
So what's that going to give me?
We've done multiplication
of two complex numbers,
which we just treat
as we would multiply
normal algebraic expressions.
So 3 times 1 is 3.
That'll be plus 6i.
That'll be another.
3 plus 2 is 6.
And then 4.
That'll be 4i
plus 8i squared
divided by
1 plus 4 is 5.
So we're going to get
this is going to be
negative 8.
Negative 8 plus 3
is negative 5.
We have 6i plus 4i
is plus 10i
divided by 5,
which is going to give me
negative 1 plus 2i.
Negative 1 plus 2i.
So very, very simple to do.
I know complex numbers
can also appear
in linear equations.
I have two equations
and two unknowns
in as much as I have
x and y.
But we have complex numbers
that appear
in our
set of linear equations
now, a linear set.
And we asked
to use Kramer's rule
to determine
the values of x and y.
First order of business,
always in mathematics.
You have to see
is it possible
to use Kramer's rule.
And we'll know
that Kramer's rule
says that the unknown,
let's call that unknown x,
equals the determinant
of A, let's make it,
there'll be a number
1, for instance,
divided by the determinant
of A.
The determinant of A.
So the determinant of A
is in the denominator.
We need to know
that that is not 0,
that the matrix of coefficients
is in the invertible.
So, we know
from A, x equals B,
a solution
using matrices
for our linear set,
we must set up,
we must set up
the matrix of coefficients.
Let's do that.
The matrix of coefficients
for us is going
to be I,
it's going to be
2,
these are 2,
did I do this right?
I and 2, yes,
and 4,
I just need to see
that I wrote this correctly,
4 and negative I.
That is my matrix.
Let's get the determinant
of that.
That's easy to do
with a 2 by 2 matrix.
We're just going
to say A minus D,
A times D
minus B times C.
So that is,
is that a negative I,
an I,
and a negative I,
yes, indeed.
So we are going
to get here
negative I squared
minus 8,
and that is going
to equal negative,
negative 1 minus 8,
that's 1 minus 8,
and that equals
negative 7.
So indeed,
first order of business,
yes, we can use
Schraber's rule,
because the determinant
of our matrix of coefficients
of our linear set
does not equal 0.
In other words,
A is invertible.
Now I have to set up
my two new matrices,
A1,
which is easy to do.
I'm going to replace
column 1 by my
column vector B,
which are the two
right-hand sides
of the two equations
in my linear set.
So that is going to be
1 minus 2I,
and we'll still have
the 2 on that side,
and we're going to have
negative 1 plus 3I,
and on that side,
we're still going
to have negative I.
So there is my,
there is my first,
my first new matrix,
and A2.
It's going to equal,
we're going to take
these first,
oops,
these first columns,
and 4,
and then the second column
I'm going to replace
now with the column
vector B,
1 minus 2I,
and minus 1 plus 3I.
That is my second vector,
and I need to get
the determinants
of both of these,
so let's do the
determinant of A1.
So it's going to be
negative,
I just need to make sure
which are 1's
and which are I's.
Negative 1 minus 2I
times I,
so I'm going to have
a negative I
minus,
times minus is positive,
2I squared,
which makes it
a negative 2I,
a negative 2 thing,
and as much as the I squared
is a negative 1.
Minus I minus 2,
and then I'm going to
subtract that
with the multiplication
of these two,
so it's actually then
minus 2 times this,
which is going to be
plus 2,
and negative 2,
that is a negative 6I.
So that's going to equal
negative 7I,
by simplifying
negative 7I on this side,
and the determinant
of A2,
so I'm doing it all
in writing out
all the steps,
write out all the steps,
make sure you then
make a mistake.
So I have I times
negative 1 plus 3I,
so that leaves me with
negative 2I,
and plus 3 times
I squared is
negative 3.
I'm going to subtract
that from negative,
negative,
the multiplication
of this,
so it's actually
negative 4 times 1
is negative 4,
and negative 4 times
negative 2
is positive 8,
positive 8I,
so that leaves me
with negative 7,
and it looks like
plus 7I.
So I can get X,
X is going to equal
the determinant
of A1,
which is negative 7I,
divided by
the determinant of A,
which was negative 7,
so X equals I,
and the
and the
Y would be
the determinant
of A2
divided by the
determinant of A,
so that's negative 7
plus 7I,
divided by negative 7,
that leaves me with
1 minus I.
And just a dimension
of number I
and the complex
number 1 minus,
1 minus I.
Easy to solve
using Kramer's rule.
