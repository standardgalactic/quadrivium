The text describes an alternative method for calculating the volume of a cylinder using double integrals, specifically by converting from Cartesian coordinates (xy-coordinate system) to polar coordinates. 

1. **Context and Setup**: The volume is considered between the base of the cylinder and a plane \( z = h \). In Cartesian coordinates, this involves integrating over a region bounded by the equation of a circle \( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \).

2. **Conversion to Polar Coordinates**:
   - In polar coordinates, any point in the xy-plane is represented as \((r, \theta)\), where \( r \) is the radius and \(\theta\) is the angle.
   - The infinitesimal area element changes from \( dx\,dy \) in Cartesian to \( r\,dr\,d\theta \) in polar coordinates. This change reflects how areas are calculated using small rectangles that have been transformed into sectors of circles.

3. **Integration Process**:
   - The radius \( r \) varies from 0 to the constant radius \( a \).
   - The angle \(\theta\) sweeps from 0 to \(2\pi\) to cover the entire circle.
   - Integrating over these bounds involves setting up the integral as follows: \(\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{a} r \, dr \, d\theta\).

4. **Calculation**:
   - The inner integral with respect to \(r\) is straightforward and results in \(\frac{1}{2} a^2\).
   - Integrating this result over \(\theta\) from 0 to \(2\pi\) gives the volume as \(\pi a^2 h\).

5. **Conclusion**: The text concludes by showing that converting to polar coordinates simplifies the integration process, ultimately yielding the familiar formula for the volume of a cylinder: \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. This demonstrates how changing coordinate systems can simplify the calculation of volumes using double integrals.

The text explains how to calculate the volume of a cylinder using double integrals by transitioning from Cartesian coordinates (xy-plane) to polar coordinates. In Cartesian terms, you typically integrate over a region bounded by \( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \), representing the circular base of the cylinder. The height is constant at \( h \).

When converting to polar coordinates:
- The radius \( r \) ranges from 0 to \( a \).
- The angle \( \theta \) sweeps from 0 to \( 2\pi \).

In polar coordinates, an infinitesimally small area element is represented as \( r \, dr \, d\theta \). To find the volume:
1. Set up the double integral with these limits: 
   - Inner integral for \( r \) from 0 to \( a \).
   - Outer integral for \( \theta \) from 0 to \( 2\pi \).

2. The integrand is simply \( h \), the constant height of the cylinder.

The integration proceeds as follows:
- Integrate with respect to \( r \): 
  \[
  \int_0^a r \, dr = \frac{1}{2} a^2
  \]

- Integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
  \[
  \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi
  \]

Combining these results gives the volume:
\[ 
V = h \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2} a^2\right) \cdot (2\pi) = \pi a^2 h 
\]
This confirms that using polar coordinates simplifies calculating the cylinder's volume, yielding the familiar formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \).
