The text explains the concept of row echelon form in matrices by outlining three main criteria for achieving this form:

1. Each non-zero row must start with a leading 1.
2. Rows containing only zeros should be positioned at the bottom of the matrix.
3. In successive rows, the leading 1s must shift further to the right as you move down.

An additional optional property is mentioned for reduced row echelon form: columns with a leading 1 should contain zeros in all other positions within that column. The example provided does not meet this criterion.

The text highlights that elementary row operations can be used to attain these properties fully. Once a matrix is in row echelon form, solutions to linear systems can be directly determined without needing back substitution, facilitating efficient problem-solving. Further exploration of the topic will continue in the next video.
