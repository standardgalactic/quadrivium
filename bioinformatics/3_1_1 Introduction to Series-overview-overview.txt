The text explains the concepts of sequences and series within mathematics. A **sequence** refers to an ordered list of elements, such as \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{6}, \ldots \). In contrast, a **series** is formed by taking the sum of these terms sequentially, resulting in partial sums like:

- \( s_1 = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( s_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)

These partial sums create a sequence themselves, representing the series. While sequences involve just listing elements without summation, series focus on their cumulative addition.

The text highlights an important distinction between these two concepts and discusses **convergence**. It examines whether the infinite terms of a sequence approach zero to determine if the series converges (i.e., approaches a finite limit) or diverges. Understanding this relationship is crucial for analyzing mathematical series and their properties.

In summary, sequences consist of individual elements, while series are formed by summing these elements into partial sums, with significant implications for studying convergence in mathematics.
