The text provides an explanation of solving a linear differential equation using the method of integrating factors. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Standard Form**: The equation is recognized as a standard form linear differential equation because it includes a first derivative with respect to \(x\), has constant coefficients, and no explicit function of \(x\) in the non-homogeneous term (\(f(x) = 0\)).

2. **Identifying Components**:
   - The coefficient of \(y'\) is 1.
   - The equation can be written as \( y' - 3y = 0 \).
   - Here, \( p(x) = -3 \), which is constant, and \( f(x) = 0 \).

3. **Interval**: The solution is valid over the interval from negative to positive infinity because the coefficients are continuous everywhere.

4. **Integrating Factor**:
   - The integrating factor is calculated as \( e^{\int p(x) \, dx} = e^{-3x} \).
   - This factor simplifies solving the differential equation by transforming it into an exact differential form.

5. **Transformation and Solution**:
   - Multiplying through by the integrating factor results in: 
     \[
     e^{-3x} y' - 3e^{-3x} y = 0
     \]
   - This can be recognized as the derivative of \( (e^{-3x} y) \).
   - Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), you find:
     \[
     e^{-3x} y = C
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \) gives the family of solutions: 
     \[
     y = Ce^{3x}
     \]

6. **Homogeneous Nature**: The equation is homogeneous since it equals zero, meaning there are no particular solutions separate from the complementary solution.

The text concludes by emphasizing that this approach results in a general solution for such linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

The text provides an explanation of solving a linear differential equation using an integrating factor. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Form**: The standard form of a linear differential equation is introduced, where \( \frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = f(x) \). In this example, \( p(x) = -3 \) and \( f(x) = 0 \), making it a homogeneous linear differential equation.

2. **Integrating Factor**: The integrating factor is calculated as \( e^{\int -3 \, dx} = e^{-3x} \). This factor simplifies the process of solving the differential equation.

3. **Multiplying by Integrating Factor**: Multiplying the entire differential equation by this integrating factor transforms it into an exact derivative form: \( \frac{d}{dx}(e^{-3x}y) = 0 \).

4. **Integration**: By integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), the solution is obtained as \( e^{-3x}y = C \), where \( C \) is a constant.

5. **Solution Form**: Solving for \( y \), the family of solutions is given by \( y = Ce^{3x} \).

6. **Homogeneous Equation**: Since the equation is homogeneous (i.e., \( f(x) = 0 \)), there is no particular solution (\( y_p \)), and the general solution consists only of the complementary function (\( y_c \)).

The text emphasizes understanding the role of the integrating factor in simplifying the process of solving linear differential equations.
