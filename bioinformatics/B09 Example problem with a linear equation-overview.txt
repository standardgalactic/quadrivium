The text provides an explanation of solving a linear differential equation using the method of integrating factors. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Standard Form**: The equation is recognized as a standard form linear differential equation because it includes a first derivative with respect to \(x\), has constant coefficients, and no explicit function of \(x\) in the non-homogeneous term (\(f(x) = 0\)).

2. **Identifying Components**:
   - The coefficient of \(y'\) is 1.
   - The equation can be written as \( y' - 3y = 0 \).
   - Here, \( p(x) = -3 \), which is constant, and \( f(x) = 0 \).

3. **Interval**: The solution is valid over the interval from negative to positive infinity because the coefficients are continuous everywhere.

4. **Integrating Factor**:
   - The integrating factor is calculated as \( e^{\int p(x) \, dx} = e^{-3x} \).
   - This factor simplifies solving the differential equation by transforming it into an exact differential form.

5. **Transformation and Solution**:
   - Multiplying through by the integrating factor results in: 
     \[
     e^{-3x} y' - 3e^{-3x} y = 0
     \]
   - This can be recognized as the derivative of \( (e^{-3x} y) \).
   - Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), you find:
     \[
     e^{-3x} y = C
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \) gives the family of solutions: 
     \[
     y = Ce^{3x}
     \]

6. **Homogeneous Nature**: The equation is homogeneous since it equals zero, meaning there are no particular solutions separate from the complementary solution.

The text concludes by emphasizing that this approach results in a general solution for such linear differential equations with constant coefficients.
