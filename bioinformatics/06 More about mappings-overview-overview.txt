The text clarifies key concepts related to mathematical mappings, focusing on distinctions between domain, range (or image), and co-domain, as well as specific types of mappings such as onto mappings, bijections, and inverse mappings:

1. **Domain and Co-Domain**: The domain is the set from which elements originate in a mapping process, while the co-domain is the potential set of outputs. For instance, when natural numbers (\(n\)) are mapped to \(n+2\), the co-domain includes all natural numbers, but the range excludes 1 and 2 since no input maps to these values.

2. **Range**: The range (or image) consists of actual outputs obtained from mapping elements of the domain. In our example, it is every natural number except 1 and 2.

3. **Onto Mapping**: A function is onto (surjective) if each element in the co-domain has at least one corresponding element in the domain that maps to it.

4. **Bijection**: This mapping is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto), meaning every element of the co-domain corresponds uniquely to an element in the domain, ensuring a perfect pairing between the two sets.

5. **Inverse Mapping**: A bijective function has an inverse, enabling a unique reverse mapping from the co-domain back to the domain. This property is crucial as it ensures that bijections have well-defined inverses.

6. **Composition of Mappings**: When combining mappings (e.g., \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)), their composition (\(\beta\alpha\) or \(\alpha\beta\)) means applying one after another, with the sequence affecting the outcome.

The text concludes by mentioning a theorem that bijective functions have unique inverses, setting the stage for further exploration of these properties in exercises.

The text provides an overview of fundamental concepts related to mathematical mappings:

1. **Domain and Co-Domain**: The domain is the set of inputs for a function, while the co-domain is the potential set of outputs. For instance, when mapping natural numbers \(n\) to \(n+2\), the domain is natural numbers, but the range excludes 1 and 2, even though the co-domain includes all natural numbers.

2. **Range**: The range (or image) consists only of the actual outputs produced by applying the function to elements in the domain. In the example given, it includes all natural numbers except 1 and 2.

3. **Onto Mapping**: A function is onto if every element in the co-domain corresponds to at least one input from the domain.

4. **Bijection**: This type of mapping is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto), ensuring a perfect pairing between elements of the domain and co-domain, with each pair being unique.

5. **Inverse Mapping**: A bijective function has an inverse that allows for a unique reverse mapping from the co-domain back to the domain, highlighting the significance of bijections in guaranteeing inverses.

6. **Composition of Mappings**: The composition of two mappings involves applying one after the other, with order affecting the result (\(\beta\alpha\) or \(\alpha\beta\)).

The text concludes by mentioning a theorem that bijective functions possess unique inverses, suggesting further exploration through exercises.
