We are told that an electron has the following velocity, it has the following velocity, 2.0
times 10 to the power 6 meters per second in the I direction, that's unit vector, so that's in the X direction, plus 3.0, 3.0 times 10 to the power 6 meters per second in the J direction, J roof.
It moves through a uniform magnetic field, so it's a uniform magnetic field, and we have that as 0.03 tesla I, and we have negative 0.15 tesla in the J direction.
Those are our two vectors, find the force on the electron. Very simply, we know that force is going to equal qv, plus b, and what we can do, qv is easy to get, we can just multiply each of these by 1.6 times 10 to the power negative 19 coulomb, times 1.6 times 10 to the power negative 19 coulomb, but we're dealing with an electron moves through there, so it's going to be negative and negative.
And how do we do this? How do we do this cost product? Very easily. Now we have, we just have two columns in this vector, two column vector for b, so very simply we're going to have,
f is going to have, f is going to equal, this value, times this value, minus this value, times this value. I'm not going to go into vector, how to do vector cross products, but this is just a square matrix that we have here, so it's this value, times this value, minus this value, times this value, which is simply going to give us a thing,
I put down the answer, I put down the answer somewhere, not here with me, but that's certainly easy to get. If it was a proton, we would have multiplied this with positive and positive,
those two values, those two values, those two values, so we have new values there and there, and it's still going to be this times this, minus this times this, so we're going to get a different force.
Let's do a problem with much more difficult vector multiplication. We have a proton that moves through a uniform magnetic field and the magnetic field is such,
at the times this, which is just, the nine we want to give you this k沒有is nuestras flανASSEWhen a singleción bild jan glилась就e dela.
It has such a fact that, which are tgr to this controller, that's a empirical bag, because of tgr to this LLC, that's a 사� icham眾 straante,
and then minus p, so we have a particle of 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 10 to the next V,
the channel of 22 minus 30 to the power of 10 to the power of flexible tesla, so that will be i,
So there will be I roof, J roof, K roof.
At time T, the proton has a velocity of Vx meters per second, I roof.
It has Vy meters per second, J roof, and it has 2,000 meters per second, K roof.
And the magnitude of the force on it, that specific time, due to the magnetic field,
was 4.0 times 10 to the power of negative 17 newtons in the I direction,
and 2.0 times 10 to the power of negative 17 newtons in the J direction.
At that instant, what is Vx velocity in the X direction, and what is the velocity in the Y direction?
So this becomes a bit more complex, and I'm just going to explain it in a long fashion.
Remember, we still have the fact that F of P equals QB cross P.
I can multiply this by Q, and I think it was said by a proton.
A proton.
So I can multiply Vx, so this is going to become 1.6 times 10 to the power of negative 19 Coulomb Vx.
1.6 times 10 to the power of negative 19 Vx Coulomb meters per second.
I can multiply this by 1.6 times 10 to the power of negative 19 Coulomb as well.
Now, how does this work?
We have a vector here with three columns, another vector with three columns,
and how are we going to get to this?
Remember, if we're going to multiply the vectors with each other,
this should actually be the other way around, and it's V cross B.
So V has got to be up there, so let me do that.
That is going to be 1.6 times 10 to the power of negative 19 Vx in the I direction.
This is going to be 1.6 times 10 to the power of negative 19 Vy in the J direction,
and multiply 1.6, so that's going to be 3.2 times 10 to the power of negative 16,
and that's going to be in the K direction.
Okay.
It's V cross B, so very important if you have to write V on top.
And now, very simply, how do we do vector multiplication here?
For the Vb, x, which is 4.0 times 10 to the power of negative 17 Newtons,
it's going to equal, we close our first column,
so it's going to be that one times that one minus this one times this one.
So, it's going to be 1.6 times 10 to the power of negative 19 Vx times 30 times 10 to the power of negative 3,
divided by minus this one times this one.
So, 3.2 times 10 to the power of negative 16 times negative 20 times 10 to the power of negative 3.
So, that becomes very simple.
We have an equation, we have one unknown, we can solve for that one unknown.
Same goes for if we want to get Vbj.
That is going to be 2.0 times 10 to the power of negative 17 Newtons.
And that's very simply going to be, for the second one, we close this.
But remember, when we do multiplication, that is going to be a negative.
Before we start anything.
And we close the second column, so it's still going to be that, multiplied by that.
And minus this, multiplied by that.
We've closed off this column.
That one multiplied by that one, minus this one, multiplied by this one.
But remember, we have a negative in front for our second, the second row in our vector answer.
And I think for the third one, what you can do, um...
I made a mistake.
Very stupid.
It must be, and I'm going to leave this in the video, because you must be very careful.
Remember, for the first one, 4.0, we close our first column.
So it's 1.6 times 10 to the power of negative 19 Vy.
Times 3 minus...
3.2 times minus 20.
So don't make a mistake there.
Now we're going to get the x value, because we close this off.
We have our minus, there's 1.6, 10 to the power of negative 19 Vx.
Times that, minus those two, and then we'll get an answer for Vx.
Also very simple, uh... simple algebra.
So this is how you do multiplication of vectors.
And remember, we were given the answers.
And that's where I noticed my mistake.
Then for the third one, if we then have values for Vx and Vy,
we close the third one.
If we did this multiplication minus this multiplication,
we should get to zero, because we had no...
It's plus zero...
on the K vector.
So you can just check.
Indeed, it's a beautiful problem inasmuch as you can check
whether your answers for Vx and Vy were correct.
In the next video or so, I just want to discuss the cross-field effect.
And that's when a charged particle moves through a field,
an area that contains both an electric and a magnetic field.
And that actually had to do with the discovery of the electron.
If we had charged two plates here,
and one is at higher potential than the other,
and we have a charged particle with a velocity V
going through that charge over through those plates,
we know that it's going to experience a force,
and a force due to the electric field,
and vector form is just going to be Q times that electric field.
So, if the electric field is now in this direction, E,
we know that there's going to be a force
on this charge particle sets in electron in this direction.
If we look, though, at a magnetic field,
and imagine there's a magnetic field going into the blackboard.
So, we have velocity times velocity in this direction,
cross-product of the V in that direction,
we're going to have a force V in the upwards direction.
Here, we're going to have the electron going with the electric field,
with the electric field,
so its force is going to go in this direction.
So, we can actually set up the electric field
and the magnetic field such that there is no net movement,
and this particle just goes straight on.
There's one or two equations I just want to have a look at.
In Chapter 2 of Electricity,
we just had to look at the length of these plates,
and we said that the deflection that we can find,
Y, I think was Q,
I'm just going to write it down so we don't make a mistake,
E, length squared, divided by 2MV squared.
That was going to be our deflection in the Y direction.
If we adjust these two fields,
that they do cancel out,
we're going to have that the F of E equals,
or the F of the electric field plus the magnetic field
is going to equal zero,
and what we're actually just going to have is that
Q, E,
which is what this is,
is going to equal Q VB sine of phi.
Sine of phi,
so we're actually just going to have,
and then the velocities in this direction,
the magnetic field,
so this is 90 degrees,
so we can leave that out,
and we're actually just going to have that
V equals E divided by B.
And if we substitute that V in here,
we're going to get to what was discovered by Rutherford,
that the mass of charge,
the magnitude of charge of this particle
that he discovered was going to be B squared,
L squared, divided by 2YE.
He could know the magnetic field strength,
he could know the length of the plates
through which his charge particles were going,
he could measure the deflection,
and he could measure the electric field,
so it was possible for him to discover
the mass per magnitude charge
of this particle that he discovered.
As I said,
I don't think that these equations are too important.
What is important to realize is
we can have both an electric and a magnetic field,
and it can be set up such that the net force
on the velocity of this,
the direction of the velocity of this particle
and its velocity actually does not change at all.
And that is where the problems are going to come in,
where we use these two equations,
equal to,
one plus the other,
equal to zero,
to solve a few problems for us.
In the next video, let's have a look at those problems.
