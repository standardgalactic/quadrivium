The text describes two scenarios involving the phase difference between light waves traveling through different paths and materials, affecting their interference patterns.

**Scenario 1:**
- Involves light with a wavelength of 420 nanometers in vacuum traveling at 45-degree angles.
- Setup 1 has path segments totaling 5L (1+2+3+4 meters), while Setup 2 totals L (1+2 meters).
- To achieve destructive interference, the condition \(N_1 - N_2 = \frac{1}{2}\) is used, where \(N\) is the number of wavelengths fitting into path length \(L\).
- Solving gives a minimum \(L\) of approximately 52.5 nanometers, with the next possible L for destructive interference at 158 nanometers.

**Scenario 2:**
- Involves waves traveling through materials with different refractive indices.
- Material 1 has an index of 1.40 over 4.00 micrometers; Material 2 has an index of 1.60 over 3.50 micrometers, with a vacuum wavelength of 600 nanometers.
- The number of wavelengths in each path is \(N_1 = \frac{40}{6}\) and \(N_2 = \frac{35}{6}\).
- The phase difference is \(\frac{5}{6}\) of a wavelength, indicating the waves are closer to constructive interference (\(0.833\) is nearer to 1 than \(\frac{1}{2}\)).

Overall, these scenarios illustrate how differences in path length or refractive index affect phase differences and resulting interference patterns of light waves.
