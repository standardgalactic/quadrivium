The text discusses concepts from both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity concerning momentum.

### Newtonian Mechanics:
- **Momentum Conservation**: In an isolated system (no net external forces), momentum is conserved. For example, the total momentum before a collision equals the total momentum after it.

### Relativistic Momentum:
- **Special Relativity Context**: When dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, relativistic effects must be considered.
- **Relativistic Momentum Formula**: The new definition for momentum in relativity is given by \( p = \frac{mL_0}{\Delta t} \), where \( L_0/\Delta t \) is the velocity. This formula incorporates the Lorentz factor, resulting in:
  \[
  p = \frac{mv}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  \]
  Here, \( m \) is mass, \( v \) is velocity, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Example Calculation:
- **Electron at High Velocity**: An electron with a rest mass of \( 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \) kg accelerated to \( 0.9999999997c \) (where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s) has a relativistic momentum calculated using the above formula, resulting in approximately \( 1.1 \times 10^{-17} \) kgÂ·m/s.
- **Comparison with Non-relativistic Momentum**: The increase in momentum due to relativistic effects is more than 40,000 times greater than at low velocities.

### Conservation of Linear Momentum Example:
- **Ice Skaters Scenario**: A man and a woman on ice skates push apart. Under non-relativistic conditions, if the woman's final velocity is \( 2.5 \) m/s (mass \( 54 \) kg), and the man's mass is \( 88 \) kg, his velocity can be calculated using momentum conservation.
- **Non-relativistic Velocity**: His velocity is found to be approximately \( -1.5 \) m/s.
- **Relativistic Adjustment**: If the speed of light were hypothetically reduced to \( 3 \) m/s, relativistic effects would adjust his velocity to about \( -1.8 \) m/s.

This example illustrates how relativistic momentum differs from classical calculations and highlights the significant impact of high velocities on momentum.
