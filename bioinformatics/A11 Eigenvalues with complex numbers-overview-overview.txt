The text outlines the process of solving a system of linear differential equations characterized by complex eigenvalues. The given system is:

- \( x' = 6x - y \)
- \( y' = 5x + 4y \)

This can be expressed in matrix form as:

\[ \mathbf{x}' = A\mathbf{x} \]

where 

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & -1 \\ 5 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}. \]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve:

\[ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0. \]

The characteristic equation is derived as:

\[ \lambda^2 - 10\lambda + 29 = 0. \]

Using the quadratic formula, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda_1 = 5 + 2i \) and \( \lambda_2 = 5 - 2i \).

For each eigenvalue, we find eigenvectors by solving:

\[ (A - \lambda I)\mathbf{k} = 0. \]

The eigenvector for \( \lambda_1 = 5 + 2i \) is:

\[ \mathbf{k}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1-2i \end{bmatrix}. \]

For \( \lambda_2 = 5 - 2i \), the eigenvector is the complex conjugate of \( \mathbf{k}_1 \):

\[ \mathbf{k}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1+2i \end{bmatrix}. \]

This reflects that for real matrices with complex eigenvalues, their eigenvectors are complex conjugates.

The general solution to the system is expressed as a linear combination of exponential functions:

\[ c_1 e^{(5 + 2i)t} \]
\[ c_2 e^{(5 - 2i)t} \]

where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. The text notes that this solution will be expanded further in a subsequent example.
