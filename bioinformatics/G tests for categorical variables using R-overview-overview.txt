This tutorial introduces two alternatives to the chi-square test for analyzing categorical variables: the g-test. It covers the g-test for goodness of fit, which compares observed frequencies against expected ones using a different statistical formula than the chi-square test. The second alternative is the g-test of independence, which assesses whether two categorical variables are independent by comparing their joint distribution to what would be expected if they were indeed independent, utilizing the g-statistic instead.

The tutorial provides guidance on implementing these tests in R with the `desk tools` library, using examples with fictional data. For goodness of fit, it demonstrates comparing observed counts (175 and 90) against an expected 50-50 distribution. For independence, it uses a contingency table to show how results differ slightly from those obtained with the chi-square test due to the use of the g-statistic.
