Salty hair structures are just in children, especially the younger you get the more prominent.
And for that you need open growth bates.
The management for it is conservative if it's undisplaced.
And close reductions with up KYs if it's displaced.
And reduction should rather be done earlier than later.
So any Salty hair fracture can be seen within 5 days at the fracture clinic with orthopaedic surgeons.
Because after 5 days the fracture starts uniting.
And any reduction would just cause more harm pressing across the fracture line.
And this is the only one that classification actually plays a role in.
Well, not the only one, but the one I think.
The first one is Salty hair is type 1.
Type 1 is a fracture parallel to the growth plate.
And it doesn't involve the shaft or the epithesis.
While a 2 is also a fracture along the growth plate over there.
But it's got a fragment through the shaft.
Your epithesis is still intact and your growth plate is also intact.
Well, as soon as you go to 3, it's a fracture through the epithesis and through the growth plate.
But the shaft is intact.
Now, Salty hairs 1 and 2 has got a good prognosis.
No growth deformities afterwards associated, mostly.
But after 3, 4 and 5, you do overrun the risk of growth deformities forming later.
And then you go down to 4.
4 is a fracture through the shaft as well as through the epithesis and the growth plate.
And 5 is an impacted one.
Now, it's just pictures to demonstrate itself.
Salty hairs 1 of the distal radius.
As you can see, it's going to paddle to the growth plate and displace upwards, which will
need a close reduction.
And this is the 1.
The next one is a 2, which actually grows quite closely deformed.
But as you can see, there's a fragment out of the shaft, though no involvement of the epithesis.
Salty has 3 on the MRI as well as seen.
This also, you can see, is the distal tibia through the epithesis, through the growth plate
and out the side.
And there's one Salty hairs 4, which goes straight through the shaft as well as through
the epithesis at the bottom.
And I couldn't find a big chart of Salty hairs 5.
I went looking for that.
Just the most common dislocation that would probably be seen in casualties is the anti-dislocation
of the shoulder.
The making of injury is usually in sports or in force with an abduction and external rotation
injury.
Clinically, you'll find a fullness in the front of the shoulder, flattened contour of the shoulder
if you have a look at it compared to the other side.
And the arm would most likely be supported with the other hand.
And it would reduce the range of motion as well, especially internal rotation and abduction
would be excruciating painful and the patient would rather refuse that.
And there's always a test for the auxiliary nerve and sensation over the deltoid muscle
as that can be trapped or damaged with the dislocation as well.
This is just a diagnosis on x-rays.
The top one is the normal x-ray and the bottom one is the anti-dislocation.
As you can see, the human on the head is not articulating with the glenoid anymore.
And it's actually sitting in front.
It's why it's supposed to be sitting there.
And the next one is the classic sign that's called the Mercedes-Benz sign.
The one on the left would be the normal sign with the y-formation with the round circle
of the humeral head in the middle.
And the other one would be grossly dislocated, grossly or rather displaced.
Now the management of that would be a reduction in casualty.
You can use different methods.
The Cocker method or the Hippocratic method.
The Hippocratic method is the one on the bottom right where you actually put your foot in the
axilla and while traction, external rotation, you try to lever the head into the glenoid
process with your toes.
Some, not a lot of people like that.
The most popular one would be the Cocker method where you get counter traction with the
sheath through the axilla and you hang on the other arm while you slightly are externally
rotating it and abduction while you try to pop it back in.
The main thing with reducing shoulders is it's a timely process, it's not a quick jerk
or a hard pull to get it back in.
If you can't get it in just to hang on the shoulder, constant tension would actually help
the muscles to relax and then get it in much easier.
If you can't get it in, then muscle relaxers might be needed but shoulders aren't that bad
as it helps.
And then for rehabilitation afterwards, once it's reduced, just an extra to confirm that and
a sling for four weeks and then physiotherapy to help to strengthen the muscles around the shoulder.
And the last little bit is just for temin and nerve injury, especially around the hand.
The examination of the hand so you can locate the injury.
That's actually quite a bad picture.
And it's just to go through the test for your flexor tendons.
Each finger has got two tendons, your flexor digitor superficialis and your profindus.
Profindus flexes just at the distal phalanx while superficialis flexes at the proximal interphalangeal joint.
To test it would be as to hold still all the other fingers.
Ask the patient to flex each finger in turn, like the one at the top, which would show that
the FDS is intact.
And to stabilise the whole finger and just allow them to flex the distal phalanx, which
would show you if FTP is intact.
It's not always possible, especially with a lot of cuts.
People don't want to move their hand because it's just painful.
But you can give them some local just to relieve the pain and then examine it after that.
Flexors of the wrist.
It's the easiest.
You ask the patient to point his fingers upwards like that.
And the most prominent tendon in the middle would be your palmaris longus with flexor
capiradialis and ulnaris on both sides of that, respectively to the side of the ulnar radius.
Extensors of the fingers are easy to test.
Just ask the patient to turn his hand around, put it on the table, and he must lift his fingers
off the bed while under resistance, as well as with the wrist.
Extending it against resistance with the same thing.
And the thumb is the only tricky one.
The distal or interphalangeal flexion of the thumb would be flexor pollicis longus.
Test for that especially, as well as the extension of the thumb.
Extensor pollicis longus.
Test for that individually.
And then you have your nerves supplying the hand.
You have three of them.
Your median ulnar and your radial nerve.
The median nerve is essentially to your thumb and the radial to your fingers.
Your index finger and the half of your middle finger.
And the motor test is just to see if the patient can tense the tenor eminence of the thumb
muscles.
While the ulnar nerve is essentially to the ulnar finger and the half, the little finger,
as well as your ring finger, and the volus surfaces of the ulnar side of the hand as well.
The motor is functioning with the hand is the introscenic muscles of the hand.
They call it the wagging middle finger sign.
The patient can move his middle finger from side to side.
These introscenic muscles are intact.
And these median nerve motor functions are also intact.
And also see if he can tense his hypotenor eminence of the muscles of his little finger.
The radial nerve has no motor function in the hand itself.
It does give you extension of your fingers as well as the wrist.
But the nerve branch that usually get damaged with that is either up in the upper of the
lower arm around the elbow in the upper arm.
It will give you any problems with that.
Because the muscles that actually perform the functions located in the forearm,
it does give you the sensory distribution of the dorsum between your first work space.
It's just to check on that.
