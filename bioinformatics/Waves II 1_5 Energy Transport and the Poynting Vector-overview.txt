The text discusses how electromagnetic wave intensity varies with distance from an isotropic point source. It explains that intensity decreases as the square of the distance (inversely proportional to \( r^2 \)), due to energy spreading over a spherical surface area given by \( 4\pi r^2 \). 

The text presents problems involving calculations related to electromagnetic waves:

1. **Root Mean Square Electric and Magnetic Fields**: For a point source with a power of 250 watts at a distance of 1.8 meters, the root mean square (rms) electric field is calculated as approximately 48.1 volts per meter, using the formula \( E_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{c \mu_0 P}{4 \pi r^2}} \). The rms magnetic field is found by dividing the rms electric field by the speed of light, yielding about \( 1.60 \times 10^{-7} \) tesla.

2. **Magnetic Field Amplitude**: For a wave with an electric field amplitude of \( 3.20 \times 10^{-4} \) volts per meter, the magnetic field amplitude is calculated using \( B_{\text{m}} = \frac{E_{\text{m}}}{c} \), resulting in approximately 1.07 picotesla.

3. **Direction of Magnetic Field**: For a wave traveling along the x-axis with an electric field component in the z-direction, the magnetic field direction is determined using the right-hand rule, resulting in a negative y-direction for \( B \).

4. **Energy in Laser Pulse**: A laser producing 100 terawatts over 1 nanosecond has energy calculated as power times time, giving approximately 0.1 megajoules.

5. **TV Station Power Distribution**: The text mentions a TV station broadcasting isotropically at 1.0 megawatt but does not complete the problem. 

These examples illustrate how to apply formulas and concepts related to electromagnetic wave propagation and intensity calculations.

The text discusses calculating the intensity of electromagnetic waves at a distance from the nearest star and in various other scenarios. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Intensity Calculation for Nearest Star:**
   - The distance to the nearest star is given as 4.3 light-years, which needs conversion to meters using the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s) and converting time from years to seconds.
   - Using the formula \( I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2} \), where \( r \) is in meters, the intensity of electromagnetic waves at this distance is calculated to be approximately \( 4.8 \times 10^{-29} \) watts per square meter, indicating an extremely low value.

2. **Intensity with Maximum Magnetic Field:**
   - For a traveling plane electromagnetic wave where the maximum magnetic field (\( B_M \)) is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \) tesla:
   - The intensity formula used is \( I = \frac{c^2 B_M^2}{2\mu_0 c} \), simplifying to \( I = \frac{B_M^2 c}{2\mu_0} \).

3. **Intensity with Maximum Electric Field:**
   - In a plane radio wave with an electric field maximum of 5 volts per meter:
   - The magnetic field (\( B_M \)) is derived as \( B_M = \frac{E}{c} \).
   - Intensity can be calculated using either the electric or magnetic field, using formulas such as \( I = \frac{E^2}{2\mu_0 c} \) or \( I = \frac{B_M^2 c}{2\mu_0} \).

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding both maximum and root mean square values in these calculations.
