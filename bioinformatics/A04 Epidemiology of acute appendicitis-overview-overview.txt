The text provides an overview of the epidemiology of acute appendicitis. It is a common surgical condition and second only to another unspecified condition in some medical units, affecting up to one in a thousand people. Men have a slightly higher lifetime risk (8.6%) compared to women (6.7%), with prevalence highest among teenagers and young adults, though it can occur at any age. Infants and toddlers are somewhat protected due to anatomical differences that improve drainage of the appendix, while older adults may experience underreporting due to other prevalent conditions.

Geographically, appendicitis is less common in underdeveloped regions, possibly because of dietary factors like higher fiber intake. Fatalities from appendicitis are rare (as low as 2 per million), but mortality rates are higher in underdeveloped areas due to delayed care and limited resources. Older adults also face higher mortality risks due to physiological reserve issues and comorbid conditions.

The main message is that healthcare providers should consider acute appendicitis as a possible cause of abdominal pain in all age groups, regardless of the patient's demographics or context.
