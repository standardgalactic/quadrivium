The text outlines two approaches to finding the time derivative of a function \( f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \):

**Method 1 (Chain Rule):**
- Compute the gradient \( \nabla f \).
- Evaluate it at \( r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \).
- Differentiate \( r(t) \) to get \( \frac{dr}{dt} \).
- Take the dot product of \( \nabla f(r(t)) \) and \( \frac{dr}{dt} \).

**Method 2 (Direct Substitution):**
- Directly compute \( \frac{df}{dt} \) using:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \cdot \frac{dx_i}{dt}
  \]
  where \( x_1 = x(t), x_2 = y(t), x_3 = z(t) \).

**Example:**
- For \( r(t) = (\sin^2 t, \cos^2 t, t) \):
  - Compute \( \nabla f(r(t)) = (\cos^2 t + t, \sin^2 t + t, \cos^2 t + \sin^2 t) \).
  - Compute \( \frac{dr}{dt} = (2\sin t \cos t, -2\sin t \cos t, 1) \).

- Using Method 1:
  \[
  (\sin 2t)(\cos 2t + t) - (\sin 2t)(\sin 2t + t) + 1
  \]
  Evaluated at \( t = \frac{\pi}{2} \), results in 1.

- Method 2 involves substituting directly into:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \cdot \frac{dx_i}{dt}
  \]
  and evaluating at \( t = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Both methods give the same result, confirming their consistency in computing derivatives.
