The text outlines a problem involving Stokes' theorem, which relates a surface integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface to a line integral around the boundary curve. Specifically, it addresses evaluating the line integral \(\oint (y\,dx - 5x\,dy + 3\,dz)\) in three-dimensional space using Stokes' theorem.

The process begins by computing the curl of the vector field \(\mathbf{f} = \langle y, -5x, 3 \rangle\), resulting in \(\langle 0, 0, -6 \rangle\). To apply Stokes' theorem, the orientation of the curve is considered anti-clockwise when viewed from above, implying a positive normal vector.

Next, the plane containing the surface is described by \( Z = 6 - 3X - 2Y \), with a calculated normal vector \(\mathbf{N} = (3, 2, 1)\) and norm \(\sqrt{14}\). The dot product of the curl with this normal vector yields \(-\frac{6}{\sqrt{14}}\).

The surface integral is then transformed into an area integral over the XY-plane. The region for integration is defined by \( Y = -\frac{3}{2}X + 3 \), extending from \( X = 0 \) to \( X = 2 \). For each \( X \), \( Y \) ranges from 0 to \(-\frac{3}{2}X + 3\).

After correcting any calculation errors, the integral evaluates to \(-18\), highlighting the importance of precision in such calculations.
