good let's tackle this rather easy initial value problem we have y prime including this so that
we see this different notation so a variables first derivative plus that variable equals x
and the initial value problem if x equals 0 then y equals 4 what I've done here is just to show
you the we're going to get obviously a family of solutions with a constant in it and depending on
what the constant is we'll get any one of these curves and then that one there is a bit thicker
which is for this initial value problem ends up being the specific solution so it's already in
standard form we don't have to we have a constant coefficient of one in other words there and our
p of x our p of x equals one as well that means our integrating factor there is e to the power
the indefinite integral just of dx and that's e to the power x I can multiply that throughout my
equation there so I'm going to get e to the power xy prime plus e to the power x y equals x e to the
power x I can see that this is now can be written as the first derivative with respect to x of e to
the power x y and as much as as we've seen with all the videos before if I let this equal u and this
is my v prime and I will get this as far as the derivatives concerned and that equals x e to the power x I
transform by taking the derivative by the integral of both sides with respect to x and that leaves me e to the power x y which is going to equal now this side
once again we can use first year single variable calculus I suppose we can then let u equal x and our v prime equals this e to the power x
that will simplify things because u prime will be one and v will still be e to the power x so this is going to equal uv that's x e to the power x minus the integral of u prime v
that's why I chose this to be the x because u prime is now much simpler it's the one and v is e to the power x dx and e to the power x y equals x e to the power x minus e to the power x
x plus some constant we'll call it c1 if I divide throughout by e to the power x is to solve for y that's going to leave me with x minus 1 plus c1 over e to the power x and that is my family of solutions my family of solutions in there will be my homogeneous solution if I let this
y prime plus y prime plus y equals zero now we do have this initial values of x can you see that x equals 0 then y equals 4 so we're going to have the fact that 4 equals 0 minus 1 plus c1 over e to the power 0
in other words c1 equals 5 so my final answer is going to equal y equals x minus 1 plus 5 over e to the power x
and as I said that is the the darker of the curves there that will be my curve of my solution
