The text provides a guide for installing and using IPython Notebook in an Ubuntu 14.04 environment with XFCE desktop. Here's a summary:

1. **Introduction**: IPython is presented as a superior IDE for math-related coding compared to the default IDLE that comes with Python installations.

2. **Installation Steps**:
   - Refer to ipython.org for detailed instructions.
   - Use terminal commands with `sudo` to install necessary libraries: `python-matplotlib`, `python-numpy`, `python-scipy`, `python-sympy`, and `python-pandas`.
   - Install IPython Notebook using `sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook`.

3. **Post-Installation**:
   - Confirm Python is installed or updated, as it typically comes pre-installed on Linux.
   - Learn basic terminal commands like `ls` and `cd` for file management.

4. **Using IPython Notebook**:
   - Launch the notebook via a terminal command to open in a web browser.
   - Navigate folders (e.g., Dropbox) for saving work.
   - Use features such as creating new notebooks, running code cells, embedding HTML, and plotting with matplotlib.

5. **File Management**:
   - Save notebooks using the save function or by renaming them within IPython Notebook.
   - Ensure files are saved on disk by properly closing notebooks.
   - Exit the terminal session of IPython Notebook with `Ctrl+C` twice.

Despite a somewhat complex installation process, IPython offers powerful tools for mathematical and scientific computing.
