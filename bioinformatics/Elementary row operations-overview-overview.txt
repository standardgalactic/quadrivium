The text provides a detailed explanation of solving a system of three linear equations using Gaussian elimination or similar methods. It begins with an initial set of equations:

1. \(2x + y + z = 5\)
2. \(0x + 3y + 15z = 21\)
3. \(0x + 0y + z = 1\)

The process involves solving these equations step-by-step by reducing the system to row-echelon form and using back substitution:

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Solve for \(z\)
From the third equation, it is straightforward:
\[ z = 1 \]

#### Step 2: Substitute \(z\) into the second equation
Substituting \(z = 1\) into the second equation gives:
\[ 3y + 15(1) = 21 \]
\[ 3y + 15 = 21 \]
\[ 3y = 6 \]
\[ y = 2 \]

#### Step 3: Substitute \(z\) and \(y\) into the first equation
With \(z = 1\) and \(y = 2\), substitute these values into the first equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 5 \]
\[ 2x + 3 = 5 \]
\[ 2x = 2 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

### Final Solution
The solutions for the variables are:
- \(x = 1\)
- \(y = 2\)
- \(z = 1\)

This method showcases how Gaussian elimination is used to systematically eliminate variables and solve a system of equations. The text also mentions using Mathematica software to verify this solution by plotting the corresponding planes and performing matrix operations like row reduction. Ultimately, it illustrates the application of linear algebra concepts such as elementary row operations in solving systems of equations and encourages exploring these techniques further.
