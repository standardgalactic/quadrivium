The text provides an overview of seven fundamental limit laws used to simplify the process of calculating limits when they exist. These laws enable straightforward operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising functions to a power.

1. **Addition/Subtraction Law**: The limit of a sum or difference is the sum or difference of their respective limits.
2. **Constant Multiplication Law**: A constant factor can be pulled out of the limit operation.
3. **Product Rule**: The limit of a product is the product of their individual limits.
4. **Quotient Rule**: The limit of a quotient is the quotient of their individual limits, provided the denominator’s limit isn't zero.
5. **Power Rule**: The limit of a function raised to a power is that power applied to the function's limit.
6. **Constant Limit Law**: The limit of a constant is simply the constant itself.
7. **Identity Law**: The limit of t as it approaches c is c.

These laws are illustrated with examples involving polynomial functions and constants, demonstrating how they simplify the calculation process when limits exist. For instance:

- Adding polynomials can be handled by separately finding their limits and then adding them.
- Multiplying a constant outside a function allows the constant to be separated from the limit operation.
- The product of two functions can be evaluated by calculating each function's limit independently before multiplying.
- Dividing one polynomial by another involves taking the limits individually, ensuring the denominator’s limit is non-zero.

The text emphasizes these laws are only applicable when limits exist and uses arithmetic examples to demonstrate their utility in solving problems.

The text provides a walkthrough of evaluating limits using polynomial expressions and limit laws. Here's a summary:

1. **Individual Limits**: When dealing with a fraction where both the numerator and denominator are polynomials, take the limit of each separately, ensuring that the denominator does not equal zero at the point of interest.

2. **Example Calculation**:
   - Given a polynomial \((t^3)\), taking its limit as \(t\) approaches 2 involves evaluating the polynomial first and then applying the power.
   - For instance, if calculating \(\lim_{t \to 2} (t-1)^2\), substitute \(t = 2\): \((2-1)^2 = 1^2 = 1\). Therefore, this term does not cause a zero denominator issue.
   - The result of the limit calculation is shown as 8.

3. **Limit Laws**:
   - Limits can be taken of constants and variables directly, such as \(\lim_{t \to 2} 3 = 3\) or \(\lim_{t \to 2} t = 2\).
   - These examples highlight that limits of constant values remain the same, and limits of a variable as it approaches a specific value are just that value.

4. **General Advice**:
   - The text emphasizes using limit laws for straightforward calculations when the limit exists.
   - It hints at future discussions on conditions where limits do not exist but encourages using these basic techniques in applicable situations.

The passage concludes by encouraging the use of these simple limit laws, while acknowledging that more complex scenarios will be addressed later.
