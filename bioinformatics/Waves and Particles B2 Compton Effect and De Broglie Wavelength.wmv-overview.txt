It looks like you're discussing concepts related to de Broglie wavelengths and diffraction patterns. Let's clarify some points based on your queries:

1. **De Broglie Wavelength**: The de Broglie wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a particle is given by the equation:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{mv}
   \]
   where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(m\) is the mass of the particle, and \(v\) is its velocity. As the velocity increases (or mass decreases), the wavelength decreases.

2. **Wavelength Changes with Velocity**: For a stone falling under gravity, as it accelerates due to gravitational force (\(g\)), its velocity increases, leading to a decrease in its de Broglie wavelength.

3. **Same Wavelength for Different Particles**: An electron and a neutron can have the same de Broglie wavelength if their momenta are equal. Since momentum \(p = mv\), different masses require different velocities to achieve the same momentum (and thus the same wavelength).

4. **Diffraction Angle in Young's Double Slit Experiment**: The angle of diffraction depends on the wavelength and slit width. For a proton compared to an electron, since protons have a larger mass, they have a smaller de Broglie wavelength for the same velocity, leading to a smaller diffraction angle.

5. **Diffraction through a Single Slit**: In single-slit diffraction, particles with a smaller mass (like electrons) will have a larger de Broglie wavelength compared to heavier particles (like protons), resulting in greater diffraction angles.

Your discussion seems to touch on these principles, and if you need further clarification or have specific questions about any part of this topic, feel free to ask!
