The text provides an overview of solving equations within group theory, highlighting its differences from standard algebra. In groups, operations must satisfy closure, associativity, identity, and inverses but do not necessarily require commutativity. Solving for elements like \( x \) involves applying these properties rather than typical algebraic manipulation.

Examples demonstrate how to solve equations such as \( x^2a = b \) and simultaneous equations like \( x^2a = bc^{-1} \) and \( xc^{-1}a = xa c \), using group-specific rules. These exercises illustrate that elements follow the group's structure, not simple numerical operations.

The text emphasizes practicing these problems to understand non-algebraic problem-solving in groups and appreciate their unique characteristics.
