The text discusses derivatives with an emphasis on understanding the concept of the slope of a line, represented by \( y = mx + c \). Here, \( m \) is the slope, calculated as the change in \( y \) divided by the change in \( x \), indicating how much \( y \) changes per unit increase in \( x \). As the slope increases, lines become steeper, approaching a vertical position where the slope becomes infinite. Conversely, horizontal lines have a zero slope.

Understanding and calculating slopes is crucial for applications such as analyzing experimental data. An example provided involves plotting concentration versus growth velocity; by fitting a straight line to data points, one can predict outcomes at untested concentrations using the slope's predictive power. This illustrates the practical significance of knowing how to calculate and interpret slopes in real-world scenarios.
