The text describes the process of evaluating a line integral along a line segment in three-dimensional space, from point \( (1, 0, 1) \) to point \( (3, 1, 2) \), for the function \( f(x, y, z) = xy + z \).

1. **Line Segment Representation**: 
   - The line segment is represented parametrically as a vector equation: \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (1, 0, 1) + t(2, 1, 1) \), where \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1.
   - This results in the parametric equations: 
     - \( x(t) = 1 + 2t \)
     - \( y(t) = t \)
     - \( z(t) = 1 + t \)

2. **Function Substitution**:
   - Substitute these into the function \( f(x, y, z) = xy + z \):
     - \( f(\mathbf{r}(t)) = (1 + 2t)t + (1 + t) = 2t^2 + 2t + 1 \)

3. **Line Integral Setup**:
   - The line integral is expressed as: 
     \[
     \int_{0}^{1} f(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \, dt
     \]
   - Compute \( \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = (2, 1, 1) \), so \( x'(t) = 2 \).

4. **Integral Evaluation**:
   - The integral becomes:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{1} (2t^2 + 2t + 1) \cdot 2 \, dt
     \]
   - Simplify and evaluate:
     \[
     = 2 \int_{0}^{1} (2t^2 + 2t + 1) \, dt
     \]
     \[
     = 2 \left[ \frac{2}{3}t^3 + t^2 + t \right]_{0}^{1}
     \]
     \[
     = 2 \left( \frac{2}{3} + 1 + 1 \right)
     \]
     \[
     = 2 \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}
     \]

Thus, the value of the line integral is \( \frac{16}{3} \).

The text outlines the process of evaluating a line integral along a line segment in three-dimensional space. Here's a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: We need to evaluate a line integral for a function \( f(x, y, z) = xy + z \) along a line segment from point \( (1, 0, 1) \) to point \( (3, 1, 2) \).

2. **Parameterization of the Line Segment**: 
   - The direction vector from the initial to the final point is calculated as \( (2, 1, 1) \).
   - A parameterized form of the line segment is given by:
     \[
     \mathbf{r}(t) = (1 + 2t, t, 1 + t)
     \]
   - Here, \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1.

3. **Substitution into the Function**:
   - Substitute \( x = 1 + 2t \), \( y = t \), and \( z = 1 + t \) into the function \( f(x, y, z) = xy + z \).
   - This results in a new function of \( t \): 
     \[
     f(t) = (1 + 2t)t + (1 + t) = 2t^2 + 2t + 1
     \]

4. **Derivative Calculation**:
   - Compute the derivative \( x'(t) \), which is the derivative of \( x = 1 + 2t \) with respect to \( t \). This gives \( x'(t) = 2 \).

5. **Line Integral Setup**:
   - The line integral is expressed as:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{1} f(t) \cdot x'(t) \, dt
     \]
   - Substitute the expressions for \( f(t) \) and \( x'(t) \):
     \[
     \int_{0}^{1} (2t^2 + 2t + 1) \cdot 2 \, dt = 2 \int_{0}^{1} (2t^2 + 2t + 1) \, dt
     \]

6. **Integration**:
   - Evaluate the integral:
     \[
     2 \left[ \frac{2}{3}t^3 + t^2 + t \right]_{0}^{1}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2 \left( \frac{2}{3} + 1 + 1 \right) = 2 \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}
     \]

7. **Conclusion**: The value of the line integral is \( \frac{16}{3} \).
