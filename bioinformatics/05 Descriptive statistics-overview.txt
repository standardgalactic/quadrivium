The text provides an overview of conducting basic descriptive statistics using SPSS software. It begins by explaining how to obtain simple statistical measures like mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range for numerical variables such as age, temperature, heart rate, white salt count, and months. These calculations can be done individually or collectively for all relevant variables.

For categorical data analysis, it describes using cross-tabulation (Cross Tabs) in SPSS to create a matrix that displays counts of outcomes based on categoriesâ€”in this case, diabetes status versus patient outcome (survived/died). This method provides an overview by showing how many patients with and without diabetes survived or died.

The text also hints at the next steps beyond simple descriptive statistics, suggesting further analysis such as splitting data into subgroups (e.g., survivors vs. non-survivors) to compare specific metrics like age differences between these groups.
