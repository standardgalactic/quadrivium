"Physics 1" is a course designed to teach students how to think like real physicists, emphasizing the innovative application of equations in fields such as quantum mechanics and high-energy physics. Unlike traditional courses that focus on memorizing equations, this course stresses understanding their development process and encouraging deeper comprehension through the integration of mathematics and physics.

Accessible to all interested learners, whether following a structured curriculum or exploring independently, the course encourages self-directed learning, exemplified by Elon Musk's success story. Starting with lecture one, it covers fundamental concepts like laws of nature, Newtonâ€™s laws of motion, conserved quantities, and symmetry principles, prioritizing understanding over rote memorization.

The text concludes with motivational encouragement for students to pursue personal goals and seek knowledge beyond conventional educational limits.
