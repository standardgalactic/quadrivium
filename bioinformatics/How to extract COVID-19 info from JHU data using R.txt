In this very short video on using R for data analysis we can use the Johns Hopkins data set
of the coronavirus data and I'm just going to show you how to extract information from it
and how to do some simple visualizations. We're going to use Plotly for that and just draw some
conclusions. Now I'm going to warn you it's based on South African data and I'm just going to use
South Africa as an example. I'm also going to compare it to the United Kingdom and to Germany
just to draw some conclusions for a country like South Africa which is a month or two behind as far
as the case numbers are concerned and how that might translate into what's going to happen over
the next two months. Now nothing ages like a YouTube video and I'm going to say that again
during the screencast and you know two months from now we'll know exactly what had happened.
So this is not the aim of that it's just a video of how to extract some data and now there's lots
of ways to extract data from the Johns Hopkins data set and I'm going to show you just one. We're just
going to extract some countries and we're going to build a new long form data frame and we're going
to transform our data into there and do some simple analysis descriptive statistics at least
and some data visualization. So the data that we're going to use is from Johns Hopkins University
and they keep a repository. The repository is also available on GitHub and it gets updated daily.
Now we've got to be circumspect about this data. Of course it's not very accurate. I think it's the
the best job that has been done all over the world to collate this data but if we just think locally
of course I think in most places there'll be a lot of people that do not come for testing when they
are ill and they of course never registered in the data. There are some seroprevalence studies. There
are seroprevalence studies right in South Africa and some of them are suggesting a much higher positive
rate than than the rate of actual positive cases from from swabs. In some instances seroprevalence
rate after the first wave of of up to a quarter might be even more and of course while we now today
very much an upward climb as far as the second wave is concerned of course the seroprevalence rate
is just going to climb. But this is the best data that we have and what we're trying to achieve here is
not look at the absolute values for any one specific country we're looking at trends and we're looking
at comparisons. So you can see the aims here of this notebook is just to show you how to use the R
language to deal with the data that you can get from Johns Hopkins at least on the GitHub repository.
So this is going to be as an introduction we're not going to get into it deeply but there's some vagaries
to that data set and you you have to know how to how to wrangle the data to get the the answers that
you're looking for. So that's one thing just to show you how to use the R language for that the second
aim is just going to use it as a as a teaching resource for data analysis because we are going
to get do some data analysis in this notebook and we're going to we're going to use that as as teaching
material how to do how to do and think about data analysis and I hinted to that of course and saying
we're not looking at the absolute absolute values we want to see some interesting plots and we want
to draw some conclusions from that and that's data science. I'm going to also compare countries so
this is inherently meant for South Africa and I'm also going to add Germany and the United Kingdom to
this as my two countries of comparison just because those would be two first world countries that I
want to compare South Africa to which is most definitely not and those countries bar a couple of
million cases people is roughly sort of in the same ballpark figure when it comes to the size of the
population and of course we want to express our data per per hundred thousand people or some such
some such ratio so that we can compare different countries to each other but if you
want to see the comparison with other countries if you use R certainly you can you can use this notebook
and just extract some of that data and what I what I want to talk about and just hop back to is the
fact that this is data for South Africa and what what lies ahead for us now nothing ages as quickly as
a YouTube video and if I have the time and the ability suddenly I'll make a follow-up to this because
by the time you watch this we know you know you would have known what was going to happen so we said
right here at the end you saw the date there we said right here at the end of December and you know
thinking forward what's going to happen and instead of using in this notebook at least
recurrent neural networks as far as deep learning is concerned or other some
way to predict the future some differential equations etc to to predict the future
we we're just going to use what has happened to other countries that are ahead of us in the timeline to
predict what's going to happen to us or look forward at least what's going to happen to us the libraries
that we're going to use to import into our and remember with these libraries we extend the
functions that are available to the language we use the reader the library the plotly library and the
dt library so readers can allow me to import a spreadsheet file that contains the data that's from
Johns Hopkins and it's going to store it as a table which is easy to manipulate plotly is going to be my
library for data visualization because it's nice and interactive and dt is just to create nice tables on
on an html which is for display in a browser and this document that you should see now comes from the
markdown file which i admitted into an html file and that's the result that you see here so the data
you can see this is the url for Johns Hopkins github repository as far as where the data is concerned and
you can see here the data is in a csv format comma separated values if you don't know what that is remember
that is just a very generic way of displaying spreadsheet data so it isn't a spreadsheet
but it is in what we call wide format and we'll see you know there are problems with dealing with
wide format data so i've imported the day using the reader from the reader library that we imported the
read underscore csv function and then pass the url as a string string because it's inside of
quotation marks and i'm passing that to a computer variable that i've called confirmed raw so that's
just the raw data as it comes in remember the computer variable names that you use that's up to
you just make them descriptive so you know you know when you see that again weeks down the line that you
know what you were what you were trying to do the names function is just going to give me the column
headers the names of the first row in the first row of the data so the the heads of the of each of the
columns we all know what a spreadsheet looks like down the columns down that column is going to be
this sort of the same data and what you we can see here the first column states uh province or state
and the second one country or region latitude longitude and then every day from the 22nd of january
becomes its own column and that's why this is wide data instead of long data and long data
we would rather have a column for dates and down the rows go all the dates but here the dates are along
the columns and so that's wide data and we'll have to do something about that so you can see
in this data set every day it's going to be different but it goes until yesterday which was the 27th
so every time you run this you're going to get a new date if you if you do this your your final value
and it's going to be different and you're going to have more columns in your data set and we'll have
to address that fact and the way that i'm going to do that is the end col function there it's going
to tell us how many columns there on the data in the data set as i said every day you do this there's
going to be a different number and i'm and i'm assigning this to a computer variable that i'm
calling last dot day dot number so that i know sort of what the column value is of the last
column in my data set and then i'm going to extract from that the actual date and you can see there
this is 12 27 20 so this month day year in that format which is not the format that we wanted in
for analysis so what i'm going to do i'm going to extract that very last date in the top row in
other words my column headers as an assigner to last dot date the computer variable last dot date
i'm using the as date function so i'm taking names from confirm draw and i'm using index notation here
so in that first row which is my column headers the final column in col confirm draw so i could have
just said there last dot day dot number because i've assigned that to last dot day dot number but i want
to extract that as an as a date so i'm passing all of that as arguments to as date and i'm telling
telling r here that at the moment it's in month day year and it's lowercase y because it's not 2020
it just states the 20 there so it's not an uppercase y so say that that is a string and please extract
that as a date in the format in which that string is is this little format here and once we've done that
we have our last date as a date as a date so let's extract data just from south africa
and i'm going to assign that to computable uh computable sa and we know the country
forward slash region that is where all the country names are listed and so i'm going to say use index
notation again so take the confirm draw data frame and confirm draw dollar country
forward slash region and because that forward slash is not a standard character i put these
in these little tick marks so i've got to put that in tick marks i can't just use the name after the
dollar symbol there equals equals so this is some boolean logic here if it is south africa please
include that in this new variable essays i'm just extracting all that row that contains the data for
south africa and remember comma all the columns so that row specific row that has south africa in it
all the columns because this is wide data now what i want to do is remember the first one was state and
the second one is country region and then longitude and then latitude so it's only from column 5 onwards
which was 22 january onwards that we have the actual confirm cases the the numbers so i'm going to assign
that to a variable that i'm going to call sa dot cases and what i'm going to do is i'm going to use
the as dot numeric function to extract that as a vector so i'm just going to have the list of cases day
by day i'm extracting that so i'm saying take what you have to take is from the sa data frame that i have now
take row one there's just this one row of data five from five colon last day number so that's from
five right till the end and that's why i saved it as last dot day dot number remember that was
how many columns i have 200 or 400 or whatever 200 and something whatever the case might be
so from column five right till the end so now i'm going to have a vector just of the case values
similarly i want another list another vector that just contains dates so i'm going to say call it
dates i'm going to assign to that a sequence seq function as date start on the first day
end on the last day and remember i saved that as a computer variable last dot date
and do that day by day so i'm going to have 22 january 23 january 24 january right up till 27 december
and now with these two vectors i'm going to create a new data frame which is now going to be in long
form so my first column is going to be the dates and my second column is going to be the actual values
and i'm going to assign that data frame to the computable df and then i'm going to use the data
table function and print df to the screen and that's why you can now see we have this in long form
so on the 22nd of january we had no cases 23rd of january no cases and this table you can just flick
through this table and we can flick through this table flick through it and there we start seeing
our first case there on the 5th of march but it's now in long form so i only have two columns the day
column to give me the date and an rsa cases column to do that and when i created this data frame right
there that's how i got the column headers so i'm saying make a column header called day and pass
the dates that vector of dates that we created up here that sequence of dates and create another
column called rsa cases and pass to that this list of case numbers that we extracted there using indexing
and the as numeric function so now i have a data set that i can really work with and that's the crux of
the matter of how to extract that long data into the that y data into this long format data and this is
just one way to do it that's the beauty of the r language there are better ways to do this easier
ways to do this longer more complex ways to do this there are many ways to do this this is one way
which is particularly i think easy to understand so i think youtube is going to put a little ad right
now so if you wanted to take a break now is the time and i'll see you after the break so let's
visualize this data from south africa we've got it in long long format now and i'm going to use plotly so
plot underscore ly is the function on my x-axis i want from my data frame the day and on my y
i want the rsa cases the mode that i want is markers so just little dots the type that i want is a
scatter plot and the name i'm going to give it is rsa and i'm using the pipe operator there to pipe that
to all of this to the layout function and then the layout function i want title x-axis and y-axis
that's my title that i pass as a string my x-axis you can do a lot of stuff to that so you've got to
pass those parameters or arguments as a list so i just want to change the title there so i'm giving
it a title date and number of cases and then when we draw this to the screen we can see we can see
how the cases started here nothing on 22nd of january and i like this interactive plot because every place
i hover we can see what happens so there was our first wave sort of come down for a little bit
and we wait into the second wave and the last dot there was going to be of the 27th of december where
we had reached a million registered cases at least and of course this is all interactive so i can just
draw a little square over there and it's going to zoom in and i can also just move it around
um just to have a look at different bits so i can just really zoom in and of course i can go
go back and hit the home button reset the axis and we're back to that so it's very nice sort of just
to to zone in there on the data that you are looking for and you can of course just export this there
as a png file in case you want this in a report
so that's it but what we what we want is so this is the cumulative cases what is the case number per
day so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my data frame and i'm going to add rsa daily a new
column that i'm going to call rsa daily and i'm just going to take every day's case
the cumulative case and i'm going to subtract that from this using the lag function so my lag is going
to be set for one day so it's just going to look for cumulative the cumulative values the difference
between each day so that difference will of course be the number of new cases the next day so that's
very easy to use with the dp dp lyr dplyr package it has a lag function and that's very easy to do so
now we're going to plot every day's new cases and we can now clearly see the the the two waves
and already the the second wave is out sprinting you know the peak of the first wave which is about
thirteen thousand nine hundred cases and here we have fourteen thousand seven hundred new cases
registered on each day so you can clearly see what's happening there so that's quite interesting
enough but let's take a country a country sort of similar population and we have a look at what
happened you know to them because we know we're trailing them by by a couple of months so let's add
germany in the united kingdom so we're going to go through the exact same steps i'm going to
say confirm draw the country is that germany and let's be included i'm going to extract the values
again as a numeric vector and i'm going to create a new column to my data data data set my data frame
i'm going to call it germany cases and germany daily and the daily remember i'm just going to use the lag
function again so we get that exact same information made for south africa we're going to get for united
for germany as well and there we can see clearly this lag i mean the first wave started for germany
round right about here in march and we started this climb only here in may so lagging a couple of months
behind there and we can clearly see the second wave way out sprinting the first wave as far as germany is
concerned and we can see that you know with a couple of months we are behind now you've got to wonder
where are we going to go and the concerning thing here of course is if you look when the sort of steady
state was reached when in this plateau here the south african plateau even with a smaller population
was much higher so where are we going to be in two months time that's the big concern and before i
say something about that i think this this this plot at least for us for everyone is quite concerning
of course for germany but for south africa as well and what we do now is just to plot the
different numbers and as you can see um quite a quite a scattering there and the the reasons for
that for for representing the data here in germany and then in south africa again clearly a couple of
months later and you can you can see also when we went through this phase after the first wave that
there were quite a few number of cases per day as opposed to germany that went down quite far 422
and we stayed much higher still in the 2000s so that's that's we that's very concerning so there's
about a 20 million people difference in the population so i said sort of in the same ballpark
but it's not really the other problem that we have with this data not only is it not accurate because
not all cases come for testing especially we know here in south africa seeing that the prevalence rate
is so much higher than the actual the confirmed rate is that we also don't have accurate numbers as far
as the population is concerned we do know that we have a lot of illegal immigration in south africa
whether a subset of those people had gone back to their countries to to our northern borders
we're not 100 sure this is also population data from 2018 so it's not accurate but as i say the idea
here is to compare and to look at changes over time so for that we don't have to be terribly accurate with
our numbers so what i'm going to do is sa population you can see there in german population and we're just
dividing that by 100 000 so that we can express the number of cases per 100 000 people and that's going
to give us more of a sort of equal pegging and then i'm just adding new columns here with the same sort of
scenario so i'm just taking the total cumulative cases and the daily cases and just dividing that by
this per 100 000 people a value that i have and now you can see you know we're still in as far south
africa at least is concerned is still in trouble and as much as when we had this period after the second
wave much much higher even even normalizing for the size of the populations and of course we can see
sort of catching up in as much as our the time lag between the first wave and the second wave was a
was a lot shorter and we can see a similar thing here for so for the daily cases so let's as i
mentioned before let's add united kingdom to this which has even higher rate than germany and again
you can scrutinize this data remember it's always easy just to zoom in on this data and now we zoomed
quite you know zoomed in we can also pan around so i can pan around left and right or we can just go
back reset the axis and we're back to a chart so it's nice and interactive and again i think as
pertaining to those two countries you know what lies in store for us and once again just here when it
comes to the daily cases and you can see for the united kingdom first wave second wave and a kind of a
dip and almost a third wave now and we can think exactly the same thing is going to happen now just
yesterday as far as the as far as the timing of this recording is concerned we have had the fact
that we are back to level three restrictions we had level five which is total lockdown four three to one
and as far as level three is concerned well these things are not that precise because
what level three was before and what level three was now is a bit different but at least yesterday there
were some changes again some new restrictions brought in to try and and get this under control
now how much of this is due to a virus that is more contagious and we all see that in the reports and
we know in vivo tests suggest that there is better binding to receptors but that's in vivo that you know
that does not always translate to what happens in the real world and i don't think there there are particular
studies that really have confirmed the fact that this is more contagious because certainly we've had
gross changes in the way people interact we've all noticed that people have gone on holiday they gather
they don't adhere to to social distancing they don't wear masks properly we've seen that change
in the attitude and surely the changes that we see here cannot all be put into mutations of the virus we
know there's over 100 000 i think mutations now identified in this in the virus so where is this
all going to end certainly if the changes that were brought in yesterday from this date at least it seems
like we're not in for a rosy january and february as we would hope of course the economy suffers from all
of this the healthcare system suffers from this and we all fear time when people will come to the hospital and
this is no way to be helped i think the reality might strike for for people then behavior certainly
has to be kept in check the on the other hand the economies have to be kept running in south africa of
course the there's going to be a gross delay in vaccination we struggle to pay just the deposit to
be part of the covax covax covax is never going to produce or provide us i think with enough
vials of vaccination then to cover the whole population it's only going to be a subset of
the population and by the time it becomes widely available in south africa one has to wonder what the
seroprevalence rate is going to be you know how close are we going to get to herd immunity before
probably by the end of 2021 where we see max mass vaccinations in south africa and of course this
is a novel virus we don't know where it goes i think the prevailing thought is that it would not
that the mutations would not lead to a requirement in the change of the vaccine but it is a novel
virus so we can't speak with any kind of surety as far as that is concerned but i think from this data
at least unless something major happens that the next two months might not be might not the cases
caseload might not be or change in the way that we would hope that that's going to rise and it's going
to rise considerably considerably as people now have been on vacation met with their friends and family
and are going to do new year celebrations and we'll have to see what january and february at least
has has has in store for us i hope you found this video informative if so remember please subscribe
