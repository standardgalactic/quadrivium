The text provides an overview of electric current and resistance, focusing on the flow of electrons in conductors. Key points include:

1. **Definition of Current**: Electric current is defined as the flow of electrons driven by an electric field. Electrons move opposite to the direction of the electric field.

2. **Conditions for Current Flow**: Not all electron movement constitutes a current. For instance, in a neutral metal wire without an external electric field, electrons move randomly with no net flow or current.

3. **Current Direction Convention**: Although electrons are negatively charged and move from negative to positive terminals, by convention, current is described as flowing from the positive to the negative terminal due to historical reasons tied to proton flow analogies.

4. **Current as a Scalar Quantity**: Current is not vectorial despite having direction; it's a scalar quantity defined as \( I = \frac{dq}{dt} \), where charge (q) and time (t) are scalars.

5. **Charge Conservation**: Charge conservation dictates that if current splits at any point, the total current before splitting equals the sum of currents after splitting.

6. **Drift Velocity**: In conductors carrying a steady current, electrons have a slow drift velocity superimposed on their random thermal motion, which is responsible for the net flow of charge constituting the electric current.

7. **Charge Density and Current Density**: The text introduces the concept of current density (J), defined as \( J = \frac{I}{A} \) where I is current and A is cross-sectional area. Charge density \( n \times e \) relates to the number of charge carriers per unit volume and their charge.

8. **Problem Example**: The text concludes with a problem involving calculating the current through an outer portion of a cylindrical wire using given current density and dimensions, emphasizing practical application in understanding these concepts.

This summary encapsulates both theoretical concepts and practical insights into how electric currents behave under various conditions.

The text outlines how to calculate current using calculus when given the current density \( j \) and its relationship with charge per unit area. Here's a summary of the approach described:

1. **Basic Setup**: 
   - Current density (\( j \)) is defined as charge divided by area.
   - To find the total current (\( I \)), you multiply the current density by the cross-sectional area through which it flows.

2. **Constant Current Density**:
   - When \( j \) is constant, the differential current \( dI \) can be expressed as: 
     \[
     dI = j \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
     \]
     where \( 2\pi r \, dr \) represents the differential area of a cylindrical surface.
   - Integrate from the inner radius (0.001 m) to the outer radius (0.002 m):
     \[
     I = \int_{0.001}^{0.002} j \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
     \]
   - Solving this integral gives:
     \[
     I = \pi j \left( r^2 \right) \bigg|_{0.001}^{0.002}
     \]
   - Substituting \( j = 2.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{A/m}^2 \), the result is approximately 1.9 A.

3. **Variable Current Density**:
   - If \( j \) varies with radius as \( j = 3.0 \times 10^{11} r^2 \):
     \[
     dI = 3.0 \times 10^{11} r^2 \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
     \]
   - Integrate from the inner to outer radius:
     \[
     I = \int_{0.001}^{0.002} 6.0 \times 10^{11} \pi r^3 \, dr
     \]
   - Solving this gives:
     \[
     I = \frac{6.0 \times 10^{11} \pi}{4} \left( r^4 \right) \bigg|_{0.001}^{0.002}
     \]

This approach shows how to handle both constant and variable current densities using integration over a specified radial range.

The text discusses electric current and resistance, focusing on the concept of current as the flow of electrons due to an electric field. Key points include:

1. **Nature of Current**: 
   - Current is defined as the net flow of electrons in a conductor caused by an electric field.
   - Electrons move from negative to positive terminals, opposite to the direction of the electric field.

2. **Current vs. Electron Movement**:
   - Not all electron movement constitutes current; there must be a net flow in one direction for current to exist.
   - In a neutral wire with no electric field, electrons move randomly without creating a net current.

3. **Current as a Scalar Quantity**:
   - Current is represented by \( I = \frac{dq}{dt} \), indicating the charge per unit time through a section.
   - It flows in a direction but is not a vector; it does not follow vector addition rules.

4. **Conservation of Charge**:
   - In circuits, if current splits into different branches (e.g., \( I_0 = I_1 + I_2 \)), charge conservation holds regardless of the circuit configuration.

5. **Drift Velocity and Charge Density**:
   - Drift velocity (\( v_d \)) is much slower than random electron movement but gives rise to current.
   - Current density (\( J \)) relates to drift velocity, number of charged particles per unit volume (\( n \)), and charge of each particle (\( e \)).
   - The relationship \( J = n \cdot e \cdot v_d \) links current density with these quantities.

6. **Example Problem**:
   - A cylindrical wire has a radius of 0.0020 meters.
   - Current density is given as \( 2.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{A/m}^2 \).
   - The problem asks to find the current through an outer portion from half the radius to the full radius.

This explanation provides a comprehensive understanding of how electric current and related concepts are described in the text.

The text describes the process of calculating current through a cylindrical surface using calculus, given an equation for current density. Initially, the current density \( j \) is constant and equals charge per unit area. The task is to find the total current \( I \), which involves integrating over the differential area \( dA \).

### Part 1: Constant Current Density

1. **Current Density Equation**: 
   - \( j = \frac{\text{charge}}{\text{area}} \)
   - \( I = j \times A \)

2. **Differential Area**:
   - For a cylinder, the differential area \( dA = 2\pi r \, dr \).

3. **Integration for Current**:
   - \( dI = j \cdot 2\pi r \, dr \)
   - Integrate from \( r = 0.001 \) to \( r = 0.002 \):
     \[
     I = \int_{0.001}^{0.002} j \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
     \]
   - Result: 
     \[
     I = \pi j (r^2) \bigg|_{0.001}^{0.002}
     \]
   - With \( j = 2.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{A/m}^2 \), calculate to find \( I \approx 1.9 \, \text{A} \).

### Part 2: Variable Current Density

1. **Variable Current Density**:
   - Given \( j = 3.0 \times 10^{11} \cdot r^2 \, \text{A/m}^4 \).

2. **Integration for Current**:
   - \( dI = (3.0 \times 10^{11} \cdot r^2) \cdot 2\pi r \, dr \)
   - Integrate from \( r = 0.001 \) to \( r = 0.002 \):
     \[
     I = \int_{0.001}^{0.002} 6\pi \times 10^{11} \cdot r^3 \, dr
     \]
   - Result:
     \[
     I = \frac{6\pi \times 10^{11}}{4} (r^4) \bigg|_{0.001}^{0.002}
     \]

The text emphasizes using calculus to integrate over the radius for both constant and variable current densities, demonstrating how changes in \( j \) affect the integration process.
