The text provides an overview of electric current and resistance, focusing on the flow of electrons in conductors. Key points include:

1. **Definition of Current**: Electric current is defined as the flow of electrons driven by an electric field. Electrons move opposite to the direction of the electric field.

2. **Conditions for Current Flow**: Not all electron movement constitutes a current. For instance, in a neutral metal wire without an external electric field, electrons move randomly with no net flow or current.

3. **Current Direction Convention**: Although electrons are negatively charged and move from negative to positive terminals, by convention, current is described as flowing from the positive to the negative terminal due to historical reasons tied to proton flow analogies.

4. **Current as a Scalar Quantity**: Current is not vectorial despite having direction; it's a scalar quantity defined as \( I = \frac{dq}{dt} \), where charge (q) and time (t) are scalars.

5. **Charge Conservation**: Charge conservation dictates that if current splits at any point, the total current before splitting equals the sum of currents after splitting.

6. **Drift Velocity**: In conductors carrying a steady current, electrons have a slow drift velocity superimposed on their random thermal motion, which is responsible for the net flow of charge constituting the electric current.

7. **Charge Density and Current Density**: The text introduces the concept of current density (J), defined as \( J = \frac{I}{A} \) where I is current and A is cross-sectional area. Charge density \( n \times e \) relates to the number of charge carriers per unit volume and their charge.

8. **Problem Example**: The text concludes with a problem involving calculating the current through an outer portion of a cylindrical wire using given current density and dimensions, emphasizing practical application in understanding these concepts.

This summary encapsulates both theoretical concepts and practical insights into how electric currents behave under various conditions.

The text outlines how to calculate current using calculus when given the current density \( j \) and its relationship with charge per unit area. Here's a summary of the approach described:

1. **Basic Setup**: 
   - Current density (\( j \)) is defined as charge divided by area.
   - To find the total current (\( I \)), you multiply the current density by the cross-sectional area through which it flows.

2. **Constant Current Density**:
   - When \( j \) is constant, the differential current \( dI \) can be expressed as: 
     \[
     dI = j \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
     \]
     where \( 2\pi r \, dr \) represents the differential area of a cylindrical surface.
   - Integrate from the inner radius (0.001 m) to the outer radius (0.002 m):
     \[
     I = \int_{0.001}^{0.002} j \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
     \]
   - Solving this integral gives:
     \[
     I = \pi j \left( r^2 \right) \bigg|_{0.001}^{0.002}
     \]
   - Substituting \( j = 2.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{A/m}^2 \), the result is approximately 1.9 A.

3. **Variable Current Density**:
   - If \( j \) varies with radius as \( j = 3.0 \times 10^{11} r^2 \):
     \[
     dI = 3.0 \times 10^{11} r^2 \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
     \]
   - Integrate from the inner to outer radius:
     \[
     I = \int_{0.001}^{0.002} 6.0 \times 10^{11} \pi r^3 \, dr
     \]
   - Solving this gives:
     \[
     I = \frac{6.0 \times 10^{11} \pi}{4} \left( r^4 \right) \bigg|_{0.001}^{0.002}
     \]

This approach shows how to handle both constant and variable current densities using integration over a specified radial range.
