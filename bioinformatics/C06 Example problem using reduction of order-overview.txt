The text describes solving a second-order linear ordinary differential equation given by \( y' - 4y' + 4y = 0 \). A known solution is \( y_1 = e^{2x} \), which is independent. To find the general solution, the substitution method of reducing the order is employed.

Here's a summary of the steps:

1. **Substitution**: Assume \( y = u \cdot y_1 = u \cdot e^{2x} \). Then, express derivatives in terms of \( u \):
   - \( y' = u'e^{2x} + 2ue^{2x} \)
   - \( y'' = u''e^{2x} + 4u'e^{2x} + 4ue^{2x} \)

2. **Substitute into the Original Equation**: Replace \( y, y', y'' \) in the differential equation:
   - The equation simplifies to: 
     \[
     (u''e^{2x} + 4u'e^{2x} + 4ue^{2x}) - 4(u'e^{2x} + 2ue^{2x}) + 4ue^{2x} = 0
     \]
   - Simplifying further, this reduces to:
     \[
     u''e^{2x} = 0
     \]

3. **Solve for \( u \)**: Since \( e^{2x} \neq 0 \), it follows that \( u'' = 0 \).

4. **Integrate**: Integrate twice to find \( u \):
   - First integration gives \( u' = c_1 \)
   - Second integration gives \( u = c_1 x + c_2 \)

5. **Back-Substitute for \( y \)**: Since \( y = u \cdot e^{2x} \), substitute back:
   - \( y = (c_1 x + c_2) e^{2x} \)
   - This simplifies to the general solution:
     \[
     y = c_1 x e^{2x} + c_2 e^{2x}
     \]

The solutions \( x e^{2x} \) and \( e^{2x} \) are linearly independent, forming a complete set of solutions for the differential equation.

The text outlines a method for solving a second-order linear ordinary differential equation: \( y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0 \). The solution involves using a known particular solution, \( y_1 = e^{2x} \), and reducing the order of the differential equation. 

Here's a step-by-step summary:

1. **Substitution**: Assume \( y = u \cdot y_1 = u \cdot e^{2x} \). This substitution transforms the original problem into finding \( u(x) \).

2. **Derivatives**:
   - First derivative: \( y' = u'e^{2x} + 2ue^{2x} \)
   - Second derivative: \( y'' = u''e^{2x} + 4u'e^{2x} + 4ue^{2x} \)

3. **Substitute into the original equation**:
   - Substitute \( y, y', \) and \( y'' \) back into \( y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0 \).
   - This simplifies to: \( u''e^{2x} = 0 \).

4. **Solve for \( u \)**:
   - Since \( e^{2x} \neq 0 \), it follows that \( u'' = 0 \).
   - Integrate twice to find \( u(x) = c_1 x + c_2 \).

5. **Back-substitute**:
   - Recall \( y = u \cdot e^{2x} \).
   - Thus, \( y = (c_1 x + c_2)e^{2x} = c_1 x e^{2x} + c_2 e^{2x} \).

6. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution is \( y = c_1 x e^{2x} + c_2 e^{2x} \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants.
   - This represents a linearly independent set of solutions: \( x e^{2x} \) and \( e^{2x} \).

The solution method effectively reduces the order of the differential equation by leveraging a known particular solution.
