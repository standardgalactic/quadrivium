The text describes solving a second-order linear ordinary differential equation given by \( y' - 4y' + 4y = 0 \). A known solution is \( y_1 = e^{2x} \), which is independent. To find the general solution, the substitution method of reducing the order is employed.

Here's a summary of the steps:

1. **Substitution**: Assume \( y = u \cdot y_1 = u \cdot e^{2x} \). Then, express derivatives in terms of \( u \):
   - \( y' = u'e^{2x} + 2ue^{2x} \)
   - \( y'' = u''e^{2x} + 4u'e^{2x} + 4ue^{2x} \)

2. **Substitute into the Original Equation**: Replace \( y, y', y'' \) in the differential equation:
   - The equation simplifies to: 
     \[
     (u''e^{2x} + 4u'e^{2x} + 4ue^{2x}) - 4(u'e^{2x} + 2ue^{2x}) + 4ue^{2x} = 0
     \]
   - Simplifying further, this reduces to:
     \[
     u''e^{2x} = 0
     \]

3. **Solve for \( u \)**: Since \( e^{2x} \neq 0 \), it follows that \( u'' = 0 \).

4. **Integrate**: Integrate twice to find \( u \):
   - First integration gives \( u' = c_1 \)
   - Second integration gives \( u = c_1 x + c_2 \)

5. **Back-Substitute for \( y \)**: Since \( y = u \cdot e^{2x} \), substitute back:
   - \( y = (c_1 x + c_2) e^{2x} \)
   - This simplifies to the general solution:
     \[
     y = c_1 x e^{2x} + c_2 e^{2x}
     \]

The solutions \( x e^{2x} \) and \( e^{2x} \) are linearly independent, forming a complete set of solutions for the differential equation.
