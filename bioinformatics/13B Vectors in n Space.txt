Good, let's move on to Euclidean in space. And what we're trying to do now, again, nothing new, we're going to take distance, norm, and angle. These are things we've dealt with before in linear algebra. And we've just got to express them, or just turn our minds a bit and express them so that we do fit this into this R in space.
So the first concept is this Euclidean inner product, and that is nothing but the dot product. Yeah, so that's vector u dot and vector v. So if I have these two vectors in three space, and I get the Euclidean inner product, that is going to be u1 v1 plus u2 v2 plus u3 v3. Nothing spectacular there.
Now let's look at the properties of Euclidean inner product, which we see now for our two space and three space is exactly the same as the dot product. So vector u dot product vector v, that will equal dot product vector v dot product vector u.
And if I have this vector v dot product vector v, that will be equal to vector u dot product vector v plus vector v dot product vector v.
If I have k times k times k times the scalar times this vector vector v.
And if I use that dot product vector v, that will be the same as k times first the dot product of those two vectors.
And vector v dot product vector v is always more than zero.
it can be zero
if vector v is a zero
vector, then you can get zero
equal to or greater than zero
it will only be equal to
if v is that, and think about it
maybe I could put some negatives in
you have to do that, say negative
a thousand, one comma
two, well the other one is also negative
a thousand, comma one
comma two, and a thousand
times a thousand
that's a million, but it's positive
and that's positive, and that's positive
I'm always going to add positive numbers to each other
no matter where I have my negatives
because these two must be exactly the same
as v dot product with itself
it's always going to be zero, unless of course
all of these are zero
then I can get zero
now that we know those properties
which is nothing new, it's very simple
for us to solve this, this is nothing
more than you would just know from
algebra, in as much as
I can now have
three times vector u dot product
four u plus the v
and I can have
like plus
two v
and dot product net width
four u
plus the v
and I can rewrite this
as three u dot product
four u
plus the three u dot product
dot product
dot product
dot product with
where am I
v
plus the two v dot product
four u
and I can have
two v dot product with v
here I can have
twelve times vector u dot product vector u
plus I have
plus I have
three times
three times
now I must be careful
I must be very careful
u dot v
now there's a dot product there
so if I multiply the error
if I multiply the scalar
and it's not three u dot
and three v
if I told you what is three times xy
then this is going to be three xy
not three x three y
there's a plus sign in there
so it becomes three x plus three y
okay so that's not what we're dealing with
plus the same here
I can have an eight
and then I'll have v dot u
but I remember I said u dot v equals v dot u
so that'll also be a u dot v
and plus two times v dot v
so I'm going to have twelve u dot u
this is really simple stuff
plus I'm going to have eight
eleven of these
u dot v
and I'm going to have two v dot v
easy enough
let's just have the norm
and the distance
in Euclidean n space
first of all the norm
if I have my vector u here
in three spaces
u1, u2, u3
and I'm asking for the norm
of vector u
well that's very simple
that is vector u dot product vector u
to the power of a half
what does that be called?
that's the square root of u1 squared
plus u2 squared
plus u3 squared
remember?
if I have u1, u2, and u3
and I have another u1, u2, u3
that is going to be
if I get the dot product of these
that is going to be
u1 times u1
which in other words is u1 squared
to that I add u2 squared
and u3 squared
so what I've done here
which is the one you might
be more familiar with
is the fact that I've just
taken the dot product
of that vector with itself
dot product between two of the
same of those to the power of half
or taking the square root
now perhaps for something
ever so slightly more challenging
not really
and this pertains to the fact
that I can interchange points and vectors
because here I have vector
a point u and point v
imagine that point u and point v
that will be
three values for coordinates
in x, y, and z direction
x, y, and z direction
if you want to see it geometrically
but now remember
I can't do that on a board
I mean I'm even trying to do
three space on a two dimensional space
there's no way I can do four space
but that needn't concern you
let's just do it in three space
I want the distance
this distance between them
well what I can do
is just to see these
it's two vectors
that's vector u
and there's vector v
and how do I get there?
how do I get to this distance?
well I can turn that into a vector as well
so what if I have
what if I tell you
I take vector u minus vector v
what if I do that?
so what would negative vector v be?
well negative vector v is this thing down here
and what if I add now
u plus negative v
so look carefully what I'm doing geometrically
I have vector u
and to that I add vector negative v
so I'm doing a head to tail thing
because I'm adding the tail head
now I need to put this thing's tail by this one's head
so I'm going to do this
I'm going to do this
and if I add these two to each other
what do I have left?
I have this thing left
which is nothing different from this one
absolutely nothing different
so for me to get the distance between these two points
I've just subtracted
changed them into vectors
in my mind
it hasn't really changed at all
and I subtract one from the other one
now to get the distance
I just need to know how long this is
because this one and that one is equally long
they are equally long
these two are parallel to each other
they are of equal length
those two will be parallel to equal length
okay
anyone can see this
so now I just need to get the norm of u minus v
if I get the norm of that
so I'm going to do this first
to get a new vector
and that vector
say that vector we call that vector p
vector p will be p1, p2, p3
and with that vector p now
if that equals u minus v
I'm just calling it p for no particular reason whatsoever
that's my new resultant vector
and if I want the norm of that
remember now that's this p dot product
p dot product of vector p to the power of a half
in other words p1 squared plus p2 squared plus p3
so it's squared
easy
let's do a quick example then
I have two vectors now in four space
now suddenly in four space
what is the length of vector u
what is the length of vector u
in other words
the norm of vector u
that is going to be the dot product of vector u with itself
to the power of a half
which is going to be
1 squared plus 3 squared
plus negative 2 squared
plus 7 squared
and you can get that on your calculator
and just get the answer
I think the answer is something like
3 squared root 7
3 squared root 7
so 3 times 3 is 9
9
what is 9 times 7
now we're going to 63
that's the square root of 63
and how far are these two points from each other
well there is just going to be
now again I've seen those as
four dimensional coordinate points
and how far are they apart
well I'm just going to subtract them from each other
and get the norm of that
that's going to equal
what is that equal?
it is u minus v
dot product u minus v
and all of that to the power of a half
so what is that going to leave me?
all the way there
so I'm going to have u minus v
1 minus 0
that's 1 squared
plus 3 minus 7
is negative 4
negative 4 squared
plus negative 2
minus 2 is negative 4
negative 4 squared
plus 7 minus 2
is 5 squared
so the distance between those two points
we write it as such
the distance
and the answer is going to be
square root
square root 58
so the distance
u comma v
equals the square root of
what did I say now?
58
and as much as we have
16
and 16
is 32
33
33 plus 25
is going to equal
8
5 squared
of 58
now we've even come across this before
the gauchy-schwarz
inequality
and then it says
if u and v are vectors in n space
so they're in the same space
then the absolute value of the dot product
the euclidean inner product
of the two vectors
is always going to be
smaller than or equal to
the norm of the two vectors
and this is one form of it
we'll look at some others later
another later
that if you just remember
from our previous discussions
u dot v
that's the same as the norm of u
wait
times the norm of v
times the cosine of the angle between them
and remember
we always need to do
the smallest angle
and those are my two vectors
I don't take this angle
I take this angle
as the angle between them
that means it's from 0 to 180 degrees
and the cosine of that
will always be from
as a cosine curve
in other words
we can only go from 1
to negative 1
so this
unless
unless
the distance between them
is
90 degrees
pi radians
which makes this 0
which makes this 0
anything else
well
think about that
if that makes a 0
this is 0
and 0 is going to be less than
the norms
which are always positive numbers
multiplied with each other
if it's anything between 1
and
negative 1
this is always going to be a fraction
which will make
that
the same as that
and this is a fraction
so it's always going to be less than
ok
unless
the angle between them
is
0 degrees
which makes this 1
then they'll be equal
hence the equal sign
or if it's negative 1
if it's negative 1
and as much as it is
pi radians there
it will also be
that the negative this
which is smaller
which is smaller than this
looks
