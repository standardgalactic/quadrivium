The text describes solving a non-homogeneous linear differential equation \( y'' - 4y' + 4y = g(x) \) using two methods: undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters. 

### Key Points:

1. **Homogeneous Solution**: The homogeneous part, \( y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0 \), has solutions:
   - \( y_1 = e^{2x} \)
   - \( y_2 = x e^{2x} \)

2. **Method of Undetermined Coefficients**:
   - A particular solution is guessed in the form: 
     \[ y_p = u_1(x) e^{2x} + u_2(x) x e^{2x} \]
   - Functions \( u_1(x) = ax^2 \) and \( u_2(x) = bx^3 \) are proposed.
   - Solving for coefficients, we find:
     - \( a = \frac{1}{2} \)
     - \( b = 6 \)
   - Resulting particular solution: 
     \[ y_p = \frac{1}{2} x^2 e^{2x} + 6x^3 e^{2x} \]

3. **Variation of Parameters**:
   - This method uses the homogeneous solutions to construct a particular solution.
   - It involves solving:
     \[
     u_1'(x) y_1(x) + u_2'(x) y_2(x) = 0
     \]
     \[
     u_1'(x) y_1'(x) + u_2'(x) y_2'(x) = g(x)
     \]
   - Integrating to find \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Both methods should yield the same particular solution, verifying the guessed form was correct.
   - The appearance of \( e^{2x} \) and \( x e^{2x} \) in the particular solution is consistent with both methods due to their roots in the differential operator's structure.

Both methods are valid for linear equations with constant coefficients, though variation of parameters does not rely on guessing.
