The text describes solving a differential equation and analyzing its solution using numerical methods. The differential equation given is \( y' = 4xy \). Through separation of variables, integration, and exponentiation, the general solution is derived as:

\[ y(x) = e^{2x^2 + C} \]

Using the initial condition \( y(1) = 1 \), we determine the constant \( C \) to be \( -2 \), resulting in:

\[ y(x) = e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

The first derivative is found to be:

\[ y'(x) = 4x e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

The second derivative involves applying the product rule:

\[ y''(x) = (16x^2 + 4) e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

The text then discusses estimating local truncation error using a step size \( h = 0.1 \). It calculates \( y''(c) \), where \( c \) is between \( x_n \) and \( x_{n+1} \), taking the maximum value at \( x = 1.1 \):

\[ y''(1.1) = (16 \times 1.1^2 + 4) e^{2 \times 1.1^2 - 2} \approx 35.553 \]

The error bound for one step of a numerical method is given by:

\[ \text{Error} = \frac{h^2}{2} \times y''(c) \]

Plugging in the values, the estimated maximum error for the first step using the specified \( h \) is approximately 0.1778. The text hints at using a method like Weller's to proceed with further steps while maintaining error control.
