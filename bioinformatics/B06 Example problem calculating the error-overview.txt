The text describes solving a differential equation and analyzing its solution using numerical methods. The differential equation given is \( y' = 4xy \). Through separation of variables, integration, and exponentiation, the general solution is derived as:

\[ y(x) = e^{2x^2 + C} \]

Using the initial condition \( y(1) = 1 \), we determine the constant \( C \) to be \( -2 \), resulting in:

\[ y(x) = e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

The first derivative is found to be:

\[ y'(x) = 4x e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

The second derivative involves applying the product rule:

\[ y''(x) = (16x^2 + 4) e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

The text then discusses estimating local truncation error using a step size \( h = 0.1 \). It calculates \( y''(c) \), where \( c \) is between \( x_n \) and \( x_{n+1} \), taking the maximum value at \( x = 1.1 \):

\[ y''(1.1) = (16 \times 1.1^2 + 4) e^{2 \times 1.1^2 - 2} \approx 35.553 \]

The error bound for one step of a numerical method is given by:

\[ \text{Error} = \frac{h^2}{2} \times y''(c) \]

Plugging in the values, the estimated maximum error for the first step using the specified \( h \) is approximately 0.1778. The text hints at using a method like Weller's to proceed with further steps while maintaining error control.

The text describes solving a differential equation \( y' = 4xy \) using integration. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Solving the Differential Equation**:
   - The given differential equation is solved by separating variables and integrating both sides.
   - After integration, you get: \( \ln|y| = 2x^2 + C \).
   - Solving for \( y \), we have \( y = Ce^{2x^2} \).

2. **Applying Initial Condition**:
   - With the initial condition \( y(1) = 1 \), you find \( C = e^{-2} \).
   - Therefore, the solution is \( y(x) = e^{2x^2 - 2} \).

3. **Finding Derivatives**:
   - First derivative: \( y'(x) = 4xe^{2x^2 - 2} \).
   - Second derivative using product rule: 
     \[
     y''(x) = 4e^{2x^2-2} + 16x^2 e^{2x^2-2}
     \]
     Simplified to \( y''(x) = (4 + 16x^2)e^{2x^2 - 2} \).

4. **Local Truncation Error**:
   - Starting at \( x_0 = 1 \), with step size \( h = 0.1 \).
   - At \( x = 1.1 \), calculate the maximum of the second derivative: 
     \[
     y''(c) = 4 + 16(1.1)^2 e^{2(1.1)^2 - 2}
     \]
     This evaluates approximately to 35.553.
   - The local truncation error is \( \text{Error} = \frac{h^2}{2} \times y''(c) \), yielding an approximate value of 0.1778.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The text concludes by noting the maximum error for the first step using a numerical method (likely referring to a Runge-Kutta or similar method) is approximately 0.1778, with \( h = 0.1 \). 

The explanation involves solving the differential equation analytically and calculating derivatives to estimate errors in a numerical solution process.
