Now in the previous lecture you saw how we relate area under a curve with probability
or the p-value. Now when we compare the means of two groups or even more, the computer actually
draws two types of graphs for us of which we can take the area under the curve. One
is called a z-distribution and one is called a t-distribution. With a z-distribution we
really have to know what the population standard deviation is. Most of the time we don't know
that and we use the t-distribution. Have a look at this.
