Another very good problem. One gram of radium contains 2.69 times 10 to the power of 21 newti.
So if I have one gram of this radium, 2 to 4, with that atomic mass units,
and then it goes alpha decay to radon 220 with that atomic mass units,
and the same for an alpha particle. I want to know if it has a half-life, this radium, of 3.66 days.
After 3.66 days, how much ice at 0 degrees Celsius in kilograms can I melt
if the latent heat of fusion of ice is 33.5, I think, yeah, 33.5 joules per kilogram.
How do I solve this problem? Quite easy, inasmuch as I do remember the Q,
the heat transfer, energy transfer as heat equals the latent heat of fusion times mass.
In other words, mass is equal to less energy divided by the latent heat of fusion of ice.
So all I need is this amount of energy.
This amount of energy.
How much energy can I get from alpha decay?
That's easy enough to do for us, because we know that we're going to have
224 radon is going to give us a radium. It's going to give us 220 radium, a radon,
plus an alpha particle, plus some energy.
Plus an alpha particle, plus some energy.
In other words, I can get the amount of energy by just adding the atomic mass units of these two
and subtracting it from the radium.
And that leaves me, oh, I wonder if I did it some way, some way, some way on the board.
I must have that 6.215, 6.215 times 10 to the power, negative 3 units.
I can convert that into mega electron volts, 9.3, 90, 1.5 times 6 to the power 6 electron volts per unit.
So I get rid of my units, and I can't convert this to joules, 10 to the power, negative 19 joules per one electron volt.
So I'm going to have an excellent number of joules, and I think I've got it there on the board, 9.274 times 10 to the power, negative 13 joules.
So I certainly know what energy I can get out of alpha decay, but all I'm doing here is I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, there's alpha decay of only one single, one single nucleus.
But I've got many of them to start off with, I've got many of them to start off with, and after 3.66 days I will have lost a certain number,
and that number that I've lost, if I multiply this by what I get from just one, I'm going to get the total number of energy that I do have at my disposal, at my disposal now.
So I just need to know how many, how many have decayed in 3.66 days, and I do know an equation for that,
and as much as the number that is left equals the number that I start with, times e to the power negative decay constant times the time that I have.
I data the decay constant for radium, but I can work it out, and as much as the decay constant is going to be 0.693, or the natural log of 2, divided by the half-life.
Divided by the half-life, and if I just use days, if I just use days for now, I'm going to get 0.1, what is it, 0.189, 0.189 per day.
And how much time do I have? Well, a question asked after 3.66 days, after 3.66 days, so I'm going to have n equals n0,
which is 2.69 times 10 to the power of 21, times e to the power of negative, 0.189 inverse days times 3.66 days,
and that gives me an n value of, I think, 1.34 times 10 to the power of 21.
That is how much is left after 3.66 days.
So I have, apologies there, the card was full.
I was about to say that now I have the number of, I can get now the number of nuclei that I have left after 3.66 days.
If I subtract this from where I started, that means the number of those that have decayed,
and if I multiply that number by the number of joules that I get from just a single decay,
that gives me the total number of energy that I can put in there divided by this latent heat of fusion,
that gives me a mass of about 3.71 times 10 to the power of 3 kilograms.
3.71, 3,710 kilograms.
That is three, more than three and a half tons of ice that I can melt after one day's alpha decay
of just a single gram of radium 224.
Thank you.
