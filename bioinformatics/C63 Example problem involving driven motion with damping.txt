So we have a problem here. You'll see it's a linear non-homogeneous second-order ordinary
differential equation with initial value problems. So this is that capital F of
T that's introduced on the right hand side. First of all I have to have a leading 1 coefficient of
1 as far as this equation is concerned. I've got a multiplier throughout by 5 that's going to leave
me with x prime prime plus 6x prime plus 10x equals 25 cosine of 4t. The first part I'm going to do is
the complementary part. In other words writing this in differential form 6d plus 10 of x equals well
25 on the right hand side I'm going to set equal to 0. In other words I can use my auxiliary equation
see that this is going to have to include a complex number so m is going to equal negative 6 plus minus
the square root of 36 minus this negative 4 so it's negative 2 squared divided by 2 times a which is
just 2. That leaves me with m equals negative 3 plus minus that it's just going to be 1 that's just going to be i.
In other words alpha equals negative 3 and beta equals 1. To support that out 2 divided by 2 is just 1 so
square root of negative 1 is just i. In other words x the complementary complementary solution here is going to be
e to the power negative 3t and then we're going to have c sub 1 cosine of just t plus c sub 2 sine of t
because this is an initial value problem we'll have to do the first derivative of this later on so let's do
just distribute e to the power negative 3t into the equation there. So if I have some marker
these problems become so long you just lose track of where things are. This is pink so that's the first one I'm going to have to remember to bring into my solution. Now I've got to do
x the particular part of x. So on the right hand side I now have this
yeah so let's work from this equation on the right hand side I have that
and if we use we can use various methods I think the annihilate approach is going to be a bit difficult because we're going to end up with an auxiliary equation
that is m to the power of 4 and to get the roots of that might be a bit difficult
therefore instead of using the annihilate approach let's use the method of undetermined coefficients
and so we're going to assume that xp is going to equal some let's make it a cosine of 4t plus b sine of 4t
we're assuming that it's going to have this form so that will leave the x prime as we just got to do the
differentiate this twice because that's what we're looking for so that's going to be negative 4 times a times the sine of 4t
plus 4 times b cosine of 4t and if I look at x double prime so p of t that is going to be negative 16 a cosine of 4t and negative 16 b sine of 4t
so I've got to reconstruct this equation with this with this knowledge these three so I have x double prime in other words negative 16 a cosine of 4t
in other words negative 16 a cosine of 4t minus 16 b sine of 4t I've got to add to that 6 times x prime so it's going to be 6 times this it's negative 24 a times the sine of 4t plus 24 b cosine of 4t
plus 10 times b sine of 4t plus 10 times b sine of 4t and that is going to equal 25 times the cosine of 4t you could say plus 0 times the sine of 4t
so let's take the cosine of 4t so let's take the cosine of 4t out as a common factor let's see that leaves us with a negative 16 a
as far as the cosines are concerned a plus 24 b plus 10 a and add to that the sine of t's
sine of t's looks like it's a negative 16 b and negative 24 a and a plus 10 b and that's going to equal
a 25 cosine of 4t plus a zero times the sine of 4t there's no nothing of that that means let's do the
second one first so that's going to be negative 6 b minus 24 a is going to equal zero as far as the
sine of t's are concerned so we can just express b as negative 4a it looks like i'm bringing that over
to the other side divided by 6 that's correct and here we're going to have a negative 6 a
is that correct we have a minus plus 10 plus 24 times negative 4a b and that's going to equal 25
so 24 times 4 is 96 negative 96 that's negative 102 a equals 25 but you can still see there i'm just
solving for a there so if we do this we can say that a equals negative 25 over 102 i don't think that
makes it any easier and b is going to equal negative 4 times that that's 100 negative 4 times that so it's
100 over 102 that looks like 50 over 51 and that won't make it any easier so i can construct x of t
being we can pull all these together that is going to be
c sub 1 c sub 1 e to the power negative 3t cosine of t plus c sub 2 e to the power negative 3t sine of t
and then the x of p a we know now what a and b is so that's going to be a is going to be minus 25 over 102
cosine of cosine of 40 and b is going to be 50 over 51 sine of 4t so that's the ones that's the
full solution but this is an initial value problem so we know that the x of 0 equals a half
so if i just plug in 0 in here 0 in there that's going to be c sub 1 for that one
signs will disappear because sine of 0 is 0 and this is going to be minus 25 over 102 that leaves c
equaling c sub 1 equaling well that's 25 over 102 plus if i do that 102 that's 51 that i've left with there
so that leaves me with let me get my calculator rather before i make too many horrible mistakes
55 over 102 and we add to that 51 over 102 that leaves me 38 over 51 for c sub 1
we can't we have to get the x prime of t if we had to solve for if we had to solve for
c sub 2 but what we do note is you know we're going to have we're going to have x prime of 0 equals 0 so
all the signs i can actually leave out if i do this differentiation of this okay so look at this
this is a product of two functions in t so i've got to use the product rule the first part of which i'm
going to get the first derivative of this which is negative 3 times c sub 1 e to the power negative 3t
cosine of t but now the other part is going to bring me a sine of t but i want the sine of 0 which is just
going to disappear so i'm going to leave that out same here if i get the derivative of this sine of t
let's rather just get the second part of that so that's going to be a negative uh positive
does that c sub 2 e to the power negative 3t cosine of t i'm going to leave the other one out here we're
just going to have a sine and here we're going to have a cosine so it's going to be positive 200 over 51
cosine of 4t and all the others combined it's always going to be it's always going to be
a zero but let's call it some some other function of t all of those put together and we let the g of
zero equals zero because i mean i'm going to have all those signs in here as well and every time i take a
zero it's going to be zero so we said that that equals zero by the initial so that's going to
equal negative three c sub one we know is 38 over 51 um e to the power that's a one that's a one plus c
sub two is the one we're interested in that is one that is one that is one plus 200 over 51
so i'm going to have the fact that c sub 2 is going to equal let's do that that is going to be
3 times 38 over 51 take it to the other side and we're going to subtract from there 200 over 51
that leaves us negative 86 over 51. eventually now we can write the x of t equals
where where was our first answer so we're going to have e to the power negative 3t
c sub 1 is well let's just mark them out there's c sub 1 there's c sub 2 so that is 38 over 51
cosine of now cosine of t
and c sub 2 is negative 86 over 51 sine of t and then i've got to add to that
the negative 25 over 102 cosine of 4t and 50 over 51 sine of 4t
