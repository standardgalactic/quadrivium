This video discusses numerical integration techniques, specifically focusing on Simpson's sums. It builds on previous discussions of Riemann and trapezoidal sums by introducing a method where areas under curves are divided into equal segments or bases. Unlike earlier methods that use rectangles, Simpson’s method approximates the area using parabolas for each pair of bases.

In this approach, two adjacent bases are used to form a parabolic shape, which is symmetric around its midpoint. The equation of this parabola is derived by fitting it through three points: \((-h, y_0)\), \( (0, y_1) \), and \((h, y_2)\). Integrating the area under this parabola from \(-h\) to \(h\) results in an expression involving these y-values.

The key formula derived for the area under one pair of bases is: 

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\Delta x}{3} (y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2)
\]

where \(\Delta x\) (delta x) is the width of each base, calculated as \((b-a)/n\), with \(n\) being an even number. The pattern continues for subsequent pairs of bases, with coefficients alternating between 1, 4, and 2 in the final formula.

The complete Simpson's sum for estimating the area under a curve from \(a\) to \(b\) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta x}{3} (y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + \ldots + 2y_{n-2} + 4y_{n-1} + y_n)
\]

This method provides a more accurate approximation than simpler methods by better capturing the curvature of the function.

This video continues a series on numerical integration by exploring Simpson's sum method. After discussing Riemann sums and trapezoidal sums, it focuses on how Simpson’s method approximates the area under a curve using parabolic segments rather than rectangles or trapezoids.

In Simpson's method, the interval \([a, b]\) is divided into an even number of equal subintervals (bases), each with width \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\). The bases are paired because each pair forms a parabolic segment. For the first two bases at points \(x_0\) and \(x_2\), a parabola is fitted through these points and an additional midpoint, creating a shape with a parabolic top and straight sides.

The equation of this parabola, passing through \((-h, y_0)\), \((0, y_1)\), and \((h, y_2)\) where \(h = \Delta x/2\), is integrated over the interval from \(-h\) to \(h\). This integration results in an expression for the area under the parabola: 

\[ \frac{\Delta x}{3} (y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2) \]

This pattern continues with pairs of bases, adding up the areas using coefficients 1, 4, and 2 alternately. The general formula for Simpson’s sum to estimate the area under a curve from \(a\) to \(b\) is:

\[ \frac{\Delta x}{3} (y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \ldots + 4y_{n-1} + y_n) \]

This formula highlights the alternating coefficients of 1, 4, and 2, except for the first and last terms which have a coefficient of 1.
