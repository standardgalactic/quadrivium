The text describes how conjugation in a group \( G \) can be viewed as a group action on the set \( A \), which consists of all elements of \( G \). Conjugation involves transforming an element \( A \) using another element \( G \) through the operation \( GAG^{-1} \).

This transformation is expressed as a group action: \( G.A = GAG^{-1} \), where each element of \( G \) permutes or rearranges other elements in the set. For this to be a valid group action, two conditions must be met:

1. **Compatibility with Group Operation**: The action of the product of two group elements on \( A \) should equal the composition of their individual actions:
   \[
   (G_1 G_2)A = G_1(G_2A)
   \]

2. **Identity Action**: The identity element \( E \) must act as an identity permutation:
   \[
   EA = A
   \]

The text confirms that these properties are satisfied by conjugation, establishing it as a group action.

In the case of abelian groups (where elements commute), conjugation results in the element itself: \( GAG^{-1} = A \). This means every conjugation becomes an identity permutation, with each element mapping to itself without rearrangement. This highlights a unique characteristic of abelian groups where all elements are invariant under conjugation.
