Here's a simple trigonometric problem. We are asked to get the indefinite integral of the cosine of 2x with respect to x.
We have to use some form of substitution here since we don't have a simple function in x.
So let us have u equal 2x. That will leave us with the du dx of 2. If we rewrite this that would be the cosine then of u dx.
So we ask to get the indefinite integral of the cosine of u with respect to x. And we can't do that. We certainly have to get rid of the dx.
So in our equation here we can have dx equals a half du. If we substitute that we have the cosine of u half with respect to u.
We can use the constant multiple rule. Bring out the half. That is the indefinite integral of the cosine of u with respect to u.
And that would be a half. What is the anti-derivative of the cosine of u?
Well that will be the sine of u. This is indefinite. So plus c. We will substitute back our value of u.
That will leave us with the sine then of 2x plus c.
Let's see.
