there we go carry on so we've got our second data frame there by just chucking out some of the values
from our previous data frame let's go on and add a new column to our original
data frame here so remember that's how to do it you say data underscore two
and just put these square brackets and then the name of the column in inverted commas and i'm going
to add this list but look at this list this list is a list of text strings a b a b a b so what we can
say let's well let's just execute that you'll see let's see what it looks like so it's added this
so let's imagine something let's imagine this was admission hemoglobin values of a set of patients
this was that patients each individual patient's white cell count and let's imagine that the
patients belong to two groups either the patient was in group a or group b so that would be normal
kind of analysis that we would be interested in and now the beauty of pandas you can split your
data frames up i'm going to create a new data frame called data underscore four i'm going to take data
two and i'm going to use this method the group by method and i wanted to go to the groups column
so then underscore two dot so you'll have to learn when to use square brackets when to use these round
brackets when to use a dot you'll get used to it so i want to group by this so it's going to look down
this column and it's going to see i find a's and b's if there were c's i would find c's if it was a lot of
other words it will just group all the similar ones together let's do that and i'll show you what the
result is now this is really magic as i say there look at this still columns var one and var two
but now it's made two individual groups it will only take the values that had fell into the a group
and the b group so if you had two groups and you wanted to compare them to each other you'll want to
do statistical analysis comparing the two groups it'll actually split your data frame like that now we can
see there were seven patients in group a and six patients in group b and in the group a patients
that was their mean that was their standard deviation etc and that really is the power
so that's a short introduction to pandas let me show you how we're going to use pandas
most of the time we're going to import a spreadsheet
now in spreadsheet software in microsoft excel it usually exports it as xls or xlsx files
you can also in the library office open office export it as open document spreadsheet format but
you can also ask those programs to export it as a csv file comma separated values and this is the one
i'm going to use here so inside of the same folder now i'm just going to show you here i'm in my desktop
healthcare research lectures folder on my computer that is where this notebook lives and i've put this csv
file in exactly the same folder as where this notebook lives that means i don't have to refer to
i don't have to type in the whole um the whole wherever it was c desktop whatever for mac windows
all different i don't have to do that i can just put the name of the file but please if you want to
keep a thing simple like this put your spreadsheet file in the same folder as where your notebook lives
it'll find it easily now pd pandas we know what that is dot so not series not data frame this time i'm
going to say read csv and there's a read xls read xlsx so if you've saved your spreadsheet file in a
different format there's a read there's all sorts of read ones that you could do so it's going to take
this whole spreadsheet and it's going to put it inside of this computer bucket called data 5
and let's do that and i just want to show you when you import a spreadsheet file let's just see what
data type it's going to be yes indeed it is a data frame so it's going to look exactly like this
so if you import if you import a whole spreadsheet remember data frame allows for lots of different
columns it is going to be that now there's a quick way that you can just check if things imported
properly and that's using this this method head so if i typed in data dot 5 let me show you data
underscore 5 dot if i say h and hit tab head is the one double click on that open and close the default
is five so see that that was in blue you don't have to put that if you leave it empty it's going
to accept an argument default of five it's just going to show me the first five rows and it's
just a quick you don't want to if you have a spreadsheet with thousands and thousands of rows
you don't want to print them all out to the screen but you just want to make sure things imported
properly so just that and there's our beautiful little spreadsheet and i'm only showing the first
five rows you see there the index always starts counting at zero so let me run through the spreadsheet
quickly because this is the one we're going to use most of the time it's mock mock there you see
so mox is mock data doesn't come from any real patient but we have file column the patient's file
their age their gender delay from the time they had symptoms until they came to the hospital how long
they stayed in the hospital did they go to icu what is their retroviral disease status was a cd4 count
done nan is a term used in computer languages quite a lot if it finds an empty space or something that's
not a value in a value column with values it's going to put nan stands for not a number
and it's very nice to have that done because these values will be excluded when you do statistical analysis
on the values in this column admission heart rate admission temperature admission c reactive protein
admission white cell count admission hb was there at surgery was the finding of rupture of the appendix
this is appendix data appendix in the way for histology was there inflammation yes or no
did the patient develop any complications while they stayed in hospital and what was the modified alvarado score
you don't have to worry about this clinical setting at all you don't have to know anything about appendicitis
we won't go into dealing with a clinical situation as much i just want to show you now how to do
statistical analysis on this data set that we have now it might very well be i just want to show you
that you don't like this index you can change any of these columns to be the index don't be
silly about it though you see the file contains unique numbers and if you're quite ever interested in
doing that you can say data underscore five that is the data frames name dot set underscore index
open and close these brackets and just put the name in in quote quotation marks the name of you have to
type it in exactly that was file was the name of that column and i'm going to print to the screen the first
three after making my change let's do that now file becomes the index file becomes the index sometimes
though you only want to display the last few lines that makes it very quickly to see how many of your
rows actually imported so instead of head there's also a tail let's just do the last three and you can
see the the last three up to file number 150 so there are 150 patients in our data set so that's a
quick introduction to pandas look through it again familiar familiarize yourself with it play with it
it might look slightly daunting especially this first bit we are not going to construct things in
this way but i just wanted to slowly introduce you to pandas this is the way we're going to do it by
just importing spreadsheet files and start playing with them excellent see you in the next lecture
