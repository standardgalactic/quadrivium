The management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves several key steps, starting with the initial pre-hospital care following Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles. In patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 3 and 8, maintaining systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg and oxygen saturation over 90% is crucial, achieved through intravenous fluid resuscitation and either supplemental oxygen or intubation.

Intubation is mandatory for these patients regardless of their ability to maintain airway and breathing due to the risk of deterioration. Spine protection is essential in all severe TBI cases.

Upon hospital admission, a CT scan should be performed if there's any history of loss of consciousness, serving as both standard care and medical-legal protocol. Patients with mild or moderate TBI require close monitoring in a trauma unit, with neurochecks every 15 minutes to watch for signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as nausea, vomiting, new headaches, restlessness, pupillary asymmetry, seizures, or increasing lethargy.

Routine blood tests should include full blood count, electrolytes, CMP, blood gas analysis (especially focusing on partial oxygen pressure), and coagulation studies. Tetanus prophylaxis is also recommended for trauma patients.

For severe TBI with symptoms, a CT scan of the spine is advised if there's spinal tenderness or already undergoing head CT imaging. However, low-velocity gunshot wounds may not necessitate spine immobilization and CT in all cases, although it remains a safety measure to perform them when possible.

To manage intracranial pressure (ICP), strategies include controlled ventilation, types of fluid administration like mannitol, but not steroids as they are ineffective for this purpose. The placement of an ICP monitor is recommended for patients with severe TBI and a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 3 to 8, especially if they have abnormal CT findings or meet specific criteria on a normal CT scan: systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, age over 40 years, or presence of unilateral/bilateral motor posturing.

The text discusses the use and benefits of monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) in medical settings. The primary advantages include early detection of increased ICP, management of different modalities to decrease ICP, and serving as a therapeutic measure by draining cerebrospinal fluid through a catheter.

Cerebral perfusion pressure, which is crucial for brain health, is calculated using the formula: mean blood pressure minus intracranial pressure. The goal is to maintain this pressure around 60 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) to avoid complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome that can result from fluid overload aimed at increasing pressure beyond this threshold.

The text also outlines when to start decreasing ICP, emphasizing the use of an ICP monitor. It suggests beginning interventions when intracranial pressures exceed 20-25 mmHg, with further discussion on methods to decrease ICP in subsequent discussions.

The text discusses the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) with a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 3 and 8. In the pre-hospital setting, adherence to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles is essential, focusing on airway, breathing, circulation, maintaining systolic pressure above 90 mmHg through intravenous fluid resuscitation, and ensuring oxygen saturation over 90%. All patients with severe TBI should be intubated regardless of their ability to maintain airway and breathing independently. Spine protection is critical for these patients.

Upon hospital admission, several key management points are highlighted:

1. **Imaging**: 
   - A CT scan of the brain is recommended if there's any history of loss of consciousness.
   - Patients with mild or moderate TBI should be monitored in a trauma unit with neurochecks every 15 minutes to detect signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as nausea, vomiting, worsening headaches, restlessness, pupillary asymmetry, seizures, and lethargy.

2. **Laboratory Tests**:
   - Blood alcohol level and urinary toxicology screen are important.
   - Routine blood tests include full blood count, urine electrolytes, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), blood gas analysis, and coagulation studies.
   - Tetanus prophylaxis is also necessary for trauma patients.

3. **Spinal Imaging**:
   - A CT scan of the spine is advised for all symptomatic severe TBI patients or those with tenderness in the spinal region. However, low-velocity gunshot wounds to the head may not require spine immobilization and imaging.

4. **Intracranial Pressure Management**:
   - Strategies include ventilation adjustments, fluid management (e.g., mannitol), and avoiding steroids.
   - The use of intracranial pressure monitors is considered for severe TBI patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 to 8, especially those with an abnormal CT scan or normal CT scans but meeting specific criteria such as age over 40, systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, or motor posturing.

The text emphasizes the importance of vigilant monitoring and timely interventions to manage severe TBI effectively.

The text discusses the use and benefits of monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) in managing cerebral perfusion pressure, which is crucial for brain health. Key points include:

1. **Early Detection**: Monitoring ICP allows for early detection of increased intracranial pressure, enabling timely intervention.

2. **Management of Modalities**: It helps manage various treatments aimed at reducing intracranial pressure.

3. **Therapeutic Use**: A catheter can be used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, aiding in decreasing ICP.

4. **Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)**: CPP is calculated as mean blood pressure minus ICP, and it's important to maintain it around 60 mmHg to avoid complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome from excessive fluid administration.

5. **Guidelines for Intervention**: Monitoring helps determine when to start interventions, particularly if ICP exceeds 20-25 mmHg.

The text sets the stage for discussing specific methods to decrease intracranial pressure in subsequent discussions.
