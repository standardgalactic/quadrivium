It looks like you are working through a series expansion, likely in the context of solving a differential equation using the Frobenius method. You've identified an indicial equation and calculated two roots \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( r_2 = 0 \). Based on these roots, you're trying to find the recurrence relation for the coefficients \( c_k \).

Here's a structured breakdown of what you're doing:

### Indicial Equation
You derived the indicial equation from your series expansion:
\[ r(2r - 1) = 0. \]

The solutions are:
- \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( r_2 = 0 \)

These roots determine the form of the series solution.

### Recurrence Relation
For each root, you derive a recurrence relation for the coefficients \( c_k \).

#### For \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \):
The recurrence relation is:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k (2k + 2r_1 + 1)}{(k + r_1 + 1)(2k + 2r_1 + 1)}. \]

Substituting \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k (2k + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1)}{(k + \frac{1}{2} + 1)(2k + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1)}. \]

Simplifying:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k (2k + 2)}{(k + \frac{3}{2})(2k + 2)}. \]

The \( (2k + 2) \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k}{k + \frac{3}{2}}. \]

#### For \( r_2 = 0 \):
The recurrence relation is similar:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k (2k + 1)}{(k + 1)(2k + 1)}. \]

Here, the \( (2k + 1) \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k}{k + 1}. \]

### Coefficient Calculation
Using these recurrence relations, you can calculate specific coefficients:

#### For \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \):
- \( c_1 = -\frac{c_0}{\frac{3}{2}} = -\frac{2}{3}c_0 \)
- \( c_2 = -\frac{c_1}{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5}c_0 = \frac{4}{15}c_0 \)

#### For \( r_2 = 0 \):
- \( c_1 = -\frac{c_0}{1} = -c_0 \)
- \( c_2 = -\frac{c_1}{2} = \frac{c_0}{2} \)

### General Pattern
For \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \), the coefficients follow:
\[ c_k = (-1)^k \frac{(2^k) c_0}{(k + \frac{1}{2})(k - \frac{1}{2}) \cdots (\frac{3}{2})}. \]

For \( r_2 = 0 \), the coefficients follow:
\[ c_k = (-1)^k \frac{c_0}{k!}. \]

These patterns allow you to construct the series solutions for each root. Each solution will be of the form:
- \( y_1(x) = x^{r_1} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k x^k \)
- \( y_2(x) = x^{r_2} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k x^k \)

These series solutions can then be used to solve the differential equation. If you have further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask!

The text discusses how to express mathematical sequences and series, particularly focusing on powers of negative numbers and factorials. It describes alternating signs in sequences (e.g., negative to the power of n) and explains how coefficients \( c_n \) can be calculated using factorial growth patterns.

Key points include:
- The sequence alternates between positive and negative values: \( (-1)^n \).
- For any given term, the coefficient \( c_n \) is determined by multiplying previous terms with increasing odd numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 5,...), leading to expressions like \( \frac{c_0}{1 \times 3 \times 5 \times \ldots} \).
- The text also introduces constructing power series using these coefficients: \( x^n \) and \( x^{n+r} \), where \( r \) is a constant (e.g., \( r = \frac{1}{2} \)).
- By substituting values into the series, it shows how to express functions in terms of their power series expansions.

Overall, the text provides a method for constructing and understanding sequences and series with alternating signs and factorial growth, useful in mathematical analysis and calculus.
