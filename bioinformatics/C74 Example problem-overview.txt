It looks like you are working through a series expansion, likely in the context of solving a differential equation using the Frobenius method. You've identified an indicial equation and calculated two roots \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( r_2 = 0 \). Based on these roots, you're trying to find the recurrence relation for the coefficients \( c_k \).

Here's a structured breakdown of what you're doing:

### Indicial Equation
You derived the indicial equation from your series expansion:
\[ r(2r - 1) = 0. \]

The solutions are:
- \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( r_2 = 0 \)

These roots determine the form of the series solution.

### Recurrence Relation
For each root, you derive a recurrence relation for the coefficients \( c_k \).

#### For \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \):
The recurrence relation is:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k (2k + 2r_1 + 1)}{(k + r_1 + 1)(2k + 2r_1 + 1)}. \]

Substituting \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k (2k + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1)}{(k + \frac{1}{2} + 1)(2k + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1)}. \]

Simplifying:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k (2k + 2)}{(k + \frac{3}{2})(2k + 2)}. \]

The \( (2k + 2) \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k}{k + \frac{3}{2}}. \]

#### For \( r_2 = 0 \):
The recurrence relation is similar:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k (2k + 1)}{(k + 1)(2k + 1)}. \]

Here, the \( (2k + 1) \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[ c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k}{k + 1}. \]

### Coefficient Calculation
Using these recurrence relations, you can calculate specific coefficients:

#### For \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \):
- \( c_1 = -\frac{c_0}{\frac{3}{2}} = -\frac{2}{3}c_0 \)
- \( c_2 = -\frac{c_1}{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5}c_0 = \frac{4}{15}c_0 \)

#### For \( r_2 = 0 \):
- \( c_1 = -\frac{c_0}{1} = -c_0 \)
- \( c_2 = -\frac{c_1}{2} = \frac{c_0}{2} \)

### General Pattern
For \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \), the coefficients follow:
\[ c_k = (-1)^k \frac{(2^k) c_0}{(k + \frac{1}{2})(k - \frac{1}{2}) \cdots (\frac{3}{2})}. \]

For \( r_2 = 0 \), the coefficients follow:
\[ c_k = (-1)^k \frac{c_0}{k!}. \]

These patterns allow you to construct the series solutions for each root. Each solution will be of the form:
- \( y_1(x) = x^{r_1} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k x^k \)
- \( y_2(x) = x^{r_2} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k x^k \)

These series solutions can then be used to solve the differential equation. If you have further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask!

The text discusses how to express mathematical sequences and series, particularly focusing on powers of negative numbers and factorials. It describes alternating signs in sequences (e.g., negative to the power of n) and explains how coefficients \( c_n \) can be calculated using factorial growth patterns.

Key points include:
- The sequence alternates between positive and negative values: \( (-1)^n \).
- For any given term, the coefficient \( c_n \) is determined by multiplying previous terms with increasing odd numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 5,...), leading to expressions like \( \frac{c_0}{1 \times 3 \times 5 \times \ldots} \).
- The text also introduces constructing power series using these coefficients: \( x^n \) and \( x^{n+r} \), where \( r \) is a constant (e.g., \( r = \frac{1}{2} \)).
- By substituting values into the series, it shows how to express functions in terms of their power series expansions.

Overall, the text provides a method for constructing and understanding sequences and series with alternating signs and factorial growth, useful in mathematical analysis and calculus.

It looks like you're working through a problem involving series solutions to differential equations, specifically dealing with indicial roots and recurrence relations. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Indicial Equation**: You've derived an indicial equation from the series expansion of a differential equation. The roots \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( r_2 = 0 \) are your indicial roots.

2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each root, you have a recurrence relation for the coefficients \( c_k \). This is crucial for finding the series solution to the differential equation.

3. **Root \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \)**:
   - The recurrence relation is given by:
     \[
     c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k}{2(k + r + 1)}
     \]
   - Substituting \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \), the relation becomes:
     \[
     c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k}{2(k + \frac{3}{2})}
     \]
   - Simplifying further, you get:
     \[
     c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k}{2k + 3}
     \]

4. **Calculating Coefficients**:
   - Start with \( k = 0 \):
     \[
     c_1 = -\frac{c_0}{3}
     \]
   - For \( k = 1 \):
     \[
     c_2 = -\frac{c_1}{5} = \frac{c_0}{15}
     \]
   - For \( k = 2 \):
     \[
     c_3 = -\frac{c_2}{7} = -\frac{c_0}{105}
     \]
   - The pattern suggests:
     \[
     c_k = (-1)^k \frac{c_0}{(2k+1)!!}
     \]
   - Here, \( (2k+1)!! \) denotes the double factorial, which is the product of all odd numbers up to \( 2k+1 \).

5. **Root \( r_2 = 0 \)**:
   - The recurrence relation becomes:
     \[
     c_{k+1} = -\frac{c_k}{2(k + 1)}
     \]
   - Start with \( k = 0 \):
     \[
     c_1 = -\frac{c_0}{2}
     \]
   - For \( k = 1 \):
     \[
     c_2 = -\frac{c_1}{4} = \frac{c_0}{8}
     \]
   - For \( k = 2 \):
     \[
     c_3 = -\frac{c_2}{6} = -\frac{c_0}{48}
     \]
   - The pattern suggests:
     \[
     c_k = (-1)^k \frac{c_0}{(2^k)k!}
     \]

These series solutions can be used to construct the general solution to the differential equation, often involving a linear combination of the two independent solutions corresponding to each root. If you have further questions or need clarification on any step, feel free to ask!

The text describes how to construct power series solutions for a particular equation using recursive relationships between coefficients. It focuses on the behavior of coefficients \( c_n \) that alternate in sign: negative, positive, negative, etc., and explains how they can be expressed in terms of factorials and powers.

Starting from \( c_0 \), each subsequent coefficient is derived by multiplying or dividing by factorial numbers. Specifically:

- \( c_1 = -\frac{c_0}{1} \)
- \( c_2 = \frac{-c_1}{2 \times 3} = \frac{c_0}{1 \times 3} \)
- \( c_3 = \frac{-c_2}{4 \times 5} = \frac{-c_0}{1 \times 3 \times 5} \)

This pattern indicates that each coefficient \( c_n \) is expressed as:

\[ c_n = (-1)^n \frac{c_0}{(2n-1)!!} \]

where \( (2n-1)!! \) denotes the double factorial of odd numbers up to \( 2n-1 \).

The series solution for the equation is then constructed by summing these coefficients multiplied by powers of \( x \):

\[ y(x) = c_0 \left( 1 + \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2 \times 3} + \frac{x^3}{2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5} + \ldots \right) x^{r_1} \]

where \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \).

The text also mentions constructing two series solutions, \( y_1(x) \) and \( y_2(x) \), using this method. The power series are straightforward to set up due to the recursive nature of the coefficients.
