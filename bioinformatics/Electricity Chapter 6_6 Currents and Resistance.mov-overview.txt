The text outlines a series of physics problems related to circuits and electrical power:

1. **Circuit Analysis with Batteries**:
   - Two batteries are connected in series, each with its own electromotive force (E1 = 4.4V, E2 = 2.1V) and internal resistance.
   - The circuit includes resistors: R1 (internal resistance of battery 1, 2.3 ohms), R2 (resistor between the batteries, 1.8 ohms), and an additional resistor (5.5 ohms).
   - To find the current in the circuit, use Kirchhoff's loop rule. The net electromotive force is E1 - E2, and total resistance includes internal resistances plus other resistors: R1 + R2 + 5.5.
   - Current I = (E1 - E2) / (R1 + R2 + 5.5).

2. **Potential Difference Across Battery Terminals**:
   - Calculate the potential difference across battery 1's terminals using the formula VB - VA = E1 - IR1, where I is the current calculated earlier.

3. **Terminal Potential Difference with Different Current Directions**:
   - If current flows from negative to positive terminal (against EMF), terminal voltage decreases: VB - VA = E - IR.
   - If current flows from positive to negative terminal (with EMF), terminal voltage increases: VB - VA = E + IR.
   - With no current, terminal potential difference equals EMF.

4. **Battery Energy and Cost Analysis**:
   - A standard flashlight battery delivers 2 watt-hours, equivalent to 7200 joules.
   - To power a 100-watt lamp for 8 hours (28800000 joules), you need 400 such batteries at $0.80 each, totaling $320.
   - Alternatively, if energy is sourced from the grid at 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, calculate cost based on energy consumption in joules.

These problems demonstrate circuit analysis techniques, battery terminal voltage calculations, and practical applications involving energy costs.

The text discusses comparing the cost of running a 100-watt light bulb for 8 hours using electricity at $0.06 per kilowatt-hour, versus using a battery to provide the same amount of energy. It calculates the electricity cost as follows: 

1. A 100-watt bulb running for 8 hours uses 2,880,000 joules (since 100 watts * 8 hours = 800 watt-hours = 2,880,000 joules).
2. At $0.06 per kilowatt-hour, the cost is determined by dividing the energy used (in joules) by the number of joules in a kilowatt-hour (3,600,000), then multiplying by the cost per kilowatt-hour: 
   \[
   \frac{2,880,000}{3,600,000} \times 0.06 = 4.8 \text{ cents}.
   \]

In contrast, using a battery that provides only 7,200 joules would cost $0.80. Thus, electricity at 6 cents per kilowatt-hour is significantly cheaper compared to the battery option.

The text discusses a circuit problem involving two batteries with internal resistances and an external resistor. The electromotive forces (EMFs) for the first and second batteries are 4.4 volts and 2.1 volts, respectively, while their internal resistances are 2.3 ohms each. An additional resistor has a resistance of 5.5 ohms.

To find the current in the circuit, we consider that it flows from the battery with higher EMF (Battery 1) to the one with lower EMF (Battery 2). The equation for the total voltage and resistance is derived as:

\[ I = \frac{E_1 - E_2}{R_1 + R_2 + r} \]

where \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) are the EMFs, \( R_1 \), \( R_2 \), and \( r \) are the resistances. Plugging in values:

\[ I = \frac{4.4 - 2.1}{5.5 + 1.8 + 2.3} \]

The potential difference between the terminals of Battery 1 is calculated using:

\[ V_{BA} = E_1 - Ir_1 \]

where \( r_1 \) is the internal resistance of Battery 1.

Additional scenarios are considered where a battery with an EMF of 12 volts and an internal resistance of 2 ohms is analyzed for terminal potential differences under different current directions, showing how the potential difference changes based on whether the current flows from negative to positive or vice versa. If no current flows, the potential difference equals the EMF.

Lastly, a practical example involving energy consumption is presented. A standard flashlight battery can deliver 2 watt-hours (7200 joules). To operate a 100-watt lamp for 8 hours requires significant energy (2.88 million joules), necessitating 400 such batteries at a cost of $320 if each costs 80 cents.

Alternatively, if electricity is priced at 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, the cost is calculated based on how much energy this price can deliver, emphasizing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of using electrical power versus individual batteries.

The text provides a comparison between running a 100-watt light bulb for 8 hours and using a battery to provide the same amount of energy. Running the light bulb requires 2.88 million joules, costing just 4.8 cents at an electricity rate of 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is calculated by dividing the total joules (2,880,000) by one million (to convert joules to kilowatt-hours) and then multiplying by the cost per kilowatt-hour (0.06). In contrast, a battery that provides only 7,200 joules costs about $0.80 (assuming 100 cents equals one dollar), making it much more expensive than electricity for the same energy output.
