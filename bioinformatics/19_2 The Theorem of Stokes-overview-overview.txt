The text provides an overview of Stokes' Theorem, originally attributed to Lord Kelvin (incorrectly called "Lord Calvin"), as it relates to vector calculus. It explains that the theorem extends Green's Theorem from two dimensions to three-dimensional space by connecting a closed line integral around a curve with a surface integral over the bounded surface. Specifically, Stokes' Theorem states that the line integral of a vector field \(\mathbf{f}\) dotted with \(d\mathbf{r}\) along a closed curve is equal to the double surface integral of the curl of \(\mathbf{f}\) dotted with the normal vector over the surface.

Key points discussed include:

1. **Unit Normal Vector**: The unit normal vector of a surface can be found by dividing the gradient of the function defining the surface by its norm, resulting in a perpendicular unit-length vector to the surface.

2. **Surface Integrals in 3D**: For surfaces defined as \(Z = G(X, Y)\), the differential area element \(\mathrm{d}S\) is expressed as \(\sqrt{\left( \frac{\partial Z}{\partial X}\right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial Z}{\partial Y}\right)^2 + 1} \, \mathrm{d}A\), allowing surface integrals to be transformed into double integrals over a plane.

3. **Coordinate Transformations**: For surfaces defined by equations like \(Y = G(X, Z)\) or \(X = G(Y, Z)\), simplifications occur (e.g., \(\partial Y/\partial Y = 1\)), facilitating integral computations.

4. **Stokes' Theorem Application**: This theorem unifies the concepts of multivariable calculus by linking a surface integral over a vector field to a line integral around its boundary in three-dimensional space, extending Green's theorem into higher dimensions.

The text emphasizes transforming and computing surface integrals in 3D through these methods, using normal vectors derived from gradients.
