The lecture is designed for two audiences interested in research: those from well-established systems with available funding ("First World") and those from regions with limited resources but abundant data ("Third World"). In both contexts, having a strong foundation in research principles is crucial. The main goal of research should be to identify an important question and explore existing literature before collecting original data. When collecting data, itâ€™s essential to choose relevant variables, ensure accuracy and reproducibility, consider ethical issues (especially with human subjects), maintain confidentiality, and then analyze the data. This series will focus on data analysis techniques, aiming to make the process enjoyable and informative for attendees.
