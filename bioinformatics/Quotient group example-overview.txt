The text provides an example of constructing a quotient group using integers under addition and the normal subgroup consisting of multiples of 3. The subgroup \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) includes numbers like \(-9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9,\) etc. The goal is to form the quotient group \(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\), where cosets are created by adding integers from the larger group to elements of the subgroup.

Three distinct cosets (equivalence classes) are identified: 
1. \(0 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots\}\)
2. \(1 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -8, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, \ldots\}\)
3. \(2 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -7, -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, \ldots\}\)

These cosets partition the group of integers into three distinct sets, forming the elements of the quotient group: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\).

The text further explains that this quotient group is indeed a valid group under addition modulo 3. The operation table shows closure, associativity, identity (element 0), and inverses within this set. Notably, since this group contains three elements, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, \(\mathbb{Z}_3\).

The example illustrates a fundamental aspect of quotient groups and their connection to homomorphisms and isomorphisms in abstract algebra, specifically highlighting that \(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\) corresponds to \(\mathbb{Z}_3\), the cyclic group with three elements.

The text provides an example of constructing a quotient group using integers under addition. The chosen normal subgroup \( G \) consists of all multiples of 3 (i.e., \( 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots\} \)). 

The goal is to form the quotient group \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). This involves creating cosets of the subgroup \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) within the integers. Since left and right cosets are equal (due to normality), only left cosets are considered. 

Three representative elements from the integers, 0, 1, and 2, form three distinct cosets:
- \( 0 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots\} \)
- \( 1 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -8, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, \ldots\} \)
- \( 2 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -7, -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, \ldots\} \)

These cosets partition the integers into equivalence classes. The set of these cosets forms a group under addition modulo 3: \( \{0 + 3\mathbb{Z}, 1 + 3\mathbb{Z}, 2 + 3\mathbb{Z}\} \). 

This quotient group has three elements, and since it contains a prime number of elements (3), it is isomorphic to the cyclic group \( C_3 \) with three elements. The operation table demonstrates closure, associativity, an identity element (0 mod 3), and inverses within this group structure, confirming that it satisfies all group axioms. This example illustrates how quotient groups operate and their relationship to known group structures like cyclic groups.
