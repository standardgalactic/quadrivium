The provided text covers several concepts related to radioactive decay and half-life, demonstrating calculations based on these principles:

1. **Thallium-208 Half-Life**: Thallium-208 has a half-life of 3.053 minutes. Initially having an activity of 2,400 disintegrations per second, its activity after 9 minutes is calculated by recognizing that this period is approximately 2.9 times the half-life. The remaining activity would be slightly more than one-eighth of the initial value due to it being just under three full half-lives.

2. **Indium-115 Half-Life**: Indium-115 has an extremely long half-life (4.4 × 10^14 years), surpassing the age of the universe. Despite its lengthy half-life, decay can still occur at any moment for individual nuclei due to the random nature of radioactive processes.

3. **Activity Variability in Samples**: Two samples of identical radioactive materials may exhibit different activities simultaneously because each atom decays independently and randomly.

4. **Free Neutron Decay**: A free neutron has a half-life of 10.4 minutes (624 seconds), decaying into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino via beta-negative decay. The text calculates this half-life in terms of seconds.

5. **Neutron Beam Travel Distance**: To determine how far neutrons travel before 25% have decayed (leaving 75%), the exponential decay formula is used:

   \[
   N = N_0 e^{-\lambda T}
   \]

   With \( N = 0.75N_0 \), we derive:

   \[
   0.75 = e^{-\lambda T}
   \]

   Taking the natural logarithm gives:

   \[
   \ln(0.75) = -\lambda T
   \]

   Using the half-life relationship \( \lambda = \frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}} \), and with a half-life of 624 seconds, \( \lambda \approx 1.11 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{s}^{-1} \). Solving for \( T \) gives approximately 259 seconds to reduce the quantity to 75% of its original amount.

6. **Kinetic Energy and Neutron Travel**: The text also outlines calculating a neutron's travel distance using kinetic energy:

   - The velocity is derived from the formula: 

     \[
     v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}}
     \]

   - With known mass and kinetic energy, velocity is calculated.
   
   - Distance (\( d \)) traveled by the neutron over time \( t \) is:

     \[
     d = v \times t
     \]

   This results in a distance of approximately 8.01 × 10^6 meters (or 8.01 megameters), with no issues arising from this calculation.

The text emphasizes understanding radioactive decay as probabilistic, using known half-lives to predict changes in activity over time and applying these principles to calculate specific outcomes like travel distances for neutrons based on their kinetic energy.
