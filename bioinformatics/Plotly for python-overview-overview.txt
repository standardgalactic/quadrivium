Jean Klopper is a surgeon and senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town, leading the Klopper Research Group focused on supporting postgraduate research in machine learning applications within clinical settings. He offers online courses in biostatistics on platforms like YouTube, Udemy, and Coursera. Jean prefers using the Plotly library for Python data visualization due to its flexibility across different programming languages and environments.

He plans to release a video series introducing Plotly, starting with bar charts, and encourages viewers to subscribe and enable notifications for updates. The text also mentions postgraduate research incorporating data visualization tools like Plotly but notes some unclear parts possibly due to transcription errors or language barriers. Jean stresses the importance of students actively engaging with these visualization tools in their learning process.
