The text explains how to calculate the electric field created by point charges, highlighting the principle of superposition. Here's a summary:

1. **Electric Field Due to a Point Charge**: The electric field \(E\) from a charge \(q\) at distance \(r\) is given by Coulomb's law: 
   \[
   E = \frac{k |q|}{r^2}
   \]
   where \(k\) is the electrostatic constant.

2. **Superposition Principle**: The net electric field from multiple charges at a point is the vector sum of the fields from each charge individually.

3. **Example Problem**: 
   - Four charges (\(+2q\), \(-4q\), and \(-2q\)) are placed equidistantly from the origin, angled at 30 degrees relative to an axis.
   - To find the net electric field at the origin:
     - Break down each charge's contribution into x and y components using trigonometric functions (cosine for x-direction, sine for y-direction).
     - Consider the direction of each component based on whether the charge is positive or negative.

4. **Result**: 
   - Symmetry in the configuration causes some components to cancel out.
   - The net electric field at the origin is calculated as \(6.93 \times k \times q / d^2\).

This discussion prepares for further exploration of more complex arrangements, such as electric dipoles.
