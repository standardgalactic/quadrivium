The provided text explores problems related to thin lenses in geometric optics, focusing on determining object positions and understanding image characteristics using mathematical principles.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Lens Formula**:
   - The relationship between the object distance (\(S_0\)), image distance (\(S_I\)), and focal length (\(F\)) is given by the lens formula: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_I} = \frac{1}{F}
     \]

2. **Magnification**:
   - Magnification (\(M\)) is defined as:
     \[
     M = -\frac{S_I}{S_0}
     \]
   - A negative magnification indicates an inverted image.

3. **Quadratic Equation for Object Placement**:
   - In the first scenario, a thin lens with a focal length of 9 cm requires solving a quadratic equation to find two possible object distances where the image appears on a screen 40 cm away: 
     \[
     S_0^2 - 40S_0 + 360 = 0
     \]
   - Solutions are \(S_0 = 26.3\) cm and \(13.7\) cm.

4. **Image Types**:
   - Real images occur when the object is beyond a certain distance from the lens, while virtual images form closer to the lens on the same side as the object.

5. **Lens Type Determination**:
   - The nature of the lens (converging or diverging) can be determined using the lens makerâ€™s formula:
     \[
     \frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2} \right)
     \]
   - Given \(n = 1.54\), \(r_1 = 20\) cm, and \(r_2 = 40\) cm:
     \[
     n - 1 = 0.54
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2} = \frac{1}{20} - \frac{1}{40} = \frac{1}{40}
     \]
   - Substituting these values gives:
     \[
     \frac{1}{f} = 0.54 \times \frac{1}{40} = 0.0135
     \]
   - Thus, \(f \approx 74.1\) cm, indicating a converging lens.

6. **Projection and Image Formation**:
   - Convex lenses can project real images onto screens if the object is beyond the focal point.
   - Concave lenses always produce virtual images.

### Summary:

The text provides an overview of solving optics problems using mathematical analysis to determine object placement relative to lenses, focusing on image formation and lens characteristics. It emphasizes understanding the relationships between optical variables and applying formulas to derive solutions for specific scenarios in geometric optics.
