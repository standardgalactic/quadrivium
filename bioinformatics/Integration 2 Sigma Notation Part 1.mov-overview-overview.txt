Sigma notation is a concise way to express the sum of elements in a sequence. It uses a variable, typically "k," that increments by one for each term, with specified starting and ending values. In Example 1, sigma notation represents the sum from \(k = 0\) to \(k = 3\), resulting in \(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\). Example 2 shows the sum of "k plus k squared" from \(k = 0\) to \(k = 2\), yielding the terms \(0 + 0^2 + 1 + 1^2 + 2 + 2^2 = 8\). Sigma notation simplifies expressing and calculating sums through a systematic approach.
