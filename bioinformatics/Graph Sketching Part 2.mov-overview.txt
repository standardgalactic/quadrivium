This text outlines a step-by-step approach to sketching the graph of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x+2} \). The process includes several key steps:

1. **Plot Discontinuities**: Identify and plot any discontinuities, particularly infinite ones. For this function, \( x \neq -2 \) because it makes the denominator zero, leading to a vertical asymptote at \( x = -2 \).

2. **Evaluate End Behavior**: Determine the behavior of the function as \( x \to -\infty \) and \( x \to +\infty \). As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \) approaches a value slightly over 1, and as \( x \to +\infty \), it approaches just under 1. Near \( x = -2 \), the function tends to positive infinity from the left and negative infinity from the right.

3. **Identify Intercepts**: Find where the graph intersects the axes. The x-intercept is at \( x = -1 \) (where \( f(x) = 0 \)), and the y-intercept is at \( y = \frac{1}{2} \) (where \( x = 0 \)).

4. **Determine Turning Points**: Calculate the first derivative, \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{(x+2)^2} \), which never equals zero, indicating no turning points. This means the graph does not change direction within its defined ranges.

5. **Evaluate Slope**: In both ranges (from \(-\infty\) to \(-2\) and from \(-2\) to \(+\infty\)), the slope is positive, indicating the graph slopes upwards in both intervals.

6. **Find Inflection Points**: Calculate the second derivative, \( f''(x) = -\frac{2}{(x+2)^3} \), which also never equals zero, indicating no inflection points. This means the concavity does not change within the ranges.

7. **Concavity**: The graph is concave up from \(-\infty\) to \(-2\) and concave down from \(-2\) to \(+\infty\).

The text emphasizes understanding the behavior of the function rather than producing a neat sketch, highlighting the importance of grasping concepts like discontinuities, end behavior, derivatives, and concavity. It also suggests creating a table of values for a more accurate graph. Understanding infinite values is crucial for successful graph sketching.

The text provides a detailed guide on sketching the graph of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{x + 2} \). Here's a summary:

1. **Discontinuities and Endpoints**: The function has a discontinuity at \( x = -2 \) because it makes the denominator zero, so this is represented by a vertical asymptote on the graph. The function splits into two ranges: from negative infinity to just before \(-2\) and from just after \(-2\) to positive infinity.

2. **Behavior Near Discontinuities**:
   - As \( x \) approaches \(-2\) from the left, \( f(x) \to +\infty \).
   - As \( x \) approaches \(-2\) from the right, \( f(x) \to -\infty \).

3. **End Behavior**: 
   - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \) tends to slightly over 1.
   - As \( x \to +\infty \), \( f(x) \) approaches just under 1.

4. **Intercepts**:
   - The x-intercept is at \( x = -1 \).
   - The y-intercept is at \( y = \frac{1}{2} \).

5. **Turning Points**: 
   - The first derivative, \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{(x + 2)^2} \), never equals zero; hence, there are no turning points.

6. **Slope and Concavity**:
   - In both ranges (left of \(-2\) and right of \(-2\)), the graph slopes upwards due to a positive first derivative.
   - The second derivative, \( f''(x) = \frac{-2}{(x + 2)^3} \), indicates no inflection points. 
     - For \( x < -2 \), the graph is concave up.
     - For \( x > -2 \), the graph is concave down.

7. **Graph Completion**: Understanding these features helps complete the graph, emphasizing comprehension of function behavior and derivatives rather than neatness in sketching.

The text underscores the importance of grasping infinite values and derivative concepts for effective graph sketching.
