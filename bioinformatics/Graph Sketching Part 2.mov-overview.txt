This text outlines a step-by-step approach to sketching the graph of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x+2} \). The process includes several key steps:

1. **Plot Discontinuities**: Identify and plot any discontinuities, particularly infinite ones. For this function, \( x \neq -2 \) because it makes the denominator zero, leading to a vertical asymptote at \( x = -2 \).

2. **Evaluate End Behavior**: Determine the behavior of the function as \( x \to -\infty \) and \( x \to +\infty \). As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \) approaches a value slightly over 1, and as \( x \to +\infty \), it approaches just under 1. Near \( x = -2 \), the function tends to positive infinity from the left and negative infinity from the right.

3. **Identify Intercepts**: Find where the graph intersects the axes. The x-intercept is at \( x = -1 \) (where \( f(x) = 0 \)), and the y-intercept is at \( y = \frac{1}{2} \) (where \( x = 0 \)).

4. **Determine Turning Points**: Calculate the first derivative, \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{(x+2)^2} \), which never equals zero, indicating no turning points. This means the graph does not change direction within its defined ranges.

5. **Evaluate Slope**: In both ranges (from \(-\infty\) to \(-2\) and from \(-2\) to \(+\infty\)), the slope is positive, indicating the graph slopes upwards in both intervals.

6. **Find Inflection Points**: Calculate the second derivative, \( f''(x) = -\frac{2}{(x+2)^3} \), which also never equals zero, indicating no inflection points. This means the concavity does not change within the ranges.

7. **Concavity**: The graph is concave up from \(-\infty\) to \(-2\) and concave down from \(-2\) to \(+\infty\).

The text emphasizes understanding the behavior of the function rather than producing a neat sketch, highlighting the importance of grasping concepts like discontinuities, end behavior, derivatives, and concavity. It also suggests creating a table of values for a more accurate graph. Understanding infinite values is crucial for successful graph sketching.
