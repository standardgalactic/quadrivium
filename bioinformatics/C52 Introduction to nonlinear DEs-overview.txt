The text discusses solving non-linear differential equations, which differ from linear ones as they involve powers other than one for the function and its derivatives. These equations typically lack explicit solutions, but some can be solved by reducing their order using substitution methods.

One approach involves introducing a new variable \( u(x) = \frac{dy}{dx} \), transforming the second derivative into \( \frac{du}{dx} \). This method allows for separation of variables and integration to find solutions. For example, in an equation like \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 2x + (\frac{dy}{dx})^2 \), substituting \( u \) simplifies the problem into a solvable form.

The text distinguishes between non-autonomous equations (involving the independent variable, \( x \)) and autonomous ones (not involving \( x \)). An example of an autonomous equation is \( y'' = (y')^2 \), which can be solved by separating variables after substituting \( u = y' \).

While some non-linear differential equations allow for explicit solutions through these techniques, many require approximations using Taylor polynomials. These approximations provide solutions valid within specific regions on the x-axis. The next section promises to explore such cases where Taylor series are necessary for approximation.
