The text discusses solving non-linear differential equations, which differ from linear ones as they involve powers other than one for the function and its derivatives. These equations typically lack explicit solutions, but some can be solved by reducing their order using substitution methods.

One approach involves introducing a new variable \( u(x) = \frac{dy}{dx} \), transforming the second derivative into \( \frac{du}{dx} \). This method allows for separation of variables and integration to find solutions. For example, in an equation like \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 2x + (\frac{dy}{dx})^2 \), substituting \( u \) simplifies the problem into a solvable form.

The text distinguishes between non-autonomous equations (involving the independent variable, \( x \)) and autonomous ones (not involving \( x \)). An example of an autonomous equation is \( y'' = (y')^2 \), which can be solved by separating variables after substituting \( u = y' \).

While some non-linear differential equations allow for explicit solutions through these techniques, many require approximations using Taylor polynomials. These approximations provide solutions valid within specific regions on the x-axis. The next section promises to explore such cases where Taylor series are necessary for approximation.

The text provides an overview of solving non-linear differential equations, highlighting that these types of equations typically do not allow for straightforward explicit solutions. However, certain non-linear equations can be solved by reducing their order through substitution.

1. **Reduction of Order**: A new function \( u(x) \) is introduced such that \( u = \frac{dy}{dx} \). This transforms the second derivative \( y'' \) into a first-order derivative with respect to \( u \), allowing for potential separation of variables and integration.

2. **Non-Autonomous vs. Autonomous Equations**:
   - A non-autonomous equation includes the independent variable (e.g., \( x \)), as shown in the example where \( y'' = 2x + (y')^2 \). By substituting \( u = \frac{dy}{dx} \), this equation becomes separable and solvable.
   - An autonomous equation does not include the independent variable, like \( y'' = (y')^2 \). Here, similar substitution leads to a solution involving logarithmic integration.

3. **Solving Specific Examples**:
   - For non-autonomous equations, solving involves integrating after separating variables and sometimes applying trigonometric identities or substitutions.
   - For autonomous equations, the process similarly involves separation of variables and integration, often resulting in expressions with natural logarithms or exponentials.

4. **General Solutions**: The solutions derived are explicit for specific cases but not generalizable to all non-linear differential equations. Many such equations require approximation methods like Taylor polynomials, which provide solutions valid only within certain regions around a point on the \( x \)-axis.

The text concludes by indicating that while some non-linear differential equations can be solved explicitly through these techniques, most necessitate approximations for practical solutions.
