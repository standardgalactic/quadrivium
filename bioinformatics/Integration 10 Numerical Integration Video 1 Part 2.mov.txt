The area of a trapezoid is base times the sum of the height of the two sides divided by 2.
Here the area under the curve has been divided again into equal bases with width delta x.
Trapezoids are created by connecting the y values.
The area of the first trapezoid is delta x times y0 plus y1 divided by 2 and so on.
Taking delta x over 2 out as a common factor results in the equation for trapezoidal sums,
which you will notice the same as the average of left and right Riemann sums.
In the next video I will look at sums and sums.
