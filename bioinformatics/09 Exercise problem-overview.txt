The text outlines a logical proof demonstrating the equality of two set expressions: \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \). This is done by showing that each side of the equation is a subset of the other. 

1. **Definitions Used**:
   - Intersection (\(\cap\)) is defined as the set containing all elements common to both sets.
   - Union (\(\cup\)) is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.

2. **Proof Strategy**:
   - The proof requires demonstrating both directions of subset relationships for equality: 
     1. \( A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \)
     2. \( (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \subseteq A \cap (B \cup C) \)

3. **First Direction**:
   - Assume an element \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).
   - This means \( X \in A \) and \( X \in B \cup C \), implying \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \).
   - Consequently, \( X \in (A \cap B) \) or \( X \in (A \cap C) \), leading to \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).

4. **Second Direction**:
   - Assume an element \( X \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - This means \( X \in A \cap B \) or \( X \in A \cap C \), implying \( X \in A \) and either \( X \in B \) or \( X \in C \).
   - Therefore, \( X \in A \) and \( X \in (B \cup C) \), leading to \( X \in A \cap (B \cup C) \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since both subset relationships are proven, the two sets are equal: \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \).
   - The proof is complete by demonstrating equality through mutual subset inclusion.

This logical structure confirms the distributive property of intersection over union in set theory.
