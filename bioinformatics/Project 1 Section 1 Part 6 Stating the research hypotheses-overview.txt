The text emphasizes the importance of establishing hypotheses before designing data collection tools or analyzing data in ethical research practices. It explains how researchers should formulate two main research questions and set corresponding null and alternative (or test) hypotheses for comparing HbA1c levels at admission between patients with minor and major infections.

- **Null Hypothesis**: There is no difference between the HbA1c levels of the two patient groups.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a difference between the HbA1c levels of the two groups, without specifying which group might have higher or lower levels. This constitutes a two-tailed test.

The text warns against changing hypotheses after data analysis to fit desired outcomes (e.g., switching from a two-tailed to a one-tailed test post hoc), as this is unethical.

For comparing CRP levels at admission between the same patient groups, similar hypotheses are set without prior judgment on which group might have higher or lower values. This also represents a two-tailed test.

The text highlights the importance of pre-defining an alpha level (e.g., 0.05) to determine statistical significance. A p-value below this threshold would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, while a value above it means failing to reject the null hypothesis. It stresses that researchers can only fail to reject the null; they cannot prove it.

Finally, the text alludes to discussing research protocols and ethics next, reinforcing the significance of ethical considerations in research design and execution.

The text emphasizes the importance of establishing hypotheses before designing data collection tools or analyzing any data in ethical research practices. It outlines two main research questions: comparing HbA1c admission levels between patients with minor and major infections, and comparing CRP admission levels between these patient groups.

For both questions, a null hypothesis is set stating no difference between the groups, while an alternate (or test) hypothesis suggests there will be a difference. It's crucial that hypotheses are established before data collection or analysis to avoid ethical issues such as p-hacking, which involves changing hypotheses post hoc based on observed data results.

The text explains that when setting hypotheses for differences without specifying direction (e.g., one group having higher levels than the other), a two-tailed test is appropriate. A one-tailed test should only be used if there is strong justification beforehand, such as compelling evidence in existing literature suggesting a directional difference.

For both research questions, null and alternate hypotheses are defined with no initial assumptions about directionality, making these two-tailed tests. The significance level (alpha) is set at 0.05, meaning results yielding p-values less than this threshold will be considered statistically significant, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate hypothesis.

The text underscores that researchers should never change hypotheses after data analysis and should default to two-tailed tests unless there's a strong rationale for using one-tailed tests. It concludes by mentioning an upcoming discussion on protocols and ethics.
