To find the indefinite integral of \(\sec^4(x) \, dx\), follow these steps:

1. **Rewrite Using Trigonometric Identity**: Start by using the identity \(\sec^2(x) = 1 + \tan^2(x)\). Rewrite the integrand as \((1 + \tan^2(x)) \cdot \sec^2(x)\).

2. **Substitution**: Use the substitution \(u = \tan(x)\), which gives \(du = \sec^2(x) \, dx\). This transforms the integral into \(\int (1 + u^2) \, du\).

3. **Integrate**: Break down the integral into two simpler integrals: \(\int 1 \, du\) and \(\int u^2 \, du\).
   - The first integral evaluates to \(u\).
   - The second integral evaluates to \(\frac{u^3}{3}\).

4. **Combine Results**: Combine the results to get \(u + \frac{u^3}{3} + C\), where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

5. **Back-Substitute**: Replace \(u\) with \(\tan(x)\) to obtain the final result: \(\tan(x) + \frac{\tan^3(x)}{3} + C\).

This method uses trigonometric substitution and basic integration techniques to solve the integral.
