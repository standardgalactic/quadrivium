The text describes a mathematical process involving solving differential equations using the Laplace transform. The speaker is working on an expression for \( X_1(S) \), which involves manipulating a fraction into partial fractions to facilitate finding its inverse Laplace transform.

Initially, they encounter difficulty in breaking down the equation due to the form of the denominators. They use complex numbers to simplify the process and solve for constants \( A \) and \( B \). Once these are determined, they rewrite \( X_1(S) \) using these values.

The next step involves taking the inverse Laplace transform to find \( x_1(t) \). This requires converting terms into recognizable forms that match standard Laplace pairs, specifically involving sine functions. The speaker multiplies by constants to simplify expressions and ensure neatness in mathematical presentation.

After some verification and correction of calculations, they confirm the solution for \( x_1(t) \). The process is detailed and time-consuming, with a mention of pausing the explanation to address another part of the problem, likely finding \( x_2(t) \).

The text outlines a mathematical process involving Laplace transforms and partial fraction decomposition to solve for \( X_1(t) \). Here's a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: The goal is to solve for \( X_1(s) \) using Laplace transforms, converting differential equations into algebraic ones.

2. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**: 
   - The expression involves terms like \( S^2 / (S^4 + 14S^2 - 24) \).
   - This requires partial fraction decomposition, which is not straightforward due to the form of the denominators.
   
3. **Complex Numbers**:
   - Complex numbers are introduced to simplify solving for coefficients in the partial fractions.
   - The equation \( Z = S^2 / (S^4 + 14S^2 - 24) \) is manipulated by setting \( Z = A/(S^2 + aS + b) + B/(S^2 + cS + d) \).

4. **Solving for Coefficients**:
   - By substituting specific values of \( S \), the coefficients \( A \) and \( B \) are determined.
   - This involves algebraic manipulation and solving linear equations.

5. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:
   - Once the partial fractions are decomposed, the inverse Laplace transform is applied to find \( X_1(t) \).
   - The solution involves sine functions with specific coefficients derived from the decomposition.

6. **Verification**:
   - The author double-checks calculations to ensure accuracy.
   - Corrections are made where necessary to confirm the final expression for \( X_1(t) \).

7. **Next Steps**:
   - The process will continue to solve for \( X_2(t) \), indicating a sequence of problems or equations being tackled.

The text reflects a detailed step-by-step approach to solving differential equations using Laplace transforms, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and verification in mathematical problem-solving.
