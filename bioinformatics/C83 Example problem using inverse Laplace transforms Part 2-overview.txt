The text describes a mathematical process involving solving differential equations using the Laplace transform. The speaker is working on an expression for \( X_1(S) \), which involves manipulating a fraction into partial fractions to facilitate finding its inverse Laplace transform.

Initially, they encounter difficulty in breaking down the equation due to the form of the denominators. They use complex numbers to simplify the process and solve for constants \( A \) and \( B \). Once these are determined, they rewrite \( X_1(S) \) using these values.

The next step involves taking the inverse Laplace transform to find \( x_1(t) \). This requires converting terms into recognizable forms that match standard Laplace pairs, specifically involving sine functions. The speaker multiplies by constants to simplify expressions and ensure neatness in mathematical presentation.

After some verification and correction of calculations, they confirm the solution for \( x_1(t) \). The process is detailed and time-consuming, with a mention of pausing the explanation to address another part of the problem, likely finding \( x_2(t) \).
