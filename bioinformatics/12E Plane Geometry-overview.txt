Hereâ€™s a summary of the text with an explanation of how to express equations of planes in point-normal form:

### Point-Normal Form Overview:
- **Definition**: Point-normal form involves expressing the equation of a plane using a normal vector and a specific point on that plane. The dot product of the normal vector and any vector lying on the plane equals zero because they are perpendicular.

### Example 1: 
- **Given Vector (Normal)**: \( \mathbf{N} = (-2, 1, -1) \)
- **Point on Plane**: \( P_0 = (X_0, Y_0, Z_0) \)
- **Vector in Plane**: \( \mathbf{P_0P} = (X - X_0, Y - Y_0, Z - Z_0) \)
- **Equation**: \( (-2)(X - X_0) + 1(Y - Y_0) - 1(Z - Z_0) = 0 \)

### Example 2: 
- **Plane Equation**: \( 3X + 7Y + 2Z = 10 \)
- **Normal Vector**: \( \mathbf{N} = (-3, 7, 2) \)
- **Point on Plane**: Find a point by setting \( X = 0 \), \( Y = 0 \) leading to \( Z = 5 \). Thus, \( P_0 = (0, 0, 5) \).
- **Vector in Plane**: \( \mathbf{P_0P} = (X - 0, Y - 0, Z - 5) \)
- **Equation**: \( (-3)(X - 0) + 7(Y - 0) + 2(Z - 5) = 0 \)

### Example 3:
- **Plane Equation**: \( X - 4Z = 0 \), which implies \( Y = 0 \)
- **Normal Vector**: \( \mathbf{N} = (1, 0, -4) \)
- **Point on Plane**: Choose any point satisfying the equation, e.g., \( P_0 = (0, 0, 0) \).
- **Vector in Plane**: \( \mathbf{P_0P} = (X - 0, Y - 0, Z - 0) \)
- **Equation**: \( 1(X - 0) + 0(Y - 0) - 4(Z - 0) = 0 \)

### Key Points:
- The point-normal form is derived by using a normal vector and a specific point on the plane.
- Different points can be chosen to derive different, but equivalent, point-normal forms for the same plane.

The text outlines a process for analyzing geometric properties of planes in three-dimensional space, focusing on finding specific points and determining the relationship between two planes.

1. **Point Construction**: The discussion begins with constructing a point where \( X = 0 \), \( Y = 0 \), resulting in \( Z = 0 \). This leads to identifying the point (0, 0, 0) as lying on a plane where \( Y \) is always zero.

2. **Vector and Point Normal Form**: A vector from this point \( P_0(0, 0, 0) \) to any general point \( P(X, Y, Z) \) in the space is described by \( (X - 0, Y - 0, Z - 0) \). The dot product of a normal vector \( N \) with this vector results in an equation: \( X + 0 \cdot Y - 4Z = 0 \), representing the point-normal form of the plane.

3. **Parallel Planes**: To determine if two planes are parallel, their normal vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. The text provides two planes with equations:
   - Plane 1: \( 4X - Y + 2Z = 8 \) (normal vector: \( (4, -1, 2) \))
   - Plane 2: \( 8X - 2Y + 6Z = 10 \) (normal vector: \( (8, -2, 6) \))

   By comparing the normal vectors, it is evident that the second plane's normal vector is a scalar multiple of the first (\( (8, -2, 6) = 2 \times (4, -1, 2) \)), confirming the planes are parallel.

The text describes a process for determining whether two planes are parallel by comparing their normal vectors. It begins with a series of simple arithmetic calculations, then transitions into analyzing plane equations.

Two equations representing planes are given:  
1. \(8X - 2Y - 4Z + 5 = 0\)  
2. \(X - \frac{1}{4}Y - \frac{1}{2}Z = 0\)

The normal vector for the first plane is derived as \((8, -2, -4)\). For the second plane, multiplying the entire equation by 8 transforms it to match the form of the first plane: \(8X - 2Y - 4Z = 0\), revealing that its normal vector is a scalar multiple of the first plane's normal vector.

The text concludes that since the normal vectors are proportional (\(N1 = 8 \times N2\)), the planes are parallel. However, there is an additional constant term (+5) in the first equation indicating they are not coincident but merely parallel at different positions along their respective axes.

The text indicates that the two planes in question are parallel. This means they run alongside each other at a constant distance and will never intersect, regardless of how far they extend.
