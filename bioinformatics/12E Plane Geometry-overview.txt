Hereâ€™s a summary of the text with an explanation of how to express equations of planes in point-normal form:

### Point-Normal Form Overview:
- **Definition**: Point-normal form involves expressing the equation of a plane using a normal vector and a specific point on that plane. The dot product of the normal vector and any vector lying on the plane equals zero because they are perpendicular.

### Example 1: 
- **Given Vector (Normal)**: \( \mathbf{N} = (-2, 1, -1) \)
- **Point on Plane**: \( P_0 = (X_0, Y_0, Z_0) \)
- **Vector in Plane**: \( \mathbf{P_0P} = (X - X_0, Y - Y_0, Z - Z_0) \)
- **Equation**: \( (-2)(X - X_0) + 1(Y - Y_0) - 1(Z - Z_0) = 0 \)

### Example 2: 
- **Plane Equation**: \( 3X + 7Y + 2Z = 10 \)
- **Normal Vector**: \( \mathbf{N} = (-3, 7, 2) \)
- **Point on Plane**: Find a point by setting \( X = 0 \), \( Y = 0 \) leading to \( Z = 5 \). Thus, \( P_0 = (0, 0, 5) \).
- **Vector in Plane**: \( \mathbf{P_0P} = (X - 0, Y - 0, Z - 5) \)
- **Equation**: \( (-3)(X - 0) + 7(Y - 0) + 2(Z - 5) = 0 \)

### Example 3:
- **Plane Equation**: \( X - 4Z = 0 \), which implies \( Y = 0 \)
- **Normal Vector**: \( \mathbf{N} = (1, 0, -4) \)
- **Point on Plane**: Choose any point satisfying the equation, e.g., \( P_0 = (0, 0, 0) \).
- **Vector in Plane**: \( \mathbf{P_0P} = (X - 0, Y - 0, Z - 0) \)
- **Equation**: \( 1(X - 0) + 0(Y - 0) - 4(Z - 0) = 0 \)

### Key Points:
- The point-normal form is derived by using a normal vector and a specific point on the plane.
- Different points can be chosen to derive different, but equivalent, point-normal forms for the same plane.

The text outlines a process for analyzing geometric properties of planes in three-dimensional space, focusing on finding specific points and determining the relationship between two planes.

1. **Point Construction**: The discussion begins with constructing a point where \( X = 0 \), \( Y = 0 \), resulting in \( Z = 0 \). This leads to identifying the point (0, 0, 0) as lying on a plane where \( Y \) is always zero.

2. **Vector and Point Normal Form**: A vector from this point \( P_0(0, 0, 0) \) to any general point \( P(X, Y, Z) \) in the space is described by \( (X - 0, Y - 0, Z - 0) \). The dot product of a normal vector \( N \) with this vector results in an equation: \( X + 0 \cdot Y - 4Z = 0 \), representing the point-normal form of the plane.

3. **Parallel Planes**: To determine if two planes are parallel, their normal vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. The text provides two planes with equations:
   - Plane 1: \( 4X - Y + 2Z = 8 \) (normal vector: \( (4, -1, 2) \))
   - Plane 2: \( 8X - 2Y + 6Z = 10 \) (normal vector: \( (8, -2, 6) \))

   By comparing the normal vectors, it is evident that the second plane's normal vector is a scalar multiple of the first (\( (8, -2, 6) = 2 \times (4, -1, 2) \)), confirming the planes are parallel.

The text describes a process for determining whether two planes are parallel by comparing their normal vectors. It begins with a series of simple arithmetic calculations, then transitions into analyzing plane equations.

Two equations representing planes are given:  
1. \(8X - 2Y - 4Z + 5 = 0\)  
2. \(X - \frac{1}{4}Y - \frac{1}{2}Z = 0\)

The normal vector for the first plane is derived as \((8, -2, -4)\). For the second plane, multiplying the entire equation by 8 transforms it to match the form of the first plane: \(8X - 2Y - 4Z = 0\), revealing that its normal vector is a scalar multiple of the first plane's normal vector.

The text concludes that since the normal vectors are proportional (\(N1 = 8 \times N2\)), the planes are parallel. However, there is an additional constant term (+5) in the first equation indicating they are not coincident but merely parallel at different positions along their respective axes.

The text indicates that the two planes in question are parallel. This means they run alongside each other at a constant distance and will never intersect, regardless of how far they extend.

Here's a summary of the provided text:

1. **Point Normal Form Overview:**
   - Point normal form involves using a normal vector and a point on the plane.
   - The dot product between the normal vector (perpendicular to the plane) and any vector lying in the plane equals zero.

2. **Example with Vector \( \mathbf{ABC} \):**
   - Given a point \( P_0(X_0, Y_0, Z_0) \) on the plane and a normal vector \( \mathbf{N}(A, B, C) \).
   - The vector \( \mathbf{P_0P} = (X - X_0, Y - Y_0, Z - Z_0) \) is formed by another point \( P(X, Y, Z) \) on the plane.
   - Point normal form equation: \( A(X - X_0) + B(Y - Y_0) + C(Z - Z_0) = 0 \).

3. **Converting Plane Equation to Point Normal Form:**
   - Consider a plane with equation involving powers of \( X, Y, Z \).
   - Identify the normal vector from coefficients.
   - Find a point on the plane (e.g., where it intersects an axis like the Z-axis).
   - Use this point and normal vector to write the point normal form.

4. **Example Plane Equation:**
   - Given plane equation \( -3X + 7Y + 2Z = 10 \):
     - Normal vector is \( (-3, 7, 2) \).
     - Find a point on the plane (e.g., set \( X = 0, Y = 0 \), solve for \( Z \)).
     - Point found: \( P_0(0, 0, 5) \).
     - Write point normal form using this point and normal vector.

5. **Different Points Yield Different Forms:**
   - Any point on the plane can be used to derive a valid point normal form.
   - The choice of point affects the specific equation but not its validity.

6. **Another Plane Example:**
   - Given \( X - 4Z = 0 \) (where \( Y = 0 \)):
     - Normal vector is \( (1, 0, -4) \).
     - This plane is flat along the Y-axis.

This text explains how to derive and understand the point normal form of a plane equation using vectors and specific points on the plane.

The text describes a process of finding the point-normal form of a plane equation and determining whether two planes are parallel.

1. **Point-Normal Form Derivation:**
   - The text outlines constructing a plane where \(X = 0\) and \(Y = 0\), resulting in \(Z = 0\). This gives the point \((0, 0, 0)\).
   - It then constructs a vector from this point to another point \(P(X, Y, Z)\) as \(\langle X, Y, Z \rangle\).
   - The dot product of this vector with a normal vector \(N\) results in the equation \(X + 0 \times Y - 4Z = 0\), which is the point-normal form.

2. **Parallel Planes Determination:**
   - Two planes are given: \(4X - Y + 2Z = 8\) and \(8X - 2Y + 6Z = 10\).
   - Their normal vectors are \(\langle 4, -1, 2 \rangle\) and \(\langle 8, -2, 6 \rangle\), respectively.
   - To determine if the planes are parallel, it checks if one normal vector is a scalar multiple of the other. Here, \(\langle 8, -2, 6 \rangle = 2 \times \langle 4, -1, 2 \rangle\), indicating the planes are indeed parallel.

In summary, the text explains how to derive the point-normal form of a plane and checks for parallelism between two planes by comparing their normal vectors.

The text explains a process for determining if two planes are parallel by examining their normal vectors. The equations of the planes are given as:

1. \(8X - 2Y - 4Z + 5 = 0\)
2. \(X - \frac{1}{4}Y - \frac{1}{2}Z = 0\)

The normal vector for the first equation is \((8, -2, -4)\). For the second equation, after multiplying through by 8 to match the coefficients of the first plane's terms, the normal vector becomes \((8, -2, -4)\).

Since the normal vectors are scalar multiples of each other (specifically, \(N1 = 8 \times N2\)), it is concluded that the planes are indeed parallel.

The text states that the two planes are indeed parallel to each other. This means they run alongside one another without intersecting, maintaining a consistent distance apart.
