Let's do a few problems.
In one of those sessions where we just do a few quick easy ones. We have high power lasers.
They are used to compress a gas of charged particles
by radiation pressure. So if the laser generates
peak power at 1.5 times
10 to the power of 9 watts, if that's focused on
one square millimeter of this plasma,
find the pressure exerted on the plasma if the plasma
reflects all the light beams directly back along
the paths. So we have pressure.
Pressure equals what is
1.5 times 10 to the power of 9 watts. The area over
which that is done is 1.0
square millimeters. And to go to
SI units which we need here, we're going to multiply that by
1 square meter is
1,000 square millimeters
square. And that is just going to
give us, I think the outcome is
1.0 times 10 to the power
of negative 6 square meters.
So we want to know just the pressure.
If it totally, totally, totally
reflects, totally reflects.
So that's going to be
2I divided by C.
2I divided by C.
We don't know what I is
but remember that
I is, but remember that
I equals power divided by
area.
This is going to get a power
divided by area.
Plus we're going to get that the pressure
is going to be 2 times the pressure
divided by the area times C.
and I get for that about
10 megapascals.
Okay, so that was the easy one to do.
Let's have a look quickly at
another one.
So we have a totally absorbing
piece of paper and it has an area
of 2 cubic centimeters.
2 cubic, 2 square centimeters
and 2 square centimeters is
2.0 times 10 to the power
negative 4 square meters.
It's black, it totally absorbs
I think and the intensity
of the light falling on it
is 10 watts per square meter.
10 watts per square meter.
So intensity falls on that
piece of blackboard.
And we just want to know
if it totally absorbs, what is the
pressure if it totally absorbs?
Okay, the pressure if it totally
absorbs, remember it's just
I over C.
And it's just going to be
I over C.
So it's just I divided,
10 divided by 300
million meters per second.
And I get an answer for that
of 3.3 times 10 to the power
negative A.
So don't get confused
to me.
We're not interested in the area.
Remember if area changes,
the pressure doesn't change.
It only does so for the force.
It's already per unit area.
It's already per unit area.
So the best case is going to be
the intensity divided by C.
And because it's absorptive,
there's not a 2 there.
Let's do one more quick one.
Let's have a look.
answer that friend, we can carry on
in the next video.
Let's carry on with these quick
problems.
We want to know what is the radiation
pressure on a totally
absorptive surface.
So it's absorptive.
And we are a distance
1.5 meters away from say
a 500 watt
power source.
This is a
point source isotopic radiation
of an electromagnetic wave.
At 500 power 1.5 meter
what is the pressure?
We know the pressure absorptive here
for us.
Is this going to be
intensity divided
by C?
It has nothing to do
with the area here.
But we don't know intensity.
So we certainly have to
look at what intensity is.
And for us, remember that's
power. I shouldn't put it like that.
It looks like lower case. It's upper case.
Power divided by the area.
And the area is going to be
4 pi r squared
and as much as 1.5 meters
away we have this
we have the surface.
In other words, P A is going to be
equal for us
P divided by 4 pi r squared C.
4 pi r squared C.
Let me see if I've done this one.
I get about 5.9 times 10 to the power
of the 3 Pascals.
Ok, we can continue.
Here's a very interesting problem.
I just want to read it to you.
We say that a
plain electromagnetic wave with a
wavelength of 3 meters
which we do have there,
travels in a vacuum in a positive x
direction.
The electric field of a magnitude
300 volts per meter oscillates
parallel to the y axis.
So in the positive x direction
we have this velocity of this
electromagnetic wave and in the positive y direction
is this amplitude of hours.
And the amplitude of the maximum electric field
is 300 volts per meter.
Now we're going to ask quite a few questions.
The first question I think we want to know
what is the frequency of this wave
and the frequency is just going to be
C divided by lambda.
And as much as the speed of an
electromagnetic wave and the vacuum
equals frequency times wavelength.
And we're going to get C divided by 3
and the answer for that
that I get is about
1.0 times 10 to the power 8 hertz.
Next thing we want to know is
what is the angular frequency?
Remember angular frequency
is 2 pi times the frequency
and in our instance
it's 2 pi and frequency is C
over lambda. As I said I don't like to
use previous results when I
do these things. I want to get
anything that I do have
what was given in case I made
a little mistake on my calculator there.
And for angular frequency
I think I got a result of
6.3 times 10 to the power 8.
8 radians per second.
The next question is
what is the angular wave number?
Remember that this is 2 pi over lambda.
2 pi divided by lambda.
I do have lambda 2 pi divided by 3 is 2 thirds pi.
And if you convert that it's about
2.1 inverse meters.
The next question is
what is the amplitude of the magnetic field?
the magnetic field?
Remember that C equals
EM divided by BM.
So BM equals EM divided by C.
And for that I get about
1.0 times 10 to the power negative 6 tesla.
And now we want to know
parallel to what axis?
Parallel to what axis is the magnetic field?
Well, if the electric field is in that direction
and the resulting velocity of the wave is in that direction
there's nothing but for the magnetic wave
or its amplitude to be in this parallel to this z-axis.
If this is the y-axis and this is the x-axis
then certainly this is the z-axis
it's going to go in and out of the board.
Okay, so we know what axis is.
Now we want to know what is
and I want to read this part of the question
because it's not clearly stated that it's I
but listen to it.
Let me just find it.
What is the time averaged
rate of energy flow
in watts per square meter associated with this wave?
Associated with this wave.
So the time averaged rate of
intensity of watt per square meter.
I think we can say
if we remember
previously I equals E
squared divided by
divided by
it was C mu zero.
C mu zero.
Now we need to know
what E is. We know that E
equals Em
times the sine of
x minus T.
And if I square this, I square this,
and I square this.
And we know that the average
and that's why they call it that.
Now they say the
what is the time averaged rate of energy flow
in watts per
in watts per square meter.
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
In watts per square meter.
Now we know that the average of the sine squared
of any angle is a half.
So E squared is going to be
a half times Em squared.
So if I put that in there,
Em squared divided by 2C mu zero.
I was given Em.
2 is 2, C is C,
and we know what mu zero is.
So the answer that I get there
is about 120 watts per square meter.
Watts per square meter.
So that's energy flow
in as much as watts per joules per second
per square meter.
The next part of the question,
final, getting towards the end of the question.
Em, the wave uniformly illuminates a surface
of area 2 square meters.
If that surface is totally absorbed,
it totally absorbs the wave,
what is the rate at which the momentum
transferred to that surface?
If the surface totally absorbs
the wave, what are the rate at which momentum
is transferred to the surface,
and the radiation pressure on the surface.
So the first one they want to know
is the, let me read that again.
They want the rate at which momentum
is transferred.
So the rate at which momentum is transferred
is delta P over delta T.
The rate of transfer of momentum.
Momentum per second.
And we know what that is.
That is F.
That is force.
That is the equation for,
an expression for the equation for force.
And force here for totally absorptive,
for totally absorptive,
is this going to be I A divided by C.
I, I can just plug in, plug in these again.
As I said, I didn't like to use that 120
in case I made a mistake,
so I can plug all of that in.
That equals 2 meters per second.
And I divide that by C.
And I get an answer there,
I think about 8.0.
8.0 times 10 to the power of negative 7 Newton.
Negative 7 Newton.
And then lastly, I forgot again,
was the radiation pressure on that surface.
So pressure, if it's totally absorptive,
as far as it's going to just be,
it's just going to be I divided by C.
I, once again, I can plug all of those things in.
I'm just dividing by C.
And I get for that about 4.
What did I get?
Is that a 7,
4.0 times 10 to the power of negative 7 Pa.
Let's check on my arithmetic.
I didn't make a mistake on my calculator.
So that's a long problem,
but quite a nice problem,
running us through all the equations
that we do know up until now.
This might be the only tricky one.
Inasmuch as they want the rate of energy change.
So it's joules per second,
which is what per square meter.
So time average to rate,
that means we can use the half
as far as sine squared is concerned.
