Up until now you have evaluated integrals on an interval from a to b by finding a function
uppercase f , which is an antiderivative of the given function lowercase f , and
evaluating the difference between uppercase f and uppercase f .
Some functions though have no elementary formulas for their antiderivatives, such as the sine
of x squared or 1 over the natural log . At other times there may be no equations, such
as when an experiment results in the plotting of two values.
In these cases the area under the curve can be estimated by numerical integration.
The first method is already known to you, called Riemann sums.
The second is trapezoidal sums, and the last is Simpson sums.
I will review Riemann sums first.
Here is a function represented by a curve on an interval from a to b.
On the left the area under the curve on this interval is estimated by left Riemann sums,
and on the right by right Riemann sums.
This area is divided into smaller rectangles, each with an equal base of delta x, calculated
by dividing b-a by the number of rectangles n.
For left Riemann sums, the height of the first rectangle is taken at x0.
This is calculated as the f , also called y0.
The height of the second rectangle is calculated at x1, called y1.
The height of the last rectangle is calculated at xn-1, called y .
Note how this differs from right Riemann sums, where the height of the first rectangle is
taken as the f , and the height of the last rectangle is taken as the f .
The sum of the areas of all these rectangles approximates the area under the curve on the
interval given.
As the number of rectangles is taken to infinity, meaning delta x goes to zero, the limit gives
the precise area under the curve.
Note what happens if the average of these two areas are taken.
You will note that this is exactly the equation of the trapezoid sums, that I will discuss in
the next video.
