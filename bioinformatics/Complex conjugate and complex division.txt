so welcome back another lecture we've done arithmetic simple arithmetic on the complex
numbers one thing we didn't do though is we left out division how do we do division before we get
to division though we have to talk about something else and that's called the complex conjugate so
let's write that out complex a complex conjugate nice word conjugate complex conjugate of a of a
complex number so i'm going to have a any old complex number i'm going to say a plus b i and i
know now i'm not going to write it every time a and b are real numbers is the real part b is an
imaginary part of this complex number and i want to write the complex conjugate and i'm going to
define that let's try and stick to green again if i don't use green put it in the comments
definition that is going to be the following i'm going to say z and i'm going to put a little bar
on top and that defines the complex conjugate at least symbolizes it that's the symbol that we're
going to use z with a little bar on top and what we're going to say that equals a plus b but i'm
going to multiply b by negative one so let's put that out very specifically i'm going to say negative
one times bi and what you'll see in most lectures in the textbook it just means you're flipping the
sign but i don't like to say flipping the sign you know let's be you know but a bit more precise than
that yes we flip the sign but it is multiplying the imaginary part im of z you multiply that by negative
one so let's have a look at something like z equals let's have z equals three plus four i and so the
complex conjugate of that z with its little hat on top that is going to be three and there's positive
four times negative one which leaves me with negative four i okay and that's why we say the
sign would flip because if i have another one let's have that as negative three minus four i well z bar
or the complex conjugate is going to be negative three i don't do anything to the real part
multiply negative four by one or flip the sign if you wanted to that becomes positive four i
okay it's very simple this idea of a complex conjugate great stuff now that we know the complex conjugate
let's start talking about division of two complex numbers so i want to talk to you about division
division that's going to be the final part of our you know simple arithmetic now let's have a look at
what's going on we're going to have z sub one z sub one and we're going to divide that by z sub two
and i still want to you know make these two two arbitrary numbers so let's make z sub one it's a sub one b
sub one and i'm going to have z sub two that is going to be a sub two plus b sub two i okay a sub one
a sub two b sub one b sub two they are just real numbers and so i want to define this now that's not
so easy to do you can't do long division or anything like that and we're going to do a very specific thing
i'm going to say that that equals i'm going to have z sub one divided by z sub two as before
but now i'm going to multiply that by one anything that i multiply by one one is just a real number
it's actually also just a complex number because the imaginary part is the zero so i'm going to
multiply by one it is a field so we do have this multiplicative identity but that we just mean
you multiply by one nothing changes but i want to rewrite one in a specific way i'm going to look
at this denominator and i'm going to take its complex conjugate z sub two its complex conjugate
and in the numerator i'm also going to put that complex conjugate of this denominator so it's the
complex conjugate of z sub two divided by the complex conjugate of z sub two now you've just
got to go with me on this one that if you take a complex number and you divide it by itself this
is going to be the same as taking a real number dividing by itself unless it's zero you cannot divide
by zero so we have to kind of say here look let's just be clear let's be clear over here
that z sub two z sub two is not equal to zero plus zero i still cannot divide by zero okay so that's
what we're going to do and you're going to see something very special happen when you take a
complex number and you multiply by its complex conjugate let's have a look at what's going to
happen here so in the numerator let's go stick with green because this is still going to be our
definition so z sub one remember that was a sub one plus b sub one plus b sub one i and now i'm going
to multiply that by now i've just got to do the complex conjugate of z sub two so that's going to
be a sub two minus b sub two i and i'm going to divide that by z sub two times its complex conjugate so
that's going to be a sub two plus b sub two i and i'm going to have a sub two minus one times b sub two
leaves me with minus b sub two i great now did that help me in any way yes it did you'll see in a moment
so in the numerator we've seen how to multiply two complex numbers that's not a problem for us a sub one
times a sub two a sub one times a sub two now i'm going to just do that all in one go i'm going to
keep the real parts and the imaginary parts together and i know the other real part is going to come from
this final multiplication because i have b sub one times negative b sub two which leaves me with
negative b sub one b sub two but i have i times i i squared which is negative one the negative times
that negative leaves me with a positive i'm going to have positive b sub one b sub two great and now
i've got to do this outside but let's start with this one though and then i'll do that so that's going
to be plus a sub two a sub two b sub one b sub one i have those two if i multiply these two there's going
to be a negative there so that's a sub one b sub two a sub one b sub two and i've left out my i there
as a common factor so i went to but you know did a lot of stuff there in one step please you know the
first time you do it do it the long way and you see that there's no mistakes but there's my real part
that's my imaginary part now look what happens there's something very magic going to happen in the
denominator i still have a sub two times a sub two that leaves me with a sub two squared okay let's
do this final bit i'm going to have b sub two times b sub two i've got a minus there so it's minus b
sub two squared but i times i is negative one times that negative leaves me with a positive so that's
going to be positive b sub two squared that looks great because what i'm doing here just go with me
for a moment i have the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared so i'm still looking at
the z sub two i take the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared what about the rest though
when you're just going to see it's going to cancel out because look at this a sub two times b sub two i
with a negative so that's going to be negative a sub two b sub two i and there i have a positive
plus a sub two b sub two i so i've got minus a sub two b sub two i plus a sub two b sub two i
and that's just zero i mean they just cancel each other out i've got something minus itself it's gone
and look what's left in the denominator a real number and now we've learned something very special
if you take any complex number and you multiply by its complex conjugate you're going to be left with
a real number that's very nice and now it's very easy to write because i have a i can think of this
these two terms as one single term so i can divide this into the real part and this is going to be my
real part and i can take this divide it by this and that's going to be my imaginary part and i have i
left over so shall we do a little example why don't we just do that let's come up with let's come up
with two numbers let's have the following so we are going to do z sub one there's z sub one three
plus four i let's make z sub two let's make that one plus i so i want to do z sub one divided by z sub
two can i do that very easily let's do z sub one divided by z sub two i'm going to multiply that by z sub
two complex conjugate divided by z sub two complex conjugate so the denominator i'm taking its complex
conjugate conjugate and you can uh you know write these out so z sub one is going to be three plus
four i three plus four i and i'm going to multiply that by z sub two complex conjugate let's write that
down z sub two complex conjugate is going to be one minus i there's a coefficient of one there the
imaginary part is one multiplying by negative one the sign just flips as simple as that so i want to
multiply that by one minus i one minus i and then the denominator i'm going to have one plus i
and one minus i okay but z sub two times its complex conjugate and you can see already those things you
know they're going to they're going to cancel each other out because i'm going to have negative i
positive i the i's disappear and then the denominator in fact i'm just going to be left with one squared
plus one squared the real part squared of z sub two plus the imaginary part squared that's all i'm
going to have i'm going to have two in the denominator let's do the numerator three times one is three
three times negative i is minus three i four times four i times one is positive four i and now i have a
positive four times a negative one which leaves me with negative four but i squared is negative one that
leaves me with a positive four so what am i going to have here a three plus the four is seven i'm going
to have four i minus three i that leaves me with positive i and i'm going to divide that by two and all
i want is just to rewrite this a little bit i've got common term in the denominator so that's going to
be seven over two plus one over two i i have my real part and i have my imaginary part so very simple
to think about division as long as i understand the complex conjugate and i have seen that if i take
any complex number multiplying by its complex conjugate i'm going to get a real number and it's such an easy
real number i just take the real part squared and the imaginary part squared that's all and now that i have a
real number and the denominator it's very easy for me you know just to rewrite this into its separate
real and imaginary components i'm taking seven divided by two and i'm taking there's a one there
remember one divided by two that gives me the one over two over on that side so that's what we're going
to discuss as far as the arithmetic of complex numbers are concerned there are much more interesting
ways to look at these specifically when we are going to look at the argand diagram we're going to look
at the polar form of a complex number and then we when we talk about something like multiplication
we're going to see there's a whole different way to look at it which is actually a bit more useful
and a bit more fun but please you know get your favorite large language model make it do make it create
two numbers for you two complex numbers and tell it that you want to do the calculation and give it
back it's going to the large language model might give you you know two of these numbers like that
and you do the paperwork and you tell the the large language model this is my solution and it'll check
whether you are right or wrong obviously it's actually a lot of fun to do so that's a lot of fun
we've looked at so far at the imagine unit we've looked at complex numbers how to define them and we've
looked at the basic arithmetic when it comes to these now we're going to have a lot more fun what about
taking the sine of a complex number what about taking the natural logarithm or logarithm of a complex number
now we're going to get to some real fun but that's a couple of lectures down the line
