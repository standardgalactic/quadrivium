The text discusses trigonometric functions that are combined with polynomials and exponential terms, specifically focusing on expressions like \( e^{\alpha x} \cos(bx) \) and \( e^{\alpha x} \sin(bx) \), where the polynomial part ranges from a constant term to \( x^{n-1} \). These functions are transcendental due to their exponential nature. The text introduces an annihilating operator, \( D^2 - 2\alpha D + (\alpha^2 + \beta^2)^n \), which is used to handle these types of functions in differential equations. The operator order is one more than the polynomial degree present in the function. Future content will include examples illustrating how this concept works in practice.

The text discusses moving from basic examples to examining combined trigonometric and polynomial functions. It clarifies that these functions are transcendental due to their exponential component, although they include a polynomial part. Specifically, it mentions functions like \( e^{\alpha x} \cos(bx) \) and powers of \( x \) up to \( n-1 \). Similarly, for the sine function, an "annihilating operator" is introduced as \( d^2 - 2\alpha d + (\alpha^2 + \beta^2)^n \), which accounts for one additional term beyond those present in the functions. The discussion suggests that examples will be explored further in a subsequent video.
