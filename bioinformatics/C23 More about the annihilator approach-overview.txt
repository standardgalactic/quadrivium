The text discusses trigonometric functions that are combined with polynomials and exponential terms, specifically focusing on expressions like \( e^{\alpha x} \cos(bx) \) and \( e^{\alpha x} \sin(bx) \), where the polynomial part ranges from a constant term to \( x^{n-1} \). These functions are transcendental due to their exponential nature. The text introduces an annihilating operator, \( D^2 - 2\alpha D + (\alpha^2 + \beta^2)^n \), which is used to handle these types of functions in differential equations. The operator order is one more than the polynomial degree present in the function. Future content will include examples illustrating how this concept works in practice.
