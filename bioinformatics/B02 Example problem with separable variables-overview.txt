The text describes solving a separable differential equation: \( (1 + x) \, dy - y \, dx = 0 \). The approach involves expressing it as two separate functions of different variables:

1. Rearrange the equation to \(\frac{dy}{y} = \frac{dx}{1+x}\).
2. Integrate both sides: 
   \[
   \int \frac{1}{y} \, dy = \int \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx
   \]
3. This yields:
   \[
   \ln |y| = \ln |1 + x| + c_1
   \]

4. Exponentiate to remove the logarithms:
   \[
   y = e^{c_1} \cdot (1 + x)
   \]

5. Let \(e^{c_1} = c_2\), where \(c_2\) can be positive or negative, simplifying the solution to:
   \[
   y = c_2(1 + x)
   \]

This represents a family of solutions depending on the constant \(c_2\). The absolute value signs are omitted because \(c_2\) accounts for any sign variations.
