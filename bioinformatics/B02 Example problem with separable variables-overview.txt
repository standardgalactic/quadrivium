The text describes solving a separable differential equation: \( (1 + x) \, dy - y \, dx = 0 \). The approach involves expressing it as two separate functions of different variables:

1. Rearrange the equation to \(\frac{dy}{y} = \frac{dx}{1+x}\).
2. Integrate both sides: 
   \[
   \int \frac{1}{y} \, dy = \int \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx
   \]
3. This yields:
   \[
   \ln |y| = \ln |1 + x| + c_1
   \]

4. Exponentiate to remove the logarithms:
   \[
   y = e^{c_1} \cdot (1 + x)
   \]

5. Let \(e^{c_1} = c_2\), where \(c_2\) can be positive or negative, simplifying the solution to:
   \[
   y = c_2(1 + x)
   \]

This represents a family of solutions depending on the constant \(c_2\). The absolute value signs are omitted because \(c_2\) accounts for any sign variations.

The text provides a step-by-step solution to a separable differential equation problem. Given the equation \( (1 + x) \, dy - y \, dx = 0 \), it explains how to separate variables by rewriting it as:

\[
(1 + x) \, dy = y \, dx
\]

Then, it is rearranged to:

\[
\frac{1}{y} \, dy = \frac{1}{1 + x} \, dx
\]

Next, both sides are integrated:

\[
\int \frac{1}{y} \, dy = \int \frac{1}{1 + x} \, dx
\]

This results in:

\[
\ln |y| = \ln |1 + x| + c_1
\]

By exponentiating both sides to eliminate the logarithms, we get:

\[
y = e^{c_1} (1 + x)
\]

Here, \( e^{c_1} \) is replaced by a constant \( c_2 \), leading to the solution:

\[
y = c_2 (1 + x)
\]

The text concludes that this represents a family of solutions, where different values of \( c_2 \) provide different specific solutions. The absolute value signs are omitted due to the nature of the exponential function allowing for both positive and negative values depending on the constant.
