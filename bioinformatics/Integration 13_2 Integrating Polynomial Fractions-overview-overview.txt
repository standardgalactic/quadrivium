The text provides a methodical approach to simplifying an algebraic expression involving fractions and polynomials through partial fraction decomposition. It focuses on dividing one polynomial \( P \) by another polynomial \( Q \), where the degree of \( P \) is less than that of \( Q \). The denominator \( Q \) has been factored into components: \( (X^2 - 1) \) and \( (X^2 + 1) \).

The task involves expressing a fraction as a sum of partial fractions, necessitating terms for each factor in the denominator. Specifically:
- A term with coefficient \( A \) over \( X - 1 \).
- A first-degree polynomial \( BX + C \) over \( X^2 + 1 \).

Steps outlined include:

1. **Solving for \( A \)**: Multiply both sides by \( (X - 1) \), then set \( X = 1 \) to eliminate terms involving \( B \). This allows calculation of \( A \) as \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Determining \( B \) and \( C \)**: With \( A \) known, clear the fraction by multiplying with \( (X^2 + 1) \), then compare coefficients:
   - For \( X^2 \): Equate left side's coefficient of 1 to right side's \( \frac{1}{2} + B \), resulting in \( B = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - For constant terms: Equate zero on the left side to \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 - C \) on the right, yielding \( C = \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Substitution and Result**: Substitute back the values \( A = \frac{1}{2} \), \( B = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( C = \frac{1}{2} \) into the original expression.

The outcome is a factorized polynomial that can be integrated, demonstrating how partial fraction decomposition aids in simplifying expressions for integration.
