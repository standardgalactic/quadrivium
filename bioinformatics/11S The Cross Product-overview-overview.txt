The text provides a mathematical breakdown of vector operations related to calculating the area of a triangle in 3D space and finding the height from a point to a line. Hereâ€™s a concise summary:

### Vector Calculations

1. **Vector Operations:**
   - The discussion involves vectors and their cross products, specifically focusing on calculating the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

2. **Triangle Area Calculation:**
   - The area \(A\) of the parallelogram formed by vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is given by:
     \[
     A = \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|
     \]
   - The triangle's area is half of this value:
     \[
     \text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{26}/2
     \]

3. **Implication:**
   - The magnitude of the cross product is \(\sqrt{26}\).

### Height Calculation

1. **Height from a Point to a Line:**
   - To find the height \(h\) from point \(C\) to line \(AB\), use:
     \[
     h = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}
     \]

2. **Given Vectors:**
   - Vector \(\mathbf{b} = (-1, 2, 2)\).
   - Its norm is calculated as:
     \[
     \|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 2^2} = 3
     \]

3. **Height Calculation:**
   - The height \(h\) is determined by:
     \[
     h = \frac{\sqrt{26}}{3}
     \]

### Conclusion

- The calculations demonstrate that the area of a triangle remains consistent regardless of which vectors define it, as long as they describe the same geometric shape.
- This consistency allows for accurate calculation of the height from a vertex to the opposite side using the cross product magnitude and base length.
