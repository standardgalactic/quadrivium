The text explains the concept of the "centralizer" in group theory. For an arbitrary group \( G \) with a set and binary operation, the centralizer of a subset \( A \subseteq G \) consists of all elements \( g \in G \) that commute with every element in \( A \), meaning \( ga = ag \) for each \( a \in A \). The text proves that this centralizer is a subgroup of \( G \) by showing:

- **Associativity**: Inherited as the centralizer is a subset of \( G \).
- **Identity Element**: Exists in the centralizer because it commutes with all elements, including those in \( A \).
- **Closure**: If \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are in the centralizer, their product \( g_1g_2 \) is also in the centralizer, demonstrated by \( (g_1g_2)a = a(g_1g_2) \) for all \( a \in A \).
- **Inverses**: If \( g \) is in the centralizer, its inverse \( g^{-1} \) is also in the centralizer, shown by \( g^{-1}a = ag^{-1} \) for all \( a \in A \).

The text concludes that the centralizer of any single element or arbitrary subset forms a subgroup.
