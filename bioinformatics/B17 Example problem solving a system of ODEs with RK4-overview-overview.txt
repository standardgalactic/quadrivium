The text outlines using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve a system of first-order differential equations: \( x' = 2x - y \) and \( y' = x \), with initial conditions \( x(0) = 1 \) and \( y(0) = 5 \). A step size of 0.05 is used for the calculations.

The solution involves computing intermediate values (m1, m2, m3, m4 for \( x' \) and k1, k2, k3, k4 for \( y' \)) through Runge-Kutta formulas at various points within each step interval.

A Python script is set up to visualize the solutions using Matplotlib. It plots \( x(t) \) with red squares and \( y(t) \) with green triangles over time from \( t = 0 \) to just below \( t = 1 \). This graph facilitates the visual analysis of how both functions evolve over the interval.
