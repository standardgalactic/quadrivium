In Lesson 4, titled "Functions," the focus is on exploring how to create and use functions in Julia. The instructor begins by verifying that the coding environment is set up correctly using a simple operation (2 + 2) to ensure everything runs smoothly.

The lesson introduces functions as powerful tools in programming, emphasizing their utility and versatility. Rather than starting with a generic function syntax commonly used in textbooks, the instructor opts for an organic learning approach.

The first example presented is a mathematical-style function: \( f(x, y) = x^2 - 3y \). In computer programming, inputs like \( x \) and \( y \) are referred to as arguments. Depending on the values passed to these arguments, different outputs can be produced.

Throughout the lesson, various aspects of functions in Julia will be covered:
- Single expression functions (like the initial example).
- Multiple expression functions.
- Optional arguments and functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
- Passing arrays as function arguments for multiple inputs and outputs.
- Type parameters, "stabby" syntax, and do blocks.
- Using functions as arguments, which allows passing not just values or data types but entire functions into other functions.
- Nested functions (functions within functions).
- Multiple dispatch, a core concept in how Julia handles and optimizes function calls.

The lesson will also explore built-in functions provided by Julia's base system, demonstrating their extensive use in programming with the language. Additionally, list comprehensions will be touched upon to show another useful feature of Julia, even within the context of learning about functions. The next section will delve into single expression functions, setting the stage for deeper exploration of function syntax and functionality in Julia.
