The text provides an introduction to solving linear differential equations, specifically focusing on first-order linear equations. It explains that such an equation is composed of a function \( g(x) \) as the result of adding a function of \( x \) multiplied by the first derivative of \( y \), and another function of \( x \) multiplied by \( y \). This form can be simplified to what is called the "standard form" by dividing everything by the coefficient function associated with the first derivative, which results in a constant coefficient.

The text introduces two functions: \( p(x) = \frac{a_0(x)}{a_1(x)} \), which multiplies the derivative of \( y \), and \( f(x) \), which is on the right side of the equation. The solution to such an equation can be found over an interval where both \( p(x) \) and \( f(x) \) are continuous.

A key point highlighted is that solutions to linear equations can be expressed as the sum of two parts: \( y_c \), the solution to the associated homogeneous equation (where \( f(x) = 0 \)), and a particular solution (\( y_p \)) for the non-homogeneous case. The text explains how to solve the homogeneous part using separation of variables, leading to an integrating factor that simplifies solving the standard form.

The concept of an "integrating factor" is emphasized as crucial for making the equation easier to handle and will be explored further in subsequent examples.
