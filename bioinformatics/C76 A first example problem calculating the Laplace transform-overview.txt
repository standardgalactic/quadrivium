The text describes the process of finding the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = t \). It starts by defining the Laplace transform as an improper integral from 0 to infinity of \( e^{-st} \cdot t \, dt \). The solution involves integration by parts, where \( u = t \) and \( dv = e^{-st} \, dt \), leading to \( du = dt \) and \( v = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \).

Applying integration by parts, the expression becomes:

\[ uv - \int v \, du = \left[-\frac{t}{s} e^{-st}\right]_0^\infty + \int \frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \, dt. \]

Evaluating the boundary term \( \left[-\frac{t}{s} e^{-st}\right]_0^\infty \) results in 0 because as \( t \to \infty \), \( t e^{-st} \to 0 \).

The remaining integral \( \int \frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \, dt \) is recognized as the Laplace transform of 1, which equals \( \frac{1}{s} \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{s^2}. \]

Thus, the Laplace transform of \( t \) is \( \frac{1}{s^2} \). The text also notes that this fits a pattern where the Laplace transform of \( t^n \) is \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \), as demonstrated by previous examples with \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \).
