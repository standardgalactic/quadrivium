The text outlines a problem-solving approach for analyzing refraction and polarization of light at an interface between two media. Here are the key components:

1. **Snell's Law**: This law relates the angle of incidence (\(\theta_i\)) and the angle of refraction (\(\theta_t\)) to the indices of refraction (\(Ni\) and \(Nt\)) of the two media through the equation:
   \[
   Ni \cdot \sin(\theta_i) = Nt \cdot \sin(\theta_t)
   \]

2. **Critical Angle**: The critical angle (\(\theta_c\)) is calculated for total internal reflection in a denser medium using:
   \[
   \theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{Nt}{Ni}\right)
   \]
   For \( Ni = 1.58 \) and \( Nt = 1.53 \), the critical angle is approximately \(75.547^\circ\).

3. **Brewster's Angle**: This angle (\(\theta_B\)) results in completely polarized reflected light perpendicular to the plane of incidence, calculated as:
   \[
   \theta_B = \arctan\left(\frac{Nt}{Ni}\right)
   \]
   For a water-air interface with \( Ni = 1.00 \) and \( Nt = 1.33 \), Brewster's angle is approximately \(53.1^\circ\).

4. **Verification at Brewster's Angle**: At this angle, the reflected (\(\theta_r\)) and refracted (\(\theta_t\)) rays are perpendicular:
   - \(\theta_r\) equals \(\theta_i = \theta_B\).
   - The sum of \(\theta_r\) and \(\theta_t\) is \(90^\circ\).

Using Snell's law, the angle of refraction at Brewster's angle is found with:
\[
\sin(\theta_t) = \frac{Ni}{Nt} \cdot \sin(\theta_B)
\]
For given values, \(\theta_t\) is approximately \(36.9^\circ\), confirming that \(\theta_r + \theta_t = 90^\circ\).

The calculations and understanding of these optical concepts are confirmed to be correct.
