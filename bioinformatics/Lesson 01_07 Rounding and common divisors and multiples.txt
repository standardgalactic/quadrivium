Let's just move to the rounding of numbers. We can round to the nearest integer using the round
function. So let's do a round. So we can call the round function 3.4 and that's going to round of
course to the floating point value 3.0. It is only at values of 5 that it starts rounding up. So 3.5
is going to round up to 4. Now what we can do is force the issue so that it always rounds towards
positive infinity side and we can do that with a ceiling function. C E I L. So if I put in 3.001
normally that of course would round to 3 but I'm forcing the issue so that it rounds to positive
infinity side so that's going to give me a 4. Same with ceiling on the negative number side. So let's
take negative 3.999 you know that's going to of course round to negative 4 but I'm forcing it
towards the positive infinity side of the real line so that is going to go to negative 3. I can
force it to go to the floor side. Now floor means it's going to go towards negative infinity so 3.999
which you can think rounds to 4. If I force the issue it's going to go towards the negative infinity
side. The same will go for say negative 3.001 which is going to go to negative 4. We're forcing it in
that direction. We can go a step further and Julia we can also force things towards the zero and for
that I use trunc. So if I use 3.999 that's going to go down to the zero side which is 3 but on the other
hand if I use the truncate or trunk if I do negative 3.999 it's going to go towards the zero
side which is going to be 3. Let's move on. I just want to show you greatest common divisor and least
common multiple. Now the greatest common divider greatest common divider there we go that's a
function. So let's take this example that I've put down there 4, 8, 20. So it's going to look at
what can we divide into all of those numbers that will leave us with a zero remainder with a zero
remainder. Of course I can divide 1 into each of those. 1 goes into 4 times, 1 goes into 8, 8 times,
1 goes into 20. So 1 would be a common divisor without any remainders but I want the largest
possible one and it looks like 4 can go into itself, 4 can go into 8 and 4 can go into 20.
So indeed 4 is going to be my greatest common divisor. The least common multiple on the other
hand let's have a look at that. Least common multiple let's do the 3, the 5, the 2, the 3,
the 5 and the 10 I looked at. Now it's going to take multiples of those. What are multiples of 2? 2,
4, 6, 8. Multiples of 3, 3, 6, 9 etc. 5. So it's 5, 10, 15, 10 is 10, 20, 30.
So it's going to plot out all of those, all of those multiples and it's going to see which one
is the smallest common one amongst all of those. So let's have a look at that. It returns a 30.
So for 2 we're going to have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 until we get to 30, 3, 6, 9, 12 until we get to 30,
5 until we get to 30 and then 10, 20, 30. So 10 of course is going to play the huge role so
from 10 we'll go to, we'll have to go to 20 because remember 3 cannot go into 10 without a
remainder. 20, 3, well 3 can't go in there. 30, yes they can all go into 30, that's going to be
the smallest common multiple. So those greatest common divisor and least common multiple you can
use to great effect in your calculations.
30, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 5, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10.
