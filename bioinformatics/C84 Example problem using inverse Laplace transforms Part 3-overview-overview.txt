The text outlines a method for solving differential equations using Laplace transforms. Here's a summary:

1. **Laplace Transforms:** The functions \( x_1(t) \) and \( x_2(t) \) are transformed into the s-domain as \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \).

2. **Algebraic Manipulation:** These transforms are set up based on differential equations, aiming to solve them algebraically for \( X_1(s) \) and \( X_2(s) \).

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:** The expressions are broken down into simpler fractions to ease the process of taking inverse Laplace transforms.

4. **Inverse Laplace Transforms:** The solutions are converted back from the s-domain to the time domain using known transformations, such as recognizing that \( \frac{1}{s^2 + a^2} \) corresponds to \( \sin(at) \).

5. **Solving for \( X_2(s) \):** The expression for \( X_2(s) \) is decomposed into partial fractions and each term is inverted using known transforms.

6. **Final Expression:** After applying inverse Laplace transforms, the solution for \( x_2(t) \) is given by:

   \[ x_2(t) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{5} \sin(\sqrt{2}t) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{10} \sin(2\sqrt{3}t) \]

This process exemplifies the use of Laplace transforms to solve differential equations, especially beneficial for systems with initial conditions. If further clarification is needed on any step, additional questions are welcome.
