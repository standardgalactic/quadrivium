The text you provided seems to be discussing wave mechanics and how to solve related problems using concepts such as phase angle, wavelength (\(\lambda\)), wave number (\(k\)), angular frequency (\(\omega\)), and velocity. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Phase Angle**: 
   - The phase angle \(\phi\) is crucial in determining how waves overlap or interfere. It can be found using the formula:
     \[
     y_{\text{resultant}} = 2A \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Here, \(A\) is the amplitude of each wave.

2. **Wave Number (\(k\))**:
   - Defined as \(k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\), where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength.
   - It indicates how many wavelengths fit into a unit distance and relates to spatial frequency.

3. **Angular Frequency (\(\omega\))**:
   - Given by \(\omega = 2\pi f\), where \(f\) is the frequency of the wave.
   - It represents how rapidly the wave oscillates in time.

4. **Velocity (\(v\))**:
   - The velocity of a wave can be determined using \(v = f\lambda\) or equivalently \(v = \frac{\omega}{k}\).
   - A negative sign for velocity indicates the direction of wave propagation (e.g., negative x-direction).

5. **Equation Formulation**:
   - For a wave traveling in the negative x-direction, the general form is \(y(x,t) = A \sin(kx + \omega t + \phi)\).
   - If \(v\) is negative, ensure that the sign in front of \(\omega t\) is consistent with this direction.

6. **Problem Solving**:
   - To solve problems involving these concepts, identify given values and relationships, such as velocity, wavelength, frequency, etc.
   - Use graphs to determine amplitude and wavelength visually if needed.
   - Calculate \(k\), \(\omega\), and phase angle using the formulas provided.

In summary, solving wave mechanics problems involves understanding how waves interact (through phase angles), identifying wave properties (like number and frequency), and applying these in equations that describe wave motion. The direction of travel is indicated by the sign of velocity and must be consistent throughout calculations.
