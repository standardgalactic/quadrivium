To continue from where you left off, let's delve into how you can solve for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \) using matrix algebra. Here's a structured approach:

### Step 1: Set Up the System of Equations

You have two equations derived from your setup:

1. \( u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2 = 0 \)
2. \( u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2' = f(x) \)

These can be expressed in matrix form as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 & y_2 \\
y_1' & y_2'
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1' \\
u_2'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the System Using Matrix Inversion

To solve for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \), you can use the inverse of the coefficient matrix, provided it is invertible. The coefficient matrix is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
y_1 & y_2 \\
y_1' & y_2'
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\text{det}(A) = y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'
\]

Assuming the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of \( A \) is:

\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_2' & -y_2 \\
-y_1' & y_1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Solution

Multiply both sides of the matrix equation by \( A^{-1} \):

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1' \\
u_2'
\end{bmatrix}
=
A^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This results in:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1' \\
u_2'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_2' & -y_2 \\
-y_1' & y_1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Carrying out the multiplication gives:

\[
u_1' = \frac{-y_2 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
\]
\[
u_2' = \frac{y_1 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
\]

### Step 4: Integrate to Find \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \)

Integrate \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
u_1(x) = \int \frac{-y_2 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'} \, dx
\]

\[
u_2(x) = \int \frac{y_1 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'} \, dx
\]

### Conclusion

The functions \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) are found by integrating the expressions for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \). These integrals will give you the particular solution to your non-homogeneous differential equation using the method of variation of parameters.
