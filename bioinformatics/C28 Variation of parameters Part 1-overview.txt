To continue from where you left off, let's delve into how you can solve for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \) using matrix algebra. Here's a structured approach:

### Step 1: Set Up the System of Equations

You have two equations derived from your setup:

1. \( u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2 = 0 \)
2. \( u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2' = f(x) \)

These can be expressed in matrix form as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 & y_2 \\
y_1' & y_2'
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1' \\
u_2'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the System Using Matrix Inversion

To solve for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \), you can use the inverse of the coefficient matrix, provided it is invertible. The coefficient matrix is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
y_1 & y_2 \\
y_1' & y_2'
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\text{det}(A) = y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'
\]

Assuming the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of \( A \) is:

\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_2' & -y_2 \\
-y_1' & y_1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Solution

Multiply both sides of the matrix equation by \( A^{-1} \):

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1' \\
u_2'
\end{bmatrix}
=
A^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This results in:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1' \\
u_2'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_2' & -y_2 \\
-y_1' & y_1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
f(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Carrying out the multiplication gives:

\[
u_1' = \frac{-y_2 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
\]
\[
u_2' = \frac{y_1 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'}
\]

### Step 4: Integrate to Find \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \)

Integrate \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
u_1(x) = \int \frac{-y_2 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'} \, dx
\]

\[
u_2(x) = \int \frac{y_1 f(x)}{y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'} \, dx
\]

### Conclusion

The functions \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) are found by integrating the expressions for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \). These integrals will give you the particular solution to your non-homogeneous differential equation using the method of variation of parameters.

It looks like you are delving into the method of variation of parameters for solving non-homogeneous second-order linear differential equations. This method involves finding particular solutions by varying constants from the complementary solution (homogeneous equation). Here's a step-by-step guide based on your description:

1. **Identify the Homogeneous Solution**: 
   - For a differential equation of the form \( y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = f(x) \), first solve the homogeneous equation \( y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0 \).
   - Suppose the solutions are \( y_1(x) \) and \( y_2(x) \).

2. **Formulate the Particular Solution**:
   - Assume a particular solution of the form \( y_p(x) = u_1(x)y_1(x) + u_2(x)y_2(x) \), where \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) are functions to be determined.

3. **Derive Conditions for \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \)**:
   - To find \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \), differentiate \( y_p(x) \):
     \[
     y_p' = u_1'y_1 + u_1y_1' + u_2'y_2 + u_2y_2'
     \]
   - Impose the condition:
     \[
     u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2 = 0
     \]
   - This simplifies the expression for \( y_p'' \) and helps isolate terms involving \( f(x) \).

4. **Solve for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \)**:
   - With the condition above, differentiate again to get:
     \[
     y_p'' = u_1'y_1' + u_1y_1'' + u_2'y_2' + u_2y_2''
     \]
   - Substitute \( y_p \), \( y_p' \), and \( y_p'' \) into the original non-homogeneous equation:
     \[
     (u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2') + p(x)(u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2 + u_1y_1' + u_2y_2') + q(x)(u_1y_1 + u_2y_2) = f(x)
     \]
   - Using the condition \( u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2 = 0 \), simplify to:
     \[
     u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2' + p(x)(u_1y_1' + u_2y_2') + q(x)(u_1y_1 + u_2y_2) = f(x)
     \]
   - Recognize that \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) satisfy the homogeneous equation, so:
     \[
     u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2' = f(x)
     \]

5. **Set Up a System of Equations**:
   - You now have two equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2 &= 0 \\
     u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2' &= f(x)
     \end{align*}
     \]

6. **Solve the System Using Cramer's Rule**:
   - Write the system in matrix form:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     y_1 & y_2 \\
     y_1' & y_2'
     \end{bmatrix}
     \begin{bmatrix}
     u_1' \\
     u_2'
     \end{bmatrix}
     =
     \begin{bmatrix}
     0 \\
     f(x)
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Solve for \( u_1' \) and \( u_2' \) using determinants:
     \[
     u_1' = \frac{\det\begin{bmatrix} 0 & y_2 \\ f(x) & y_2' \end{bmatrix}}{\det\begin{bmatrix} y_1 & y_2 \\ y_1' & y_2' \end{bmatrix}}, \quad
     u_2' = \frac{\det\begin{bmatrix} y_1 & 0 \\ y_1' & f(x) \end{bmatrix}}{\det\begin{bmatrix} y_1 & y_2 \\ y_1' & y_2' \end{bmatrix}}
     \]

7. **Integrate to Find \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \)**:
   - Integrate \( u_1'(x) \) and \( u_2'(x) \) to find \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \).

8. **Construct the Particular Solution**:
   - Substitute back into \( y_p(x) = u_1(x)y_1(x) + u_2(x)y_2(x) \).

9. **General Solution**:
   - The general solution to the original differential equation is:
     \[
     y(x) = c_1y_1(x) + c_2y_2(x) + y_p(x)
     \]
   - Where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants determined by initial conditions.

This method effectively uses the structure of the homogeneous solution to construct a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation.
