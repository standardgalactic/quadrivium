The text explains how to handle repeated eigenvalues in matrices, focusing on cases where a real eigenvalue appears more than once. When solving the characteristic polynomial of a matrix \( A \), if an eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 \) repeats (e.g., \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -3 \)), there are two scenarios:

1. **Multiple Eigenvectors**: If you can find multiple linearly independent eigenvectors for the repeated eigenvalue, you construct solutions using these vectors and constants.

2. **Single Eigenvector**: If only one eigenvector is found, generalized eigenvectors are used to form a solution set. This involves constructing a series of functions with powers of \( t \) and factorials in the denominators, which reflect the multiplicity of the eigenvalue.

For example, if an eigenvalue has multiplicity 2, the solution might involve terms like \( k e^{\lambda_1 t} \), \( (pt + k) e^{\lambda_1 t} \). For higher multiplicities, this pattern continues with increasing powers of \( t \).

The text also mentions that these solutions can be verified by differentiating and substituting back into the matrix equation \( x' = Ax \), ensuring consistency with linear algebra principles.
