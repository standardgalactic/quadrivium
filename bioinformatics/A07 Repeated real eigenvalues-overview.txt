The text explains how to handle repeated eigenvalues in matrices, focusing on cases where a real eigenvalue appears more than once. When solving the characteristic polynomial of a matrix \( A \), if an eigenvalue \( \lambda_1 \) repeats (e.g., \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -3 \)), there are two scenarios:

1. **Multiple Eigenvectors**: If you can find multiple linearly independent eigenvectors for the repeated eigenvalue, you construct solutions using these vectors and constants.

2. **Single Eigenvector**: If only one eigenvector is found, generalized eigenvectors are used to form a solution set. This involves constructing a series of functions with powers of \( t \) and factorials in the denominators, which reflect the multiplicity of the eigenvalue.

For example, if an eigenvalue has multiplicity 2, the solution might involve terms like \( k e^{\lambda_1 t} \), \( (pt + k) e^{\lambda_1 t} \). For higher multiplicities, this pattern continues with increasing powers of \( t \).

The text also mentions that these solutions can be verified by differentiating and substituting back into the matrix equation \( x' = Ax \), ensuring consistency with linear algebra principles.

The text discusses scenarios involving repeated eigenvalues in matrices, particularly when solving characteristic polynomials. It begins by addressing cases where eigenvalues are distinct but quickly transitions to situations where they repeat. For a quadratic equation like \(\lambda^2 + 6\lambda + 9 = 0\), it results in a repeated eigenvalue of \(-3\). The presentation then considers what happens when dealing with higher-order polynomials and matrices, such as a 3x3 matrix that might yield another distinct eigenvalue.

For real repeated eigenvalues, two possibilities are discussed:

1. **Multiple Eigenvectors**: If multiple linearly independent eigenvectors exist for the repeated eigenvalue \(\lambda_1\), solutions involve combinations of these eigenvectors multiplied by constants and exponential terms \(e^{\lambda_1 t}\).

2. **Single Eigenvector**: When only one eigenvector is available, generalized eigenvectors are used to construct a solution set. This involves constructing vectors like \(x_m = (k + pt^{m-1} + \dots) e^{\lambda_1 t}\), where the terms decrease in power of \(t\).

The text explains that if only one eigenvector is found, additional solutions are constructed using powers of \(t\) and factorials to ensure linear independence. It also mentions how these solutions can be verified by equating derivatives (using matrix operations) and ensuring they satisfy differential equations.

Finally, the presentation emphasizes understanding through examples and revisiting fundamental concepts from linear algebra to make sense of the construction of solutions in cases with repeated eigenvalues.
