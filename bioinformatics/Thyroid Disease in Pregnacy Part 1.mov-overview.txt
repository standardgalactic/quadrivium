Thyroid disease is common among women of childbearing age but can be overlooked during pregnancy due to its subtle symptoms and the hypermetabolic state associated with pregnancy. Proper diagnosis and management are crucial for ensuring a healthy pregnancy because thyroid dysfunction can directly affect the fetus through transplacental movement of antibodies, hormones, and drugs, as well as indirectly via abnormal maternal physiology.

To diagnose thyroid disease in pregnant women, it is essential to understand the physiological changes in thyroid function during pregnancy. These changes include increased levels of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), which expands the hormone pool and leads to greater production of T4 and T3 hormones. This increase is further stimulated by elevated renal iodide loss due to increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and transplacental transfer of T4 and iodide.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), which has intrinsic thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) activity, also stimulates the thyroid during pregnancy. HCG levels peak around 10 weeks gestation before decreasing to a low at 20 weeks. Consequently, TSH levels typically decrease relative to preconception and late pregnancy values.

Free T4 levels can vary significantly between individuals and specific pregnancies, so it may be appropriate to consider total T4 levels within normal reference ranges that are 1 to 1.5 times higher than non-pregnant female values. These complex changes necessitate careful consideration when diagnosing thyroid disease during pregnancy. The next discussion will focus on hypothyroidism in pregnancy.
