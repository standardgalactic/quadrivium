The text provides an explanation of differentiation and integration involving the exponential function \( e^u \), where \( u \) is a differentiable function of \( x \).

### Differentiation:
- The derivative of \( e^u \) with respect to \( x \) is given by:
  \[
  \frac{d}{dx} (e^u) = e^u \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
  \]
  Here, \( u \) is a function of \( x \).

### Integration:
- The indefinite integral of \( e^u \) with respect to \( u \) is:
  \[
  \int e^u \, du = e^u + C
  \]
  This does not imply that any expression involving \( e \) can be directly rewritten as \( e^u + C \) unless \( u \) is a function of \( x \).

### Example: Definite Integral from 0 to \(\ln(2)\)
- Consider the integral:
  \[
  \int_{0}^{\ln(2)} e^{3x} \, dx
  \]
  - Substitute \( u = 3x \), so \( du/dx = 3 \) or \( dx = \frac{1}{3} du \).
  - Change the limits: 
    - When \( x = 0 \), \( u = 0 \).
    - When \( x = \ln(2) \), \( u = 3\ln(2) = \ln(8) \).
  - The integral becomes:
    \[
    \frac{1}{3} \int_{0}^{\ln(8)} e^u \, du
    \]
  - Evaluate:
    \[
    \frac{1}{3} [e^u]_{0}^{\ln(8)} = \frac{1}{3} (e^{\ln(8)} - e^0) = \frac{1}{3} (8 - 1) = \frac{7}{3}
    \]

### Another Example: Definite Integral from \(0\) to \(\pi/2\)
- Consider the integral:
  \[
  \int_{0}^{\pi/2} e^{\sin x} \cos x \, dx
  \]
  - Substitute \( u = \sin x \), so \( du/dx = \cos x \) or \( du = \cos x \, dx \).
  - Change the limits:
    - When \( x = 0 \), \( u = 0 \).
    - When \( x = \pi/2 \), \( u = 1 \).
  - The integral becomes:
    \[
    \int_{0}^{1} e^u \, du
    \]
  - Evaluate:
    \[
    [e^u]_{0}^{1} = e^1 - e^0 = e - 1
    \]

These examples illustrate how to handle integration involving the exponential function by using substitution and adjusting limits accordingly.
