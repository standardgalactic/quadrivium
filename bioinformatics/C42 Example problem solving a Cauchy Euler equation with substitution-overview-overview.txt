The text describes a method for solving a differential equation through variable substitution and transformation. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. **Variable Substitution**: The substitution \( x = e^t \) (or \( t = \ln(x) \)) is used to simplify the process of solving the differential equation.

2. **Derivatives Calculation**: Using the new variable \( t \), derivatives are expressed as:
   - First derivative: \( y' = \frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dt} \)
   - Second derivative: \( y'' = \frac{1}{x^2} \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} \)

3. **Equation Transformation**: The original differential equation is transformed into:
   \[
   \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - 2\frac{dy}{dt} + y = t
   \]

4. **Homogeneous Solution**:
   - Solve the homogeneous part with the auxiliary equation: \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (m-1)^2 = 0 \).
   - Solutions are \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \).
   - The complementary solution is given by \( y_c = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t \).

5. **Particular Solution**:
   - Assume a particular solution of the form \( y_p = a + bt \).
   - Calculate derivatives: \( y_p' = b \), \( y_p'' = 0 \).
   - Substitute into the transformed equation to solve for coefficients, yielding \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 1 \).
   - Thus, the particular solution is \( y_p = 2 + t \).

6. **General Solution**: Combine the complementary and particular solutions:
   \[
   y(t) = c_1 e^t + c_2 t e^t + 2 + t
   \]

7. **Back to Original Variable**: Convert back to \( x \) by replacing \( t \) with \( \ln(x) \):
   - The final solution is:
     \[
     y(x) = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) + 2 + \ln(x)
     \]

The method demonstrates the utility of substitution and transformation in solving differential equations by simplifying the process into manageable steps.
