The text explains how to calculate the force between two parallel, current-carrying wires using concepts from magnetism:

1. **Magnetic Field of a Wire**: A long, straight wire with current \(I\) creates a magnetic field (\(B\)) given by \(\mu_0 I / (2 \pi d)\), where \(d\) is the distance from the wire and \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space.

2. **Force Between Wires**: The force between two parallel wires depends on their currents' directions:
   - Parallel currents attract.
   - Opposite currents repel.

3. **Ampère's Law**: This law helps determine the magnetic field around a wire, stating that the integral of \(B\) over a closed loop equals \(\mu_0\) times the enclosed current, leading to \(B = \mu_0 I / (2 \pi r)\).

4. **Cross Product for Force**: The force per unit length between wires is calculated using \(F/L = I_1 B_2\), where \(I_1\) is the current in one wire and \(B_2\) is the magnetic field from the other wire.

5. **Symmetry in Ampère's Law**: Using symmetry, such as a circular path around a straight wire, simplifies calculations by considering the enclosed current to determine the magnetic field integral.

These principles illustrate how electromagnetic interactions occur between wires with electric currents.
