The text explores autonomous systems of first-order ordinary differential equations where the independent variable (typically time) does not appear explicitly. Such systems are characterized by multiple variables that change over time according to specific functions. When represented in vector form, these systems can be analyzed through associated vector fields, which describe the velocity or direction at each point in space.

For autonomous systems with two variables (\(x\) and \(y\)), known as "plain" autonomous systems, the analysis focuses on understanding how the system's state evolves over time. This involves identifying equilibrium or critical points where derivatives are zero, indicating the system is at rest. To find these critical points, one sets the right-hand side of each equation to zero and solves for \(x\) and \(y\). Solutions can represent equilibrium points, trajectories (arcs), or periodic motion.

The text outlines a specific process involving algebraic manipulation and linear algebra:

1. **Equation Setup**: Two equations are considered:
   - \( x^2 + y + 12 = 0 \)
   - \( x^2 - y = 0 \) (implying \( x^2 = y \))

   Substituting \( y = x^2 \) into the first equation results in a quadratic:
   - \( y^2 + y + 12 = 0 \)

2. **Solving Quadratic**: Solving this yields roots \( y = -4 \) or \( y = 3 \). Only \( y = 3 \) is considered valid (real number).

3. **Finding \( x \)**: With \( y = 3 \), it follows that \( x^2 = 3 \), giving:
   - \( x = \pm\sqrt{3} \)

4. **Critical Points**: The critical points are \( (-\sqrt{3}, 3) \) and \( (\sqrt{3}, 3) \).

5. **Linear Algebra Approach**:
   - A matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 8 \\ -1 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \) is introduced.
   - The characteristic equation for eigenvalues is derived from \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \).
   - Solving gives complex eigenvalues: \( \lambda = \pm 2i \).

6. **Eigenvector Calculation**:
   - For \( \lambda_1 = -2i \), solving \( (A + 2iI) \begin{pmatrix} k_1 \\ k_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0 \) with \( k_2 = 1 \) yields the eigenvector: \( \begin{pmatrix} -2 + 2i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

7. **Conclusion**: The process involves algebraic manipulation to find critical points and linear algebra techniques for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, illustrating their interplay.

The text also describes solving differential equations using exponential functions with constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), along with trigonometric components like cosine and sine. Initial value problems are solved by determining these constants, resulting in parametrized curves that can be arcs or periodic functions. The use of computer algebra systems for efficiency is mentioned.

The discussion concludes with an unrelated note about needing to take a phone call, suggesting the context might have been an informal tutorial session.
