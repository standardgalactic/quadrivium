This text explores both the anatomy and physiology of the appendix. Anatomically, it highlights that the appendix is located at the base of the cecum where the taenia coli converge, with a diameter of about 6 mm and variable length (2 to over 20 cm). The position of its tip can influence clinical symptoms, particularly during appendicitis. The appendix receives visceral nerve supply from around T10 level and pain localization changes as somatic nerves become involved.

The arterial supply to the appendix comes from the appendiceal artery, typically an end artery branching from the ileocolic artery. In cases where this artery is occluded due to inflammation or infection, necrosis and perforation can occur unless there are accessory arteries providing alternate blood flow, which may offer some protection against severe outcomes of appendicitis.

Venous drainage occurs through the portal system into the liver, historically leading to portal sepsis or liver abscesses pre-antibiotics. Lymphatic vessels follow the arterial supply and could facilitate systemic infection spread or cancer metastasis, with lymph nodes in this area potentially mimicking symptoms of acute appendicitis during infections.

Physiologically, the appendix contains T and B lymphocytes within its mucosa and submucosa, contributing to gut-associated lymphoid tissue. It plays a role in immune response by presenting antigens to lymphoid cells, initiating antibody production or maintaining infection defense in the distal gut.
