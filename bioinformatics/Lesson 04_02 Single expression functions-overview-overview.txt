The text introduces two syntax forms for creating functions in Julia: single-expression functions and multiple-expression functions.

1. **Single-Expression Functions**:
   - These are concise, using a mathematical-like format such as `f(x, y)`.
   - Example: A function named `f` takes arguments `x` and `y`, returning `x^2 - 3*y`. For instance, calling `f(2, 1)` results in `4 - 3 = 1`.
   - Another example is a function `g(x)` that returns `x^2`, so `g(3)` yields `9`.
   - The format involves naming the function, listing arguments in parentheses, and using an equal sign followed by the expression to compute.

2. **Multiple-Expression Functions**:
   - These allow for more complex logic or multiple operations within a function body but are not detailed in the text.

The text also mentions Julia's "multiple dispatch" feature, which allows different method implementations based on argument types, enhancing flexibility and efficiency. This concept is to be explored further.
