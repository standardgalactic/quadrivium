Myxedema coma, or hypothyroid coma, is a severe medical emergency linked to untreated hypothyroidism, with high mortality rates (20-30%). It commonly affects elderly women during winter. Contributing factors include hypothermia and events like acute coronary incidents, cerebrovascular issues, trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infections.

Diagnosis involves recognizing signs of hypothyroidism in a hypothermic patient, such as hypoventilation and bradycardia leading to cardiorespiratory failure. Fever is often absent due to masking by the condition. Laboratory tests show low thyroid hormones, elevated TSH (sometimes), anemia, hyponatremia, high LDH and CK levels, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypercholesterolemia, and arterial blood gas abnormalities like hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.

Management requires ICU admission for fluid, electrolyte management, hypoglycemia, and hypercalcemia treatment, along with ventilatory and cardiac support. Intravenous hydrocortisone is given to maintain stress hormone levels as thyroid hormone therapy increases metabolism. Intravenous T3 may be used cautiously in elderly patients due to its rapid action, starting at 10-20 mcg every four hours on the first day, tapering over two days.

As improvement occurs, oral thyroxine (50-100 mcg per day) can begin. Collecting body fluid samples for microbial analysis and performing a chest X-ray are crucial steps in management.
