The text provides a solution to an initial value problem given by the differential equation \(x^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = y - yx\) with the condition \(y(-1) = -1\). The steps involved in solving this are as follows:

1. **Separate Variables**: The equation is rearranged to separate variables, resulting in:
   \[
   \frac{1}{y} dy = \left(1 - x\right) \frac{1}{x^2} dx
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{1}{y} dy = \left(x^{-2} - x^{-1}\right) dx
   \]

2. **Integrate Both Sides**: Integrate both sides of the equation:
   - The left side integrates to \(\ln |y|\).
   - The right side integrates to \(-x^{-1} - \ln|x| + C\).

3. **Solve for \(y\)**: Exponentiate both sides to solve for \(y\):
   \[
   y = e^{C_1} \cdot e^{-1/x} \cdot \frac{1}{x}
   \]
   Here, \(e^{C_1}\) is replaced by a new constant \(c_2\), so:
   \[
   y = \frac{c_2}{xe^{1/x}}
   \]

4. **Apply Initial Condition**: Use the initial condition \(y(-1) = -1\) to find \(c_2\):
   - Substitute \(x = -1\) and \(y = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     -1 = \frac{c_2}{-e^{-1}}
     \]
   - Solve for \(c_2\), resulting in \(c_2 = \frac{1}{e}\).

5. **Final Solution**: Substitute \(c_2\) back into the expression for \(y\):
   \[
   y = \frac{1/e}{xe^{1/x}} = \frac{1}{x e^{1 + 1/x}}
   \]

This is the solution to the initial value problem.
