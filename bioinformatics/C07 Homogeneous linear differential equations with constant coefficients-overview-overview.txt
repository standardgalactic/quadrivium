The text outlines various approaches for solving first-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. It begins with the general equation \( ay' + by = 0 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and \( y \) is the dependent variable.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Exponential Solution**: The solution involves an exponential function \( y = e^{mx} \). Substituting this into the differential equation results in \( am + b = 0 \), yielding \( m = -\frac{b}{a} \).

2. **Example**: For the specific equation \( 2y' + 5y = 0 \) (where \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 5 \)), we find \( m = -\frac{5}{2} \). The solution is thus \( y = Ce^{-\frac{5}{2}x} \).

3. **Alternative Methods**:
   - **Separation of Variables**: Rearrange to get \( \frac{1}{y} dy = -\frac{5}{2} dx \), integrate both sides, and solve for \( y \).
   - **Integrating Factor**: Rewrite in standard form as \( y' + \frac{5}{2}y = 0 \). The integrating factor is \( e^{\frac{5}{2}x} \). Multiply through by this factor to simplify and integrate.

4. **Conclusion**: All methods consistently lead to the same solution, demonstrating their reliability for solving first-order linear differential equations. Understanding these techniques provides a foundation for addressing higher-order linear differential equations.
