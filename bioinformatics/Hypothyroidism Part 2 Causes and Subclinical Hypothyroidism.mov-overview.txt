This text discusses various causes of hypothyroidism, including iodine insufficiency, thyroiditis (particularly Hashimoto's), radioactive iodine treatment or surgery, certain medications like iodide, potassium perchlorate, lithium, and amiodarone, congenital issues with the thyroid gland, and secondary hypothyroidism due to hypothalamic or pituitary disorders such as tumors, metastases, hemorrhage, necrosis, aneurysms, surgical procedures, trauma, infections, infiltrative diseases, and chronic lymphocytic hypophysitis.

The text also introduces subclinical hypothyroidism, which shares the same causes as overt hypothyroidism. It has a conversion rate to overt hypothyroidism of about 4-18% per year and often represents early stages of these conditions. Many patients with subclinical hypothyroidism recover normal thyroid function, likely due to transient thyroiditis.

In laboratory diagnosis, subclinical hypothyroidism is identified by normal thyroid hormone levels and slightly elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels. Symptoms can range from a euthyroid state (normal thyroid function) to those associated with overt hypothyroidism. The next video will focus on the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism.

This text discusses causes of hypothyroidism, emphasizing subclinical hypothyroidism. Common causes include iodine insufficiency, Hashimoto thyroiditis, medications like amiodarone, thyroid surgery or ablation, and disorders affecting hormone production in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Subclinical hypothyroidism shares these causes but is characterized by normal thyroid hormone levels and slightly elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels. It often represents early stages of other conditions related to hypothyroidism, with a conversion rate to overt hypothyroidism ranging from 4-18% annually. Some patients may recover normal function, likely due to transient thyroiditis. The symptoms can range from none to those associated with overt hypothyroidism. Future discussions will cover the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism.
