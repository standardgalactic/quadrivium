The text discusses two main topics involving complex numbers: solving equations with conjugates and graphing inequalities in the complex plane.

1. **Solving for \( z \):**
   - The equation given is \( (4 - 3i) \overline{z} = i \).
   - Solving for \(\overline{z}\), we have:
     \[
     \overline{z} = \frac{i}{4 - 3i}
     \]
   - By multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we simplify it to:
     \[
     \overline{z} = \frac{-3 + 4i}{25} = -\frac{3}{25} + \frac{4}{25}i
     \]
   - The complex number \( z \) is found by taking the conjugate of \(\overline{z}\):
     \[
     z = -\frac{3}{25} - \frac{4}{25}i
     \]

2. **Graphing Inequalities in the Complex Plane:**
   - **First Inequality:** \(|z + i| \leq 1\)
     - This represents a circle centered at \( (0, -1) \) with radius 1, including all points inside and on its boundary.
   
   - **Second Inequality:** \(1 < |z| < 2\)
     - Describes an annular region between two circles: one with radius 1 (excluded) and another with radius 2 (included), both centered at the origin.

Additionally, the text covers other scenarios involving complex inequalities:

- The inequality \( b^2 + 2b + 1 \) simplifies to \( b > -\frac{1}{2} \), indicating values of \( b \) on the imaginary axis.
  
- **Division of Complex Numbers:**
  - Given \( z_1 = x_1 + iy_1 \) and \( z_2 = x_2 + iy_2 \), where \( z_2 \neq 0 \).
  - To divide, multiply by the conjugate of \( z_2 \):
    \[
    \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{(x_1 + iy_1)(x_2 - iy_2)}{x_2^2 + y_2^2}
    \]
  - This results in:
    - Real part: 
      \[
      \frac{x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2}{x_2^2 + y_2^2}
      \]
    - Imaginary part (without \( i \)):
      \[
      \frac{x_2 y_1 - x_1 y_2}{x_2^2 + y_2^2}
      \]

Overall, the text provides a method for solving complex equations involving conjugates and illustrates how to graphically represent inequalities in the complex plane.
