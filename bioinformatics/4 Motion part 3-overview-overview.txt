The text explains constant circular motion by describing it mathematically without using code. It starts with a position vector for an object moving along a circle with radius \( b \), where the angle change over time is given by angular velocity (\( \omega \)). The position of the object can be expressed using trigonometric functions: \( b \cos(\omega t) \) and \( b \sin(\omega t) \), modeling counter-clockwise motion. 

Differentiating this vector with respect to time yields the velocity, which has a constant magnitude of \( b\omega \). A further differentiation gives acceleration, directed towards the circle's center (centripetal acceleration) with magnitude \( b\omega^2 \).

The centripetal force needed for circular motion is derived using Newtonâ€™s second law and is given by \( m \omega^2 r \), where \( r = b \). This shows that centripetal force depends on the object's mass, angular velocity, and radius of the path. The text emphasizes these mathematical principles to understand constant circular motion dynamics.
