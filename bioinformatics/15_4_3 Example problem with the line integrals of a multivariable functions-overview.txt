The text outlines the process of evaluating a line integral over a curve \( C \) that consists of two piecewise smooth curves, \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \). The goal is to integrate a function only with respect to the \( x \)-direction.

**Curve \( C_1 \):**
- Starts at point (2, 0, 2) and ends at (0, 1, 0).
- Parametrized by:
  - \( x(t) = 2 - 2t \)
  - \( y(t) = t \)
  - \( z(t) = 2 - 2t \)
  - Where \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1.
- The derivative with respect to \( t \) is:
  - \( x'(t) = -2 \)
  - \( y'(t) = 1 \)
  - \( z'(t) = -2 \)
- The function to integrate is \( f(x, y, z) = 3x + 2y + z \).
- Substituting the parameterization into the function gives:
  - \( f(r(t)) = 6 - 6t + 8 \)
- The integral becomes:
  - \(\int_0^1 (-6t + 8)(-2) \, dt\)
  - Simplifying and evaluating yields a result of \(-10\).

**Curve \( C_2 \):**
- Described as a quarter circle at \( x = 0 \).
- Moves from (0, 1, 0) to (0, 0, 1).
- The specific parameterization for this curve is not fully detailed in the text.

The solution involves calculating the line integral over each segment and summing them if needed. For \( C_1 \), the result is \(-10\). Further details would be required to complete the evaluation for \( C_2 \).

The text discusses computing line integrals along curves in a coordinate space. It describes two scenarios:

1. **Curve C1**: A quarter circle traced from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = \frac{\pi}{2} \), parameterized by cosine and sine functions for x and y respectively, with z likely held constant.

2. **Curve C2**: Defined by \( x = 0 \), \( y = \cos(t) \), and \( z = \sin(t) \). Here, the line integral in the x direction is zero because there's no change in x (\( dx/dt = 0 \)). As a result, any function involving \( x \) only contributes nothing to the integral along this path.

The text also mentions that the overall curve considered is a union of curves C1 and C2. The line integral for curve C1 contributed a value (not detailed in the provided text), while the contribution from curve C2 is zero due to no movement in the x direction. Thus, the total line integral over both paths remains at \(-10\), which was previously determined from the integration along curve C1 alone.

The text describes the process of evaluating a line integral along a curve \( C \), which consists of two piecewise smooth curves, \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \). The focus is on integrating with respect to the direction \( x \).

### Curve \( C_1 \):
- **Description**: A straight line segment from the point (2, 0, 2) to (0, 1, 0).
- **Vector Function**: 
  - Parametrized by \( t \) where \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \).
  - Position vector: \( \mathbf{r}_1(t) = (2 - 2t, t, 2 - 2t) \).
- **Derivatives**:
  - \( x'(t) = -2 \), \( y'(t) = 1 \), \( z'(t) = -2 \).
- **Function to Integrate**: \( f(x, y, z) = 3x + 2y + z \).
- **Integral Calculation**:
  - Substitute the parametrization into \( f \): \( f(\mathbf{r}_1(t)) = 6 - 6t + 8 \).
  - Integral: \(\int_{0}^{1} (-6t + 8)(-2) \, dt = \int_{0}^{1} (12t - 16) \, dt\).
  - Result: \( 6t^2 - 16t \big|_0^1 = 6 - 16 = -10 \).

### Curve \( C_2 \):
- **Description**: A quarter-circle in the plane \( x = 0 \), from (0, 1, 0) to (0, 0, 1).
- **Parametrization**:
  - Likely involves trigonometric functions due to the circular path.
  - The exact parametrization isn't fully detailed but suggests a transition in \( y \) and \( z \).

The text outlines the steps for evaluating the line integral over \( C_1 \) and sets up the framework for \( C_2 \), emphasizing the use of parameter \( t \) to describe each segment.

The text describes a process of evaluating line integrals along two curves, \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \), in three-dimensional space.

For curve \( C_1 \), which is a quarter circle parameterized by:
- \( x = \cos(t) \)
- \( y = \sin(t) \)

The parameter \( t \) ranges from 0 to \( \frac{\pi}{2} \). The line integral along this curve involves the vector function \( f(x, y, z) = 3x + 2y + z \).

For curve \( C_2 \), which is a vertical segment parameterized by:
- \( x = 0 \)
- \( y = \cos(t) \)
- \( z = \sin(t) \)

Here, the derivative \( dx/dt = 0 \), indicating no change in the \( x \)-direction. Consequently, the line integral along this curve is zero because the contribution from the \( x \)-component of the vector function is nullified.

The overall line integral for the union of curves \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) results in a value that remains \(-10\), as previously calculated for curve \( C_1 \). The analysis confirms that the contribution from curve \( C_2 \) does not affect the total due to its zero line integral.
