The text outlines the process of evaluating a line integral over a curve \( C \) that consists of two piecewise smooth curves, \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \). The goal is to integrate a function only with respect to the \( x \)-direction.

**Curve \( C_1 \):**
- Starts at point (2, 0, 2) and ends at (0, 1, 0).
- Parametrized by:
  - \( x(t) = 2 - 2t \)
  - \( y(t) = t \)
  - \( z(t) = 2 - 2t \)
  - Where \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1.
- The derivative with respect to \( t \) is:
  - \( x'(t) = -2 \)
  - \( y'(t) = 1 \)
  - \( z'(t) = -2 \)
- The function to integrate is \( f(x, y, z) = 3x + 2y + z \).
- Substituting the parameterization into the function gives:
  - \( f(r(t)) = 6 - 6t + 8 \)
- The integral becomes:
  - \(\int_0^1 (-6t + 8)(-2) \, dt\)
  - Simplifying and evaluating yields a result of \(-10\).

**Curve \( C_2 \):**
- Described as a quarter circle at \( x = 0 \).
- Moves from (0, 1, 0) to (0, 0, 1).
- The specific parameterization for this curve is not fully detailed in the text.

The solution involves calculating the line integral over each segment and summing them if needed. For \( C_1 \), the result is \(-10\). Further details would be required to complete the evaluation for \( C_2 \).

The text discusses computing line integrals along curves in a coordinate space. It describes two scenarios:

1. **Curve C1**: A quarter circle traced from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = \frac{\pi}{2} \), parameterized by cosine and sine functions for x and y respectively, with z likely held constant.

2. **Curve C2**: Defined by \( x = 0 \), \( y = \cos(t) \), and \( z = \sin(t) \). Here, the line integral in the x direction is zero because there's no change in x (\( dx/dt = 0 \)). As a result, any function involving \( x \) only contributes nothing to the integral along this path.

The text also mentions that the overall curve considered is a union of curves C1 and C2. The line integral for curve C1 contributed a value (not detailed in the provided text), while the contribution from curve C2 is zero due to no movement in the x direction. Thus, the total line integral over both paths remains at \(-10\), which was previously determined from the integration along curve C1 alone.
