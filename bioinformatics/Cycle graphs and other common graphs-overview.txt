In your exploration of graph theory using the Wolfram language (Mathematica), you've encountered several fundamental types of graphs: cycle graphs, complete graphs, and utility graphs. Let's break down these concepts and explore how to work with them in Mathematica.

### Cycle Graphs

A cycle graph \( C_n \) is a graph that consists of a single cycle through all its vertices. It has \( n \) vertices and \( n \) edges. In Mathematica, you can create a cycle graph using the `CycleGraph` function:

```mathematica
cycleGraph = CycleGraph[4]
```

This will generate a cycle graph with 4 vertices.

### Complete Graphs

A complete graph \( K_n \) is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In Mathematica, you can create a complete graph using the `CompleteGraph` function:

```mathematica
completeGraph = CompleteGraph[4]
```

This will generate a complete graph with 4 vertices.

### Utility Graph

The utility graph, also known as \( K_{3,3} \), is a bipartite graph that connects two sets of three vertices. It's used in problems like the "three utilities problem." In Mathematica, you can access predefined graphs using `GraphData`:

```mathematica
utilityGraph = GraphData["UtilityGraph"]
```

### Complement of a Graph

The complement of a graph \( G \) is another graph on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices are adjacent in the complement if and only if they are not adjacent in \( G \). In Mathematica, you can find the complement of a graph using `Complement`:

```mathematica
complementGraph = Complement[cycleGraph]
```

This will give you the complement of the cycle graph with 4 vertices, effectively turning it into a complete graph minus the edges present in the original cycle.

### Using the Table Function

The `Table` function in Mathematica allows you to generate lists or arrays based on repeated evaluations. For example, to create graphs with varying numbers of vertices:

```mathematica
graphs = Table[{n, CycleGraph[n]}, {n, 1, 5}]
```

This will create a list of cycle graphs from \( C_1 \) to \( C_5 \).

### Exploring Graph Properties

You can explore various properties of these graphs using built-in functions. For example, the number of edges in a complete graph \( K_n \) is given by:

```mathematica
edgeCount[n_] := n (n - 1)/2
EdgeCount[completeGraph]
```

This will confirm that the edge count for a complete graph with 5 vertices is indeed 10.

### Conclusion

By using these functions and exploring their properties, you can gain a deeper understanding of graph theory concepts. Experiment with different numbers of vertices and types of graphs to see how they behave and relate to each other. Enjoy your journey into graph theory with Mathematica!
