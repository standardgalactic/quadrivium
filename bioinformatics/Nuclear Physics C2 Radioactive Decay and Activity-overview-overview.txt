The text provides an overview of radioactive decay and introduces key concepts like half-lifeâ€”the period required for half of a radioactive substance to decay. Using radon-222 as an example (with a half-life of 3.83 days), it illustrates how to calculate remaining nuclei over time, starting with 30 million units and showing that approximately 120,000 remain after 31 days through exponential decay principles.

The text then explores the mathematical representation of radioactive decay using calculus concepts, emphasizing the non-linear relationship between time and the number of radioactive nuclei. It explains this using a negative exponential function, where the rate of change is proportional to the current amount present, represented by the equation \( N = N_0 \times e^{-\lambda t} \).

The discussion extends to deriving the decay constant (\(\lambda\)) from the half-life using natural logarithms: 

\[ \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}. \]

This relationship is used in practical calculations, such as determining the decay constant for radon-222 both in days and seconds.

The text also explains calculating disintegration rates (in Becquerels) using an exponential model with time converted to seconds. This process highlights how different initial quantities affect decay rates over time.

Overall, the discussion integrates arithmetic, calculus, and physics principles to elucidate the exponential nature of radioactive decay, demonstrating calculations both for theoretical understanding and practical applications like measuring radioactivity in becquerels.
