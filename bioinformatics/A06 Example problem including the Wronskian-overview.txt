The text presents a process for solving a system of linear differential equations using matrix methods, specifically focusing on finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

1. **Equations Setup**: The system consists of two coupled first-order differential equations:
   \[
   \frac{dx}{dt} - 2x - 3y = 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dt} - 2x - y = 0
   \]

2. **Matrix Representation**: The system is rewritten in matrix form:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   x' \\
   y'
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   2 & 3 \\
   2 & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   x \\
   y
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

3. **Finding Eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues (\(\lambda\)) are found by solving the characteristic equation obtained from:
   \[
   \det(A - \lambda I) = 0
   \]
   where \( A \) is the coefficient matrix and \( I \) is the identity matrix. This results in a quadratic equation:
   \[
   \lambda^2 - 3\lambda - 4 = 0
   \]
   The solutions (eigenvalues) are \(\lambda_1 = -1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 4\).

4. **Finding Eigenvectors**:
   - For \(\lambda_1 = -1\), the corresponding eigenvector is found by solving:
     \[
     (A + I)\mathbf{v} = 0
     \]
     Resulting in the eigenvector \([-1, 1]\).
   - For \(\lambda_2 = 4\), solve:
     \[
     (A - 4I)\mathbf{v} = 0
     \]
     Yielding the eigenvector \([3, 2]\).

5. **General Solution**: The general solution of the system is a linear combination of solutions corresponding to each eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector:
   \[
   \mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{-t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} e^{4t}
   \]
   where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are arbitrary constants.

6. **Independence Check**: The solutions are checked for linear independence by ensuring their Wronskian (determinant of the matrix formed by placing the solutions as columns) is non-zero, confirming they form a fundamental set of solutions.

The process ensures that the solution space covers all possible behaviors of the system given any initial conditions.
