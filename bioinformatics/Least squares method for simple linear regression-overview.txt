Certainly! It looks like you're performing partial derivatives on a function related to linear regression. Let's go through the steps for deriving the coefficients \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) using calculus.

### Objective Function

The sum of squared errors (SSE) for a simple linear regression model is:

\[ 
S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2 
\]

where \( y_i \) are the observed values, \( x_i \) are the predictor variables, and \( n \) is the number of observations.

### Partial Derivatives

To find the optimal coefficients \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\), we take partial derivatives of \( S \) with respect to each coefficient and set them to zero.

#### Partial Derivative with Respect to \(\beta_0\)

\[ 
\frac{\partial S}{\partial \beta_0} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) 
\]

Setting this derivative to zero:

\[ 
-2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) = 0 
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = n\beta_0 + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i 
\]

Rearranging for \(\beta_0\):

\[ 
\beta_0 = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) 
\]

#### Partial Derivative with Respect to \(\beta_1\)

\[ 
\frac{\partial S}{\partial \beta_1} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)x_i 
\]

Setting this derivative to zero:

\[ 
-2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)x_i = 0 
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i = \beta_0 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 
\]

Substituting the expression for \(\beta_0\) from above:

\[ 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i = \left( \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) \right) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \right) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - \frac{\beta_1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)^2 + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 
\]

Rearranging terms to solve for \(\beta_1\):

\[ 
\beta_1 \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)^2 \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i - \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \right) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i 
\]

Thus, the solution for \(\beta_1\) is:

\[ 
\beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} 
\]

where \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) are the means of \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

### Solving for \(\beta_0\)

Once \(\beta_1\) is determined, substitute it back into the equation for \(\beta_0\):

\[ 
\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x} 
\]

These are the formulas for the least squares estimates of the coefficients in simple linear regression.

The text describes steps involved in deriving equations for the parameters (slope and intercept) of a simple linear regression model. Here's a summary:

1. **Common Factor Extraction**: The expression starts by extracting a common factor of \( \frac{1}{n} \) from both sides of an equation, which simplifies the manipulation process.

2. **Simplification**: By multiplying through by \( n \), terms involving \( n \times 0 \) disappear since they remain zero.

3. **Handling Negatives and Squares**: Care is taken with negatives during multiplication, ensuring that negative signs are correctly applied to maintain the integrity of the expressions (e.g., a negative times a negative becomes positive).

4. **Reorganization of Terms**: The terms involving \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) are rearranged to isolate and solve for \( \beta_1 \), the slope parameter.

5. **Final Equation Derivation**: By moving terms across sides of the equation, taking common factors out where possible (such as \( \beta_1 \)), and dividing both sides by a specific expression, the formula for \( \beta_1 \) is derived.

6. **Resulting Formulas**: The final outcome provides formulas for calculating the y-intercept (\( \beta_0 \)) and slope (\( \beta_1 \)) of the linear regression line:
   - Slope: Derived from \( n \times \sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i \) divided by \( n \times \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2 \).
   - The process emphasizes careful manipulation and understanding of summations, constants, variables, and differentiation rules.

The text underscores the importance of precise algebraic manipulation, especially with signs and terms in summation notation.

Let's continue the analysis from where you left off. You've derived two equations involving \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\):

1. The equation for \(\beta_0\):
   \[
   \beta_0 = \frac{\sum y_i - \beta_1 \sum x_i}{n}
   \]

2. The equation for \(\beta_1\), after simplification:
   \[
   \sum x_i y_i - \beta_0 \sum x_i - \beta_1 \sum x_i^2 = 0
   \]

Now, substitute the expression for \(\beta_0\) into the second equation:

\[
\sum x_i y_i - \left(\frac{\sum y_i - \beta_1 \sum x_i}{n}\right) \sum x_i - \beta_1 \sum x_i^2 = 0
\]

Simplify this expression:

\[
\sum x_i y_i - \frac{\sum y_i \sum x_i}{n} + \frac{\beta_1 (\sum x_i)^2}{n} - \beta_1 \sum x_i^2 = 0
\]

Combine the terms involving \(\beta_1\):

\[
\sum x_i y_i - \frac{\sum y_i \sum x_i}{n} + \beta_1 \left(\frac{(\sum x_i)^2}{n} - \sum x_i^2\right) = 0
\]

Solve for \(\beta_1\):

\[
\beta_1 \left(\frac{(\sum x_i)^2}{n} - \sum x_i^2\right) = \frac{\sum y_i \sum x_i}{n} - \sum x_i y_i
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\beta_1\) is:

\[
\beta_1 = \frac{\frac{\sum y_i \sum x_i}{n} - \sum x_i y_i}{\frac{(\sum x_i)^2}{n} - \sum x_i^2}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\beta_1 = \frac{n \sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i}{n \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}
\]

Now that you have expressions for both \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\), you can use these to find the best-fit line in linear regression. The final equations are:

- For \(\beta_1\):
  \[
  \beta_1 = \frac{n \sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i}{n \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}
  \]

- For \(\beta_0\):
  \[
  \beta_0 = \frac{\sum y_i - \beta_1 \sum x_i}{n}
  \]

These formulas are derived from the method of least squares, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals between observed and predicted values.

The text describes a process of deriving formulas for the intercept (\(\beta_0\)) and slope (\(\beta_1\)) in simple linear regression using summation notation. Here's a summary:

1. **Common Factor and Simplification**: The equation is manipulated by factoring out \( \frac{1}{n} \) as a common factor, allowing the simplification of terms.

2. **Handling Negative Signs**: Careful attention is given to handling negative signs during multiplication to ensure accuracy in algebraic manipulation.

3. **Rearranging Terms**: The goal is to isolate \(\beta_1\) by moving all terms involving it to one side and solving for it, leading to a simplified equation.

4. **Final Equation**: After rearranging, the slope \(\beta_1\) is expressed in terms of summations: 
   \[
   \beta_1 = \frac{n \sum (x_i y_i) - (\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)}{n \sum (x_i^2) - (\sum x_i)^2}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: The process results in formulas for both the intercept and slope of a linear regression line, emphasizing careful algebraic manipulation and understanding of summation notation.

The text highlights the importance of correctly handling algebraic steps and maintaining clarity between different summations to derive these key regression parameters.
