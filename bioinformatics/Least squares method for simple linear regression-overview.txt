Certainly! It looks like you're performing partial derivatives on a function related to linear regression. Let's go through the steps for deriving the coefficients \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) using calculus.

### Objective Function

The sum of squared errors (SSE) for a simple linear regression model is:

\[ 
S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2 
\]

where \( y_i \) are the observed values, \( x_i \) are the predictor variables, and \( n \) is the number of observations.

### Partial Derivatives

To find the optimal coefficients \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\), we take partial derivatives of \( S \) with respect to each coefficient and set them to zero.

#### Partial Derivative with Respect to \(\beta_0\)

\[ 
\frac{\partial S}{\partial \beta_0} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) 
\]

Setting this derivative to zero:

\[ 
-2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) = 0 
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = n\beta_0 + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i 
\]

Rearranging for \(\beta_0\):

\[ 
\beta_0 = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) 
\]

#### Partial Derivative with Respect to \(\beta_1\)

\[ 
\frac{\partial S}{\partial \beta_1} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)x_i 
\]

Setting this derivative to zero:

\[ 
-2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)x_i = 0 
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i = \beta_0 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 
\]

Substituting the expression for \(\beta_0\) from above:

\[ 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i = \left( \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) \right) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \right) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - \frac{\beta_1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)^2 + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 
\]

Rearranging terms to solve for \(\beta_1\):

\[ 
\beta_1 \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)^2 \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i x_i - \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \right) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i 
\]

Thus, the solution for \(\beta_1\) is:

\[ 
\beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} 
\]

where \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) are the means of \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

### Solving for \(\beta_0\)

Once \(\beta_1\) is determined, substitute it back into the equation for \(\beta_0\):

\[ 
\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x} 
\]

These are the formulas for the least squares estimates of the coefficients in simple linear regression.

The text describes steps involved in deriving equations for the parameters (slope and intercept) of a simple linear regression model. Here's a summary:

1. **Common Factor Extraction**: The expression starts by extracting a common factor of \( \frac{1}{n} \) from both sides of an equation, which simplifies the manipulation process.

2. **Simplification**: By multiplying through by \( n \), terms involving \( n \times 0 \) disappear since they remain zero.

3. **Handling Negatives and Squares**: Care is taken with negatives during multiplication, ensuring that negative signs are correctly applied to maintain the integrity of the expressions (e.g., a negative times a negative becomes positive).

4. **Reorganization of Terms**: The terms involving \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) are rearranged to isolate and solve for \( \beta_1 \), the slope parameter.

5. **Final Equation Derivation**: By moving terms across sides of the equation, taking common factors out where possible (such as \( \beta_1 \)), and dividing both sides by a specific expression, the formula for \( \beta_1 \) is derived.

6. **Resulting Formulas**: The final outcome provides formulas for calculating the y-intercept (\( \beta_0 \)) and slope (\( \beta_1 \)) of the linear regression line:
   - Slope: Derived from \( n \times \sum x_i y_i - \sum x_i \sum y_i \) divided by \( n \times \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2 \).
   - The process emphasizes careful manipulation and understanding of summations, constants, variables, and differentiation rules.

The text underscores the importance of precise algebraic manipulation, especially with signs and terms in summation notation.
