This lecture focuses on using Numerical Python (NumPy) for simple calculus, specifically handling polynomials. The session introduces the creation of a polynomial function using NumPy's `poly1d` method. Here are the key points:

1. **Polynomial Definition**: A polynomial is defined as a single-variable function where the independent variable is raised to integer powers. For example, \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \).

2. **Creating Polynomials in Python**: The polynomial coefficients are listed from highest to lowest power of x. Using NumPy's `poly1d`, you can define a polynomial and easily manipulate it.

3. **Operations on Polynomials**:
   - **Multiplication**: By multiplying the polynomial by itself, NumPy generates a new polynomial.
   - **Derivative**: The `deriv` method computes the first derivative of the polynomial.
   - **Integration**: Using the `integ` method, you can integrate the polynomial and manually add the constant of integration.

4. **Practical Application**: These operations allow for quick verification of calculus work, making it a useful tool for checking derivatives and integrals on your computer.
