The text discusses the concept of co-sets (cosets) within group theory. Here's a summary:

1. **Introduction**: The focus is on sets, particularly cosets in the context of groups. A group \( G \) and its subgroup \( H \) are considered.

2. **Relation Definition**: A relation between elements \( A \) and \( B \) in \( G \) is defined such that \( A \) is related to \( B \) if and only if \( A^{-1}B \in H \). This defines a left coset, with the right coset being analogous.

3. **Equivalence Relation**: The text proves that this relation is an equivalence relation by demonstrating:
   - **Reflexive Property**: For any element \( A \) in \( G \), \( A^{-1}A = E \in H \).
   - **Symmetric Property**: If \( A^{-1}B \in H \), then \( B^{-1}A \in H \).
   - **Transitive Property**: If \( A^{-1}B \in H \) and \( B^{-1}C \in H \), then \( A^{-1}C \in H \).

4. **Cosets**: The equivalence classes formed by this relation are called cosets. Specifically, the left coset of \( H \) in \( G \) with representative \( A \) is denoted as \( AH \).

5. **Next Steps**: The text outlines that future discussions will show how these cosets can be expressed as sets and prove their equality by showing mutual subset relations.

The explanation aims to establish the foundational understanding of cosets as equivalence classes within group theory, setting the stage for further exploration into their properties and applications.
