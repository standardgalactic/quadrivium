The text discusses the concept of co-sets (cosets) within group theory. Here's a summary:

1. **Introduction**: The focus is on sets, particularly cosets in the context of groups. A group \( G \) and its subgroup \( H \) are considered.

2. **Relation Definition**: A relation between elements \( A \) and \( B \) in \( G \) is defined such that \( A \) is related to \( B \) if and only if \( A^{-1}B \in H \). This defines a left coset, with the right coset being analogous.

3. **Equivalence Relation**: The text proves that this relation is an equivalence relation by demonstrating:
   - **Reflexive Property**: For any element \( A \) in \( G \), \( A^{-1}A = E \in H \).
   - **Symmetric Property**: If \( A^{-1}B \in H \), then \( B^{-1}A \in H \).
   - **Transitive Property**: If \( A^{-1}B \in H \) and \( B^{-1}C \in H \), then \( A^{-1}C \in H \).

4. **Cosets**: The equivalence classes formed by this relation are called cosets. Specifically, the left coset of \( H \) in \( G \) with representative \( A \) is denoted as \( AH \).

5. **Next Steps**: The text outlines that future discussions will show how these cosets can be expressed as sets and prove their equality by showing mutual subset relations.

The explanation aims to establish the foundational understanding of cosets as equivalence classes within group theory, setting the stage for further exploration into their properties and applications.

The text discusses the concept of co-sets (or cosets) in group theory, focusing primarily on left cosets. Here's a summary:

1. **Definitions and Setup**: 
   - A group \( G \) with elements and a binary operation is defined, along with a subgroup \( H \).
   - The text introduces a relation between elements \( A \) and \( B \) of \( G \), using the condition that \( A^{-1}B \in H \).

2. **Equivalence Relation**:
   - It's claimed that this relation is an equivalence relation, meaning it satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.
     - **Reflexivity**: For any element \( A \) in \( G \), \( A^{-1}A = E \) (the identity element) is in \( H \).
     - **Symmetry**: If \( A^{-1}B \in H \), then \( B^{-1}A \in H \) because inverses within a subgroup remain within the subgroup.
     - **Transitivity**: If \( A^{-1}B \in H \) and \( B^{-1}C \in H \), then \( A^{-1}C \in H \) due to closure and associativity.

3. **Cosets**:
   - The equivalence class of an element \( A \) is called a left coset, denoted as \( HA = \{ x \in G \mid x \sim A \} \).
   - The goal is to show that this set can be expressed as \( \{ Ah \mid h \in H \} \).

4. **Further Exploration**:
   - The text hints at a future discussion on proving the equality of these sets by showing mutual subset inclusion.
   - Right cosets are mentioned but not detailed, indicating they will be explored later.

Overall, the text establishes the foundation for understanding left cosets in group theory and outlines the steps needed to prove their properties.
