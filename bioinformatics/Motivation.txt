A warm welcome once again to this lecture series.
A lecture series designed to help you conduct your own research.
Please read through this page.
Now healthcare science, biological sciences, life sciences,
we are really growing up as far as science is concerned.
I use physics as an example of a heart science.
A science where we have so much knowledge today.
But in healthcare we're digging deeper and it's important for all of us
to understand how to conduct proper research.
Enjoy this lecture series.
