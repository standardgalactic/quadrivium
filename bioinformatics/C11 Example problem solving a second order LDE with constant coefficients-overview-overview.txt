To solve a second-order linear differential equation with complex conjugate roots, we begin by addressing its auxiliary equation: \( m^2 + 4m + 7 = 0 \). Using the quadratic formula:

\[ m = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 28}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{2}. \]

The expression under the square root, \(\sqrt{-12}\), simplifies to \(2\sqrt{3}i\) using the imaginary unit \(i\) where \(i^2 = -1\). Therefore, the roots are:

\[ m_1 = -2 + \sqrt{3}i, \quad m_2 = -2 - \sqrt{3}i. \]

These roots have a real part \(\alpha = -2\) and an imaginary part \(\beta = \sqrt{3}\). The general solution to the differential equation is derived using Euler's formula for complex conjugate roots:

\[ y(x) = e^{\alpha x}(c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x)). \]

Substituting the values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), the solution becomes:

\[ y(x) = e^{-2x}(c_1 \cos(\sqrt{3}x) + c_2 \sin(\sqrt{3}x)). \]

This form represents the solution in terms of real functions, utilizing the complex conjugate nature of the roots.
