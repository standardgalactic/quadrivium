Okay, here we have our multivariable function.
So that's a function in four-dimensional space.
The f of x, y, z equals z minus e to the power x side power y.
This is the point we're interested in, written as a vector,
natural over 3, 3 pi over 2, and negative 3.
And if I just asked for the gradient,
that will be in the positive x direction, positive y direction, positive z direction.
It would be easy.
But now I want the partial derivative, or the directional derivative,
in this direction, written as a vector 1, 2, 2.
Let's remind ourselves of how we're going to do that.
Well, we're going to say the derivative in some unit vector direction
of f of x, not x, but the vector x.
Remember that it's the gradient of f and x dot product with that unit vector.
So first of all, let's do that.
Let's get the gradient of f, gradient of f and x.
So what is that going to be?
So let's do the first derivative with respect to x of this.
Z is a constant, so that's zero.
Sine of y is a constant, so that's going to remain.
And e to the power x, the derivative of that is e to the power x.
It's going to be negative e to the power x sine of y.
Now with respect to y, z is still a constant, that's zero.
Negative e to the power x is a constant.
And, okay, just imagine that.
Imagine I had minus 3 sine of y.
What would be the derivative of that?
It's easy.
It's negative 3 cosine of y.
Okay, so that's all going to stay.
Negative e to the power x cosine of y.
And lastly, with respect to z, x and y are now constants,
so that might as well be z minus 3.
And the partial, the derivative, that would just be 1.
Now, next step, I actually need it at this specific point, P.
So now we're interested in this specific point, P.
Let's get some more chalk.
Interested in that specific point, P.
So the gradient of f at our point is going to be
negative e to the power natural log of 3.
You've got to know what that is.
If I have negative e to the power natural log of 3,
you've got to know that that becomes negative 3.
So that's going to be minus 3.
Oops, times the sine of, what is the sine of 3 pi over 2?
You should know that as well.
It's negative 1.
Come on.
Again, negative 3 for there.
Negative 3.
What's the cosine of 3 pi over 2?
That is 0, 1.
Now, 1 remains.
So what do I have here?
I have 3, 0, 1.
3, 0, 1.
Now, quickly, let's change this into a unit vector.
So unit vector e of this vector b is going to be 1, 2, 2
divided by the square root of 1 squared plus 2 squared plus 2 squared.
That's the square root of 9.
So I'm left here with 1 over square root of 3, comma,
2 over square root of 3, comma, 2 over square root of 3.
So that, and all that is left for me to do is to get the dot product of these two.
So what is that going to be?
So that is the directional derivative of f at the point p in that specific direction,
v that I was given, is going to be 3 times this,
then it's 3 over square root of 3, comma,
3 over square root of 3, plus, remember, it's a dot product,
plus 0 times 2 over square root of 3, 0 times 2, square root of 3, 0,
and 1 times that is plus 1 over square root of 3,
that equals 4 over square root of 3, which is, is that correct?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Square root of 9 is 3.
See how easy it is to make a mistake?
3, 3, 3, 3.
Square root of 9 is 3, not square root of 3.
So it's 1 over 3, 1 over 3,
that is still 3 times 3, that's 1,
plus a third,
1 plus 1 times 2 thirds,
lots of stupid
arithmetical mistakes I should say.
So that's 1 plus 2 over 3,
and that's 5 over 3.
Sorry about that.
Do it for yourself, that's 5 over 3.
Now the next question you might get is,
in what direction at that point,
in what direction at that point,
will we get maximum rate of change,
and in what direction will we get minimum?
So I'm not interested in this anymore.
I want to know in what direction will I get maximum rate of change,
and in what direction minimum.
So maximum, I'm talking about the cosine of 0,
and minimum, I'm talking cosine of pi,
or 180 degrees.
Now, what, how do we do that?
Well, let's just look at what the gradient is at the point.
We do have that.
So the gradient is 3, 0, 1.
3, 0, 1.
So let's just look at what the maximum would be,
in what direction.
Well, I don't know what direction is called ABC,
but I know that that has got to equal 0.
If the dot product is 0,
if what happens when the dot product is 0?
If I have two vectors,
let's say,
let's say,
I just use
an xy coordinate,
you can just remember it very quickly.
If I have that vector
times that vector,
they are at 90 degrees of each other,
this vector would be 0, 1.
This vector would be 1, 0.
If I just made them
one unit long each,
and I get the dot product between those two,
and I'll see that,
I'll see that
the dot product between those two is 0.
So they are 90 degrees,
they are 90 degrees apart.
So,
if I have something that is 90 degrees apart,
this would better give me 0.
So I'm left with 3, 8.
plus c equals 0,
so a equals negative 3rd times c.
a equals negative 3rd times c.
b,
doesn't matter really what b is.
Doesn't matter what b is,
because b is multiplied by 0,
so that can be anything.
And to make life easier for ourselves,
let's choose c to be 1.
If c equals 1,
then a equals negative 1 3rd.
So if I have negative 1 3rd,
comma,
whatever,
let's keep it 0,
comma, 1.
If I look in that direction,
if I multiply these two with each other,
I'm going to get 0.
in other words,
this vector points perpendicularly away from the gradient,
the gradient that I have there.
What I'd like to do is,
if I have time,
I might do one more problem with these,
so you can understand where this minimum and maximum,
minimum and maximum values come in.
If we look at the norm,
though,
let me just do that now.
If we look at the norm of the gradient of f at p,
what are we going to get?
Well,
remember that it's the gradient of f at p,
3, 0, 1.
The norm of that equals square root of 10.
3 times 3 is 9,
plus 1 is 10,
square root of 10.
So it's square root of 10.
And remember we said that it is this norm times the cosine of the angle.
So the maximum we're going to get at a cosine of,
where can I do that?
Remember,
we're going to have this,
the gradient of f at p,
times the cosine of theta.
Now,
as I said,
the maximum is going to be where the angle is 0,
and if the angle is 0,
that's the cosine of 1.
So the maximum value,
the maximum rate of change,
that you're ever going to get,
at that specific point p,
is going to be the square root of 10,
and the minimum that you're ever going to get.
The minimum that you're ever going to get,
obviously,
when theta equals 180 degrees of pi,
and that's going to be negative square root of 10.
So the maximum rate of change,
at that specific point,
in this function of r,
is the square root of 10,
and the minimum is going to be negative,
the square root of 10.
That's because,
cosine goes from positive 1 to negative 1.
As promised in the previous video,
I just want another example to show you where this cosine comes in,
where we use the norm of the gradient.
So let's just reiterate,
if I want the partial derivative,
in a certain direction,
of f at a certain point,
that is going to be the gradient,
of f at that certain point,
dot product,
of the unit vector in the direction I'm interested in.
So let's look at this.
Here we have a multivariable equation.
f of x and y equals x squared plus y squared,
and we've set that to a third axis here, z.
So it's easy to remember,
if I have two variables,
that means I've got a three-dimensional curve,
and it's this three-dimensional parabola.
Three-dimensional parabola.
So if we just look at di z, di y,
di z, di y,
or di f by y,
it doesn't matter what we write.
At a certain point,
if I just look at that,
what I'm doing is,
I'm keeping x constant,
no matter what.
Here we say, for instance,
that now the x-axis comes towards you,
and I've chosen x equals 0,
it doesn't matter what I choose it.
I'm going to get this curve in the yz plane.
I'm going to get this curve in the yz plane,
and at a certain point,
there's going to be a tangent at any point,
and that's first-year calculators.
And it will have a certain value at that point.
It will have a certain value at that point.
Now, what we are saying
with this issue of the maximum and minimum,
remember, this is going to equal
the norm of the gradient at this point
times the cosine of the angle,
and that's the angle between
the direction I'm interested in,
which will now not be the y-axis,
not z with respect to y in any direction.
Okay?
If I use that direction as a vector,
this as this y-axis here is a vector,
then the angle between the gradient
at that point and that
gives me the same value.
I'll get the same answer as I get there
if I knew what the angle was between them.
And all we now say is if I make,
if I choose a direction which has,
if I choose my direction
exactly in this direction,
so the angle between the gradient,
the angle between the gradient
and the direction in which I'm going,
if I want that to be maximized,
I choose the angle between them to be zero
because the cosine of zero is one,
and one times this will give me
the maximum value.
If I choose directly,
so my maximum,
if I start tripling in this direction now,
I get a maximum rate of increase
in first year calculus.
If I move in this direction,
I'm going to get a massive,
the maximum decrease.
Okay, so because we're close,
180 degrees,
I'm moving that way,
now I'm moving 180 degrees
in the other direction,
I'm going to get zero.
So the same goes for multivariable calculus.
Okay, so that's going to give me
the maximum and the minimum value.
Okay, but just think of a three-dimensional spot.
Just think of a three-dimensional,
choose any spot on the circumference.
Say I choose a day with my tangent
now lying there.
In which direction must I move
to get zero?
To get zero change.
I want no change.
And it's difficult to extrapolate that
from there to here,
but if, so for instance,
I moved in this direction,
if I moved in this direction,
that value doesn't change.
If I move in this direction,
if I moved in this direction,
there's a rate of change.
If I moved in that direction,
there's a rate of change.
But if I move perpendicularly
away from this tangent point there,
on this little curve,
there's actually,
there's no change.
And that is what I meant by,
in the previous video,
where we looked at,
say for instance,
my point was 3,1,
and I did a dot product of A,B,
that's got to be zero.
That's what I meant by,
that'll be 90 degrees.
It comes in with this 90 degrees.
If I could move in a certain specific direction,
I'm going to get no rate of change.
And so this was going to be,
in this example,
3A plus B equals zero.
So 3A equals negative B,
and A equals negative a third B.
So whatever I choose,
if I choose B to be one,
that means A is negative a third,
negative a third comma one.
That will be a direction,
because if I plug this in there now,
and I do this dot product,
I'm going to get,
I'm going to get a zero.
So that would then be the direction,
at this point,
that I,
I just chose an arbitrary point,
doesn't matter,
it's not,
doesn't,
it really got a third in there.
It actually does,
but it doesn't matter.
If I have a point,
then I want to know how to get,
what direction to go,
to get low,
to get no change.
Okay,
if they want the maximum,
the question is,
what direction should I move,
for max,
or what would be the maximum rate of change,
in this unit vector direction of mine,
to state the norm of this gradient,
at that point,
make this zero degrees,
so that becomes one,
that gives you the maximum,
make this 180 degrees,
that gives you negative one,
so it's just going to be,
the answer is just going to be positive whatever,
and negative whatever,
that's the minimum and maximum rate of change,
in this,
in this direction,
and then if you want to get a direction,
in which,
at this exact same point,
in which there'll be no rate of change,
just put another vector there,
do the,
do the,
do the,
do the dot product,
it works well,
if you just have the two,
it works well,
if you just have the two,
and that will give you a rate of,
a direction that you need to go,
and if you go along that vector,
there's going to be no rate of change.
