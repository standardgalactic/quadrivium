The text provides a comprehensive approach to solving a second-order homogeneous differential equation given by:

\[ d^2x + 2dx + 10x = 0. \]

### Steps in Solving the Differential Equation

1. **Characteristic Equation**: 
   - The auxiliary (characteristic) equation derived from the differential equation is:
     \[ m^2 + 2m + 10 = 0. \]
   - It has complex roots: \( m = -1 \pm 3i \).

2. **General Solution**:
   - With these roots, the general solution of the differential equation is expressed as:
     \[ x(t) = e^{-t}(c_1 \cos(3t) + c_2 \sin(3t)). \]

3. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Using initial conditions \( x(0) = -2 \), we find \( c_1 = -2 \).
   - Differentiating the solution to find \( x'(t) \), and using \( x'(0) = 0 \), results in finding \( c_2 = -\frac{2}{3} \).

4. **Particular Solution**:
   - The particular solution becomes:
     \[ x(t) = -2 e^{-t} \cos(3t) - \frac{2}{3} e^{-t} \sin(3t). \]

### Alternate Form of the Solution

5. **Conversion to \( A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \)**:
   - The expression is converted into an alternate form, \( A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \), where:
     \[ A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3}. \]
   - The phase angle \(\phi\) is determined by the arctangent of \( \frac{c_2}{c_1} \).

6. **Phase Angle Calculation**:
   - The angle \(\phi\) accounts for both the quadrant in which the point \((-2, -\frac{2}{3})\) lies and results in:
     \[ \phi = \pi + \arcsin\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}\right) \approx 4.391. \]

7. **Final Function**:
   - The solution is then expressed as:
     \[ x(t) = \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{3} \sin(3t + 4.391). \]
   - This form reflects an oscillatory motion, consistent with the behavior of systems described by such differential equations.

In summary, this text outlines solving a second-order differential equation using characteristic equations and initial conditions to find specific coefficients in the general solution. It also demonstrates converting the solution into a sinusoidal form for ease of interpretation in physical contexts involving oscillations.
