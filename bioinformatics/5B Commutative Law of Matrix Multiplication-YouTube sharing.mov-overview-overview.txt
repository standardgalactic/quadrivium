The text outlines why matrix multiplication is generally non-commutative. It provides three examples:

1. **Non-Commutativity Example**: For matrices A (2x3) and B (3x4), the product AB results in a 2x4 matrix, but BA isn't defined since B's columns (4) don't match A's rows (2).

2. **Different Sizes Example**: With matrices A (2x3) and B (3x2), both products AB (2x2) and BA (3x3) are defined but have different dimensions.

3. **Same Size, Different Values Example**: For square matrices A and B of size 2x2, while both AB and BA are defined with the same 2x2 dimensions, their values can differ.

The text concludes that matrix multiplication does not satisfy the commutative property: \(AB \neq BA\).
