The text outlines the process of evaluating a line integral over a curve parametrized by \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (5\cos(t), 5\sin(t)) \) with parameter \( t \) ranging from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). The function being integrated is \( f(x, y) = 2xy \).

1. **Parametrization and Norm Calculation**:
   - The curve is already parametrized as \( x(t) = 5\cos(t) \) and \( y(t) = 5\sin(t) \).
   - To find the differential arc length \( ds \), compute \( \mathbf{r}'(t) = (-5\sin(t), 5\cos(t)) \).
   - The norm of \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{(-5\sin(t))^2 + (5\cos(t))^2} = \sqrt{25(\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t))} = 5
     \]
   - Thus, \( ds = 5 \, dt \).

2. **Function Substitution**:
   - Substitute the parametrization into \( f(x, y) = 2xy \):
     \[
     f(5\cos(t), 5\sin(t)) = 2 \times 5\cos(t) \times 5\sin(t) = 50\cos(t)\sin(t)
     \]

3. **Integral Setup**:
   - The line integral becomes:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{\pi/4} 50\cos(t)\sin(t) \cdot 5 \, dt = 250 \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \cos(t)\sin(t) \, dt
     \]

4. **Solving the Integral**:
   - Use substitution: let \( u = \sin(t) \), then \( du = \cos(t) \, dt \).
   - Change limits: when \( t = 0 \), \( u = 0 \); when \( t = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
   - The integral becomes:
     \[
     250 \int_{0}^{1/\sqrt{2}} u \, du
     \]
   - Evaluate the integral:
     \[
     250 \left[ \frac{u^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{1/\sqrt{2}} = 250 \left( \frac{(1/\sqrt{2})^2}{2} - 0 \right) = 250 \times \frac{1/2}{2} = 250 \times \frac{1}{4} = 62.5
     \]

Thus, the value of the line integral is \( 62.5 \).

This text provides an example of computing a line integral of a scalar field along a parametrized curve in space. The scalar field is given by \( f(x, y) = 2xy \), and the curve is parameterized as \( (x(t), y(t)) = (5\cos t, 5\sin t) \) with \( t \) ranging from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). 

To compute the line integral of the scalar field along this curve, we need to evaluate:

\[ \int_C f(x, y) \, ds \]

where \( ds \) is expressed in terms of the parameterization as:

\[ ds = \| \mathbf{r}'(t) \| \, dt \]

The vector function for the curve is \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (5\cos t, 5\sin t) \), and its derivative with respect to \( t \) is:

\[ \mathbf{r}'(t) = (-5\sin t, 5\cos t) \]

The norm of this derivative vector is calculated as follows:

\[ \| \mathbf{r}'(t) \| = \sqrt{(-5\sin t)^2 + (5\cos t)^2} = \sqrt{25(\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t)} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]

Thus, \( ds = 5 \, dt \).

Substituting the parameterization into the function \( f(x, y) = 2xy \), we get:

\[ f(5\cos t, 5\sin t) = 2 \times (5\cos t) \times (5\sin t) = 50\cos t \sin t \]

The line integral becomes:

\[ \int_0^{\pi/4} 50 \cos t \sin t \cdot 5 \, dt = 250 \int_0^{\pi/4} \cos t \sin t \, dt \]

To solve the integral \( \int \cos t \sin t \, dt \), we use a substitution method. Let \( u = \sin t \), then \( du = \cos t \, dt \). The limits of integration change accordingly: when \( t = 0 \), \( u = 0 \); and when \( t = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

The integral becomes:

\[ 250 \int_0^{1/\sqrt{2}} u \, du \]

This evaluates to:

\[ 250 \left[ \frac{u^2}{2} \right]_0^{1/\sqrt{2}} = 250 \left( \frac{(1/\sqrt{2})^2}{2} - 0 \right) = 250 \times \frac{1/2}{2} = 250 \times \frac{1}{4} = 62.5 \]

Thus, the value of the line integral is \( 62.5 \).
