The text discusses solving a specific type of differential equation: a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The problem presented involves finding the solution given initial conditions \( y(0) = -1 \) and \( y'(0) = 2 \).

To solve this, we start by forming an auxiliary (or characteristic) equation based on the differential equation:

\[ 4m^2 + 4m + 17 = 0. \]

Solving this quadratic yields complex conjugate roots: 

\[ m_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + 2i, \quad m_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - 2i. \]

These roots indicate a solution of the form:

\[ y(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}(c_1 \cos(2x) + c_2 \sin(2x)). \]

Using initial conditions to find \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \):

- From \( y(0) = -1 \), we determine \( c_1 = -1 \).
- Differentiating \( y(x) \) and using \( y'(0) = 2 \) allows us to solve for \( c_2 = \frac{3}{4} \).

Thus, the specific solution is:

\[ y(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}(-\cos(2x) + \frac{3}{4}\sin(2x)). \]

This function represents a damped oscillation due to the exponential decay term \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}x} \). As \( x \to \infty \), the amplitude of the oscillation diminishes, and \( y(x) \to 0 \).

The text emphasizes understanding how such differential equations model real-world damped oscillations, which are common in physics and engineering contexts.
