The text discusses solving a specific type of differential equation: a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The problem presented involves finding the solution given initial conditions \( y(0) = -1 \) and \( y'(0) = 2 \).

To solve this, we start by forming an auxiliary (or characteristic) equation based on the differential equation:

\[ 4m^2 + 4m + 17 = 0. \]

Solving this quadratic yields complex conjugate roots: 

\[ m_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + 2i, \quad m_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - 2i. \]

These roots indicate a solution of the form:

\[ y(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}(c_1 \cos(2x) + c_2 \sin(2x)). \]

Using initial conditions to find \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \):

- From \( y(0) = -1 \), we determine \( c_1 = -1 \).
- Differentiating \( y(x) \) and using \( y'(0) = 2 \) allows us to solve for \( c_2 = \frac{3}{4} \).

Thus, the specific solution is:

\[ y(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}(-\cos(2x) + \frac{3}{4}\sin(2x)). \]

This function represents a damped oscillation due to the exponential decay term \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}x} \). As \( x \to \infty \), the amplitude of the oscillation diminishes, and \( y(x) \to 0 \).

The text emphasizes understanding how such differential equations model real-world damped oscillations, which are common in physics and engineering contexts.

The text discusses solving a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients using the method of characteristic equations. The problem is an initial value problem with given conditions \( y(0) = -1 \) and \( y'(0) = 2 \).

The differential equation leads to a characteristic quadratic equation: \( 4m^2 + 4m + 17 = 0 \). Solving this using the quadratic formula, we find complex conjugate roots \( m_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + 2i \) and \( m_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - 2i \), where \( \alpha = -\frac{1}{2} \) and \( \beta = 2 \).

The general solution for the differential equation is expressed as:
\[ y(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}(c_1 \cos(2x) + c_2 \sin(2x)) \]

Using the initial conditions, we substitute into the general solution to solve for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \):
- From \( y(0) = -1 \), it follows that \( c_1 = -1 \).
- Differentiating \( y(x) \) and using \( y'(0) = 2 \) allows solving for \( c_2 \). The calculation yields \( c_2 = \frac{3}{4} \).

Thus, the specific solution to the initial value problem is:
\[ y(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}(-\cos(2x) + \frac{3}{4}\sin(2x)) \]

This solution represents a damped oscillation, where the amplitude decreases exponentially as \( x \to \infty \), indicating that the system eventually stabilizes. The text emphasizes understanding such solutions for real-world applications involving damped oscillations.
