The text describes an example problem involving a protein that exists in two states, A and B, which can transform into each other. At equilibrium, the ratio of concentrations of state B to state A becomes constant, known as the equilibrium constant (\(K_{\text{eq}}\)). The free energy change (\(\Delta G^\circ\)) of this system at equilibrium is related to two biological equations: one involving temperature and the universal gas constant \(R\) with the natural log of the equilibrium coefficient, and another involving changes in enthalpy (\(\Delta H^\circ\)) and entropy (\(\Delta S^\circ\)). These can be equated and manipulated algebraically.

To determine \(\Delta H^\circ\) and \(\Delta S^\circ\), an experiment is conducted at various temperatures to measure \(K_{\text{eq}}\). By plotting the natural log of \(K_{\text{eq}}\) against \(1/T\) (inverse temperature), a straight line is obtained, which follows the linear equation \(Y = MX + C\). Here, \(M\) represents \(-\Delta H^\circ/R\) and \(C\) represents \(\Delta S^\circ/R\). By analyzing this graph, one can easily determine both \(\Delta H^\circ\) and \(\Delta S^\circ\), solving the problem of determining these thermodynamic parameters through experimental data and mathematical modeling.
