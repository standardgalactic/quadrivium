The text describes an example problem involving a protein that exists in two states, A and B, which can transform into each other. At equilibrium, the ratio of concentrations of state B to state A becomes constant, known as the equilibrium constant (\(K_{\text{eq}}\)). The free energy change (\(\Delta G^\circ\)) of this system at equilibrium is related to two biological equations: one involving temperature and the universal gas constant \(R\) with the natural log of the equilibrium coefficient, and another involving changes in enthalpy (\(\Delta H^\circ\)) and entropy (\(\Delta S^\circ\)). These can be equated and manipulated algebraically.

To determine \(\Delta H^\circ\) and \(\Delta S^\circ\), an experiment is conducted at various temperatures to measure \(K_{\text{eq}}\). By plotting the natural log of \(K_{\text{eq}}\) against \(1/T\) (inverse temperature), a straight line is obtained, which follows the linear equation \(Y = MX + C\). Here, \(M\) represents \(-\Delta H^\circ/R\) and \(C\) represents \(\Delta S^\circ/R\). By analyzing this graph, one can easily determine both \(\Delta H^\circ\) and \(\Delta S^\circ\), solving the problem of determining these thermodynamic parameters through experimental data and mathematical modeling.

The text describes an experiment involving the transformation of a protein between two states, A and B, which reach equilibrium at a specific temperature. At equilibrium, the ratio of concentrations of state B to state A remains constant, defined as the equilibrium constant (K_eq). The free energy change (\(\Delta G^\circ\)) for this system can be expressed in terms of enthalpy (\(\Delta H^\circ\)), entropy (\(\Delta S^\circ\)), temperature, and the universal gas constant (R).

Two equations represent \(\Delta G^\circ\): 
1. \(-RT \ln K_{eq}\) 
2. \(\Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ\)

By equating these expressions and manipulating algebraically, we derive a linear relationship between the natural logarithm of \(K_{eq}\) and \(1/T\) (temperature in Kelvin). This results in a straight line where the slope (\(M\)) is \(-\Delta H^\circ/R\) and the y-intercept (\(C\)) corresponds to \(\Delta S^\circ/R\).

Through experimental measurements of \(K_{eq}\) at various temperatures, one can plot \(\ln K_{eq}\) against \(1/T\). The resulting straight-line graph allows for easy determination of the slope and intercept, from which \(\Delta H^\circ\) (change in enthalpy) and \(\Delta S^\circ\) (change in entropy) can be calculated. This method demonstrates how a simple experiment and mathematical model can solve for unknown thermodynamic parameters.
