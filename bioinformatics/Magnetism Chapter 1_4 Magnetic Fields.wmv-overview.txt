Let's break down and solve each part of your query step-by-step.

### Part 1: Calculating Electric Field and Potential Difference

#### Given:
- Block dimensions: \(5 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m}\) in the x, y, z directions.
- Drift velocity (\(v\)): \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) in the i direction (x-direction).
- Magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)): \(30 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T}\) in the j direction (y-direction).

#### Objective:
1. Find the electric field inside the block.
2. Determine the electric potential difference across the block.

#### Solution:

**Step 1: Electric Field Calculation**

At equilibrium, the force due to the magnetic field is balanced by the force due to the electric field:

\[
q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) = -q\mathbf{E}
\]

Since \(q\) cancels out, we have:

\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = -\mathbf{E}
\]

Given:
- \(\mathbf{v} = 20 \, \hat{i} \, \text{m/s}\)
- \(\mathbf{B} = 30 \times 10^{-3} \, \hat{j} \, \text{T}\)

Calculate the cross product:

\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
20 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 30 \times 10^{-3} & 0
\end{vmatrix}
= (20)(30 \times 10^{-3})(\hat{k}) - (0) = 0.6 \, \hat{k} \, \text{V/m}
\]

Thus, the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{E} = -0.6 \, \hat{k} \, \text{V/m}
\]

This indicates an electric field of \(0.6 \, \text{V/m}\) in the negative z-direction.

**Step 2: Electric Potential Difference Calculation**

The potential difference (\(V\)) across the block is given by:

\[
V = E \cdot d
\]

Where:
- \(E = 0.6 \, \text{V/m}\)
- \(d = 2 \, \text{m}\) (z-direction)

Thus:

\[
V = 0.6 \times 2 = 1.2 \, \text{V}
\]

The potential difference is \(1.2 \, \text{V}\), with the front face being positive relative to the back face.

### Part 2: Potential Difference in a Metal Strip

#### Given:
- Thickness (\(d\)): \(150 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\)
- Width (\(w\)): \(4.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}\)
- Magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)): \(0.65 \, \text{T}\)
- Current (\(I\)): \(23 \, \text{A}\)
- Number of charge carriers per unit volume (\(n\)): Known
- Charge of an electron (\(e\)): \(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)

#### Objective:
Calculate the potential difference across the width of the strip.

**Solution:**

The drift velocity (\(v_d\)) is given by:

\[
I = n e A v_d
\]

Where \(A = w \times d\) is the cross-sectional area. Solving for \(v_d\):

\[
v_d = \frac{I}{n e w d}
\]

The electric field (\(E\)) is related to the potential difference (\(V\)) by:

\[
E = \frac{V}{w}
\]

And from the Hall effect, we have:

\[
E = v_d B
\]

Thus:

\[
v_d B = \frac{V}{w}
\]

Solving for \(V\):

\[
V = v_d B w = \left(\frac{I}{n e w d}\right) B w
\]

Substitute the known values to find \(V\).

### Conclusion

1. **Electric Field and Potential Difference in Block:**
   - Electric field: \(0.6 \, \text{V/m}\) in the negative z-direction.
   - Potential difference: \(1.2 \, \text{V}\).

2. **Potential Difference in Metal Strip:**
   - Use the formula derived to calculate \(V\) with given values for \(I\), \(n\), \(e\), \(B\), \(w\), and \(d\).

Let's break down and solve each of these physics problems related to electromagnetism.

### Problem 1: Electric Field Inside a Moving Block

**Given:**
- Dimensions: \(5 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m}\) (x, y, z direction)
- Drift velocity of conduction electrons: \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) in the x-direction
- Magnetic field: \(30 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T}\) in the j (y) direction

**Find:**
- Electric field inside the block
- Electric potential difference across the block and which faces are involved

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the velocity vector (\(\mathbf{v}\)):**
   \[
   \mathbf{v} = 20 \, \hat{\mathbf{i}} \, \text{m/s}
   \]

2. **Determine the magnetic field vector (\(\mathbf{B}\)):**
   \[
   \mathbf{B} = 30 \times 10^{-3} \, \hat{\mathbf{j}} \, \text{T}
   \]

3. **Calculate the electric field (\(\mathbf{E}\)) using \(\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\):**
   \[
   \mathbf{E} = -(20 \, \hat{\mathbf{i}}) \times (30 \times 10^{-3} \, \hat{\mathbf{j}})
   \]

4. **Perform the cross product:**
   - \( \hat{\mathbf{i}} \times \hat{\mathbf{j}} = \hat{\mathbf{k}} \)
   - So:
     \[
     \mathbf{E} = -(20)(30 \times 10^{-3}) \, \hat{\mathbf{k}}
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     \mathbf{E} = -0.6 \, \hat{\mathbf{k}} \, \text{V/m}
     \]

5. **Determine the electric potential difference (\(V\)):**
   - Use \( V = E \cdot d \)
   - Here, \(d\) is along the z-direction (thickness of 2 m):
     \[
     V = 0.6 \times 2 = 1.2 \, \text{V}
     \]

**Conclusion:**
- The electric field inside the block is \(0.60 \, \text{V/m}\) in the negative z-direction (\(-\hat{\mathbf{k}}\)).
- The potential difference across the block (z-faces) is \(1.2 \, \text{V}\), with the front face being positive relative to the back.

### Problem 2: Potential Difference Across a Metal Strip

**Given:**
- Thickness (\(d_h\)): \(150 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\)
- Width (\(w\)): \(4.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}\)
- Magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)): \(0.65 \, \text{T}\) in the k direction
- Current (\(I\)): \(23 \, \text{A}\)

**Find:**
- Potential difference across the width of the strip

**Solution:**

1. **Drift velocity (\(v_d\)) formula:**
   - \( v_d = \frac{I}{n e A} \)
   - Area \( A = d_h \times w \)

2. **Electric field (\(\mathbf{E}\)) and potential difference (\(V\)):**
   - Use \( V = E \cdot w \) where \( E = v_d B \)
   - Substitute drift velocity: 
     \[
     E = \frac{IB}{n e d_h}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     V = \frac{IBw}{n e d_h}
     \]

3. **Given values:**
   - \( n \) (number of charge carriers per unit volume), and \( e \) (charge of an electron) need to be known or given for exact calculation.

4. **Substitute known values and solve if \( n \) is provided.**

**Conclusion:**
- The potential difference across the width can be calculated using the formula above, once all parameters are known. 

These solutions provide a structured approach to solving electromagnetism problems involving moving conductors in magnetic fields.
