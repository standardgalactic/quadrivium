Let's break down and solve each part of your query step-by-step.

### Part 1: Calculating Electric Field and Potential Difference

#### Given:
- Block dimensions: \(5 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m} \times 2 \, \text{m}\) in the x, y, z directions.
- Drift velocity (\(v\)): \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) in the i direction (x-direction).
- Magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)): \(30 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T}\) in the j direction (y-direction).

#### Objective:
1. Find the electric field inside the block.
2. Determine the electric potential difference across the block.

#### Solution:

**Step 1: Electric Field Calculation**

At equilibrium, the force due to the magnetic field is balanced by the force due to the electric field:

\[
q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) = -q\mathbf{E}
\]

Since \(q\) cancels out, we have:

\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = -\mathbf{E}
\]

Given:
- \(\mathbf{v} = 20 \, \hat{i} \, \text{m/s}\)
- \(\mathbf{B} = 30 \times 10^{-3} \, \hat{j} \, \text{T}\)

Calculate the cross product:

\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
20 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 30 \times 10^{-3} & 0
\end{vmatrix}
= (20)(30 \times 10^{-3})(\hat{k}) - (0) = 0.6 \, \hat{k} \, \text{V/m}
\]

Thus, the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{E} = -0.6 \, \hat{k} \, \text{V/m}
\]

This indicates an electric field of \(0.6 \, \text{V/m}\) in the negative z-direction.

**Step 2: Electric Potential Difference Calculation**

The potential difference (\(V\)) across the block is given by:

\[
V = E \cdot d
\]

Where:
- \(E = 0.6 \, \text{V/m}\)
- \(d = 2 \, \text{m}\) (z-direction)

Thus:

\[
V = 0.6 \times 2 = 1.2 \, \text{V}
\]

The potential difference is \(1.2 \, \text{V}\), with the front face being positive relative to the back face.

### Part 2: Potential Difference in a Metal Strip

#### Given:
- Thickness (\(d\)): \(150 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\)
- Width (\(w\)): \(4.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}\)
- Magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)): \(0.65 \, \text{T}\)
- Current (\(I\)): \(23 \, \text{A}\)
- Number of charge carriers per unit volume (\(n\)): Known
- Charge of an electron (\(e\)): \(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)

#### Objective:
Calculate the potential difference across the width of the strip.

**Solution:**

The drift velocity (\(v_d\)) is given by:

\[
I = n e A v_d
\]

Where \(A = w \times d\) is the cross-sectional area. Solving for \(v_d\):

\[
v_d = \frac{I}{n e w d}
\]

The electric field (\(E\)) is related to the potential difference (\(V\)) by:

\[
E = \frac{V}{w}
\]

And from the Hall effect, we have:

\[
E = v_d B
\]

Thus:

\[
v_d B = \frac{V}{w}
\]

Solving for \(V\):

\[
V = v_d B w = \left(\frac{I}{n e w d}\right) B w
\]

Substitute the known values to find \(V\).

### Conclusion

1. **Electric Field and Potential Difference in Block:**
   - Electric field: \(0.6 \, \text{V/m}\) in the negative z-direction.
   - Potential difference: \(1.2 \, \text{V}\).

2. **Potential Difference in Metal Strip:**
   - Use the formula derived to calculate \(V\) with given values for \(I\), \(n\), \(e\), \(B\), \(w\), and \(d\).
