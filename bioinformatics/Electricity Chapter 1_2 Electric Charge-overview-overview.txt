In this discussion about electric charges and static equilibrium, we examine three charged particles: Particle 1 with a positive charge of \(8q\), fixed at a point; Particle 2 with a negative charge of \(-2q\) positioned a distance \(L\) away from Particle 1. The goal is to determine where to place a positively charged proton such that it experiences no net force, achieving static equilibrium.

The potential positions for the proton are analyzed as follows:

1. **To the left of Particle 1**: The proton would face strong repulsion from the large positive charge of \(8q\) and weak attraction from \(-2q\), resulting in a net force to the right. Static equilibrium is not possible here.

2. **Between Particles 1 and 2**: The proton is repelled by Particle 1 and attracted towards Particle 2. However, due to the larger charge \(8q\) on Particle 1 compared to \(-2q\) on Particle 2, a net force always points toward Particle 1, preventing equilibrium.

3. **To the right of Particle 2**: Here, the forces from both particles can potentially balance each other out. By applying Coulomb's law and solving for equilibrium, it is determined that placing the proton at \(x = 2L\) from Particle 1 (or beyond Particle 2) results in static equilibrium.

The discussion concludes with a mention of another scenario involving two identically charged particles separated by a known distance, where the focus shifts to analyzing the acceleration of one particle due to electrostatic force. Further exploration of this scenario is suggested for subsequent content.
