The text primarily focuses on two vector-related tasks. 

1. **Calculating the Norm of Vector W**: 
   - Given a vector \( \mathbf{W} = (3, 6, -4) \), its norm is calculated using the formula for magnitude: 
     \[
     \| \mathbf{W} \| = \sqrt{3^2 + 6^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 36 + 16} = \sqrt{61}
     \]
   - The unit vector in the direction of \( \mathbf{W} \) is then found by dividing each component by the norm:
     \[
     \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{61}}, \frac{6}{\sqrt{61}}, \frac{-4}{\sqrt{61}}\right)
     \]
   - The norm of this unit vector is confirmed to be 1.

2. **Solving for Scalar \( L \)**:
   - Given vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), and scalar \( k = 3 \), the equations involving scalars are set up as follows:
     - \( k\mathbf{u} + L\mathbf{v} = (6, 18, -21) + (-L, -L, 8L) \)
   - Solving for \( L \):
     - From the first component: \( 6 - L = 2 \), leading to \( L = 4 \).
     - Verification with other components confirms that \( L = 4 \).

These tasks illustrate vector normalization and solving scalar equations involving vectors.
