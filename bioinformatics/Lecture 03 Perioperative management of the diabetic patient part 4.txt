Now let's move on to the protocol at your institution. It's going to be different for
everyone but there's some baseline research and experience that went into that and some of that
you have to understand. Now remember two-thirds of all patients that you will see will be on some
form of oral hypoglycemic. Now there are quite a few of them I just want to mention two groups
the biguanides of which we have metformin. Now those are sensitizers so they'll sensitize
the body tissues to insulin and they also decrease glucose production. They have a very low risk of
causing hypoglycemia but they do have a risk of causing lactic acidosis in sensitive patients.
For us the surgeons we might be worried about the patients with renal insufficiency and sending them
to get contrast at radiology. The sulfonylureas like the second generation glipizide now these
are secretagogues so they're going to stimulate the release of insulin in those patients that can
still produce a bit of insulin. They do have a high risk of causing hypoglycemia so watch out for
them and their side effect really is weight gain. Now a quarter of your patients will be on insulin
so those will be the type 1s they require insulin but many type 2 diabetics are also on insulin.
Now when a patient is on an insulin regime it's really trying to mimic the normal physiology so
they'll get a type of insulin just as a baseline. You have a normal basal metabolic rate even if
you don't eat or do much and that requires some throughput of glucose metabolism so there's this
basal rate then there's an increased rate of insulin just to take care of the carbohydrate intake that
follows meals and to deal with that carbohydrate load and there's also from time to time we also
need a bit of rescue therapy. It just might be that the patient ate something abnormal or they suffer
from a bit of infection called flu or cellulitis or something like that. So the baseline insulin you
really can do that as two types. In first world setting many patients have subcutaneous continuous infusion
pumps but for the rest of us there's this long-acting peakless insulin so they'll just be a slow long
release and there won't be any peaks and really 50 percent of the daily insulin dose should be of this
type. Now for your type 2 diabetics on the oral medication and the insulin most of them require a
bit of higher dose of insulin because remember they are insulin resistant and they together with the
other type 1s get a mixed dose so they'll get a long-acting and intermediate-acting short and
rapid-acting insulin made up as a mixture and you've got to watch out for the for for the different
types that they are. So what can you suggest to patients or what is usually in these algorithms at
your institution? Let's start with a day prior to surgery and on that day they just take their normal
dosing. Nothing happens on the day before. There are a few exceptions though watch out for those.
If patients do take an evening dose remember some patients will just take one day a dose but most
people will be on at least twice a day dose. For those patients that then take an evening dose and
do suffer from nocturnal hypoglycemia in other words they do get have to get up and eat something
during the during the middle of the night they can decrease the evening dose they should actually
decrease that evening dose slightly by about say a fifth to a third somewhere in that range just
decrease that evening dose. If they are type 2 and they are only on peakless insulin that baseline
insulin that they take long-acting insulin so type 2 oral and only on long-acting they can emit
any kind of evening dose that they take they can emit any kind of evening dose. The patients type 2 so
then oral and some mixture of insulins they can still take that evening dose because they will get that
peak before they actually go to bed so they can still take that that evening dose.
Evening mix any type of evening mix but the patient or patient also suffers from hypoglycemia if their
breakfast is delayed which is going to happen they're going to have to emit breakfast they can also decrease
their evening mix dose so watch out for these patients. Now we get to the operative day now no oral or
non-insulin drugs should be taken on the day of surgery so that gets admitted now remember we try to operate
diabetics in the morning so they're not going to have any breakfast. We also advise patients to bring
along their own medication and now the surgical anesthetic and nursing staff can actually confirm
what the patient's on and it confuses any dosing issues that the patient's not sure of or some trade name
problems it really helps to prevent that confusion. So if it's a very short procedure they you can just
omit all their morning doses they go for the procedure the glucose is monitored every hour and they can just
eat afterwards. Now in any longer procedure or there's going to be a long wait a long delay either in
getting to the surgery or for them to be able to start eating post-operative always consider giving
these patients intravenous glucose. A diabetic also needs glucose so they're going to get a glucose
containing intravenous line. Now also with the longer procedures later on in the morning
van et al worked out a beautifully easy formula pure algebraic formula they easy to do published in 2009
well worth a read. So it works the following way so you take the normal interval that the patient takes
their regular dose at some people as i mentioned take insulin once a day so their dosage interval would be
24 hours some patients take insulin twice a day so their dosing schedule is 12 hours you subtract from that
24 or 12 or whatever the estimated fasting interval so say for instance the patient usually takes their
morning dose at eight o'clock they are only expected to be able to eat by one this afternoon their case is
at about 11 and they're going to come out of theater and by about one o'clock they should be able to eat
so what you would do is this eight till one o'clock that's five hours so that five you subtract from that
interval time 24 or 12 just subtract that from the normal interval and divide it by that normal
interval and that gives you the fraction of the morning dose that they should then have so let's be
clear if they're coming in for short procedure first thing in the morning and within an hour or two
they'll be able to take you can just admit all their glucose if it's going to be longer before they
can eat or longer procedure or longer delay before they get to you have to give them some insulin in the
morning together with putting up a drip for them so that they can get intravenous glucose and for
them you are going to give a certain dose and you can work out the fraction of the dose that they would
usually take in the morning so that little algebraic formula there you'll use that and that works out the
fraction of the morning dose which is then giving usually as an intermediate acting insulin now if there's
any longer delay or patient has a type of procedure which they are going to be null for us afterwards
some abdominal procedure like a colectomy now we really have to consider putting them on a sliding
scale from the get-go now the sliding scale is very individualized we we usually have these written up as
a protocol but there's something that underpins that protocol or algorithm that you have in your unit
it works like this take about a thousand eight hundred or a thousand five hundred in patients
who are more insulin sensitive and you divide into that the total daily dose of insulin so if they get
35 units per day or 40 units per day divide that that becomes the denominator divide that into your
1800 and that will give you in milligrams per deciliter the amount that their blood glucose level will be
lowered by giving them one unit of fast acting or rapid acting insulin okay i'll say that again so
you take 1800 divided by the total daily units of insulin and that will give you the lowering capacity
in milligrams per deciliter the amount that their blood glucose levels will fall if you give them
one unit of act rapid that is what that is what underpins because it's different for every patient underpins
a generic sliding scale once again you can multiply that value by 0.0555 and that will give you
the millimoles per liter so you can work out by how much you want to
decrease that and by that you can work out how much insulin to give them that is what underpins and that is
where you get this genetic sliding scale from now remember in all these surgical patients you have to
regularly check the blood glucose levels at least every hour these patients demand more resources
you have to watch them pre-operatively intraoperatively post-operatively never forget hypoglycemia though
in these patients we know without very tight control patients do suffer from hypoglycemia
if they were switched to just normal saline in the ivy line they continue to get some form of insulin they
can get hypoglycemia watch out for those be ready with 50 dextrose water as a small bolus dose or
then just switching over to glucose containing five percent dextrose water for instance watch out for
fluid shifts surgery causes fluid shifts if patients have high blood glucose levels they're going to
have an osmotic diuresis so be on top of the fluid requirements be on top of the electrolyte
disturbances glucose plus insulin will give you a movement of potassium into the intercellular space
so watch out for those disturbances very lastly just a few words on hypoglycemia now
different patients experience hypoglycemia differently at different levels and in each
patient different levels on different days might cause hypoglycemia so it's not this absolute cut off
first of all they'll get this adrenergic response they'll get hungry they'll get tremors they'll get
palpitations and then the the more important neuronal deficits as the neurons are starved of glucose and remember
your neurons can only burn glucose as an energy source and they can become comatose delirious they can
get convulsions usually all starts off by by by fatigue though and this does carry morbidity they can
develop damage to the neuronal tissue and even mortality so if they're awake and they can take
only give them a sugary drink don't give them tablets containing sugar so you might have have
solution creating a solution problem or there might be precipitation so give them a sugary drink or if
they can't take give them intravenous fluid and then monitor their blood glucose levels at least every 15 minutes
so the diabetic patient is important it takes a lot of effort and resources but put that into your diabetic
patient and understand why that algorithm works the way it does in your patient and if you have to change
it slightly for to individualize care remember these things that i've mentioned in this lecture
