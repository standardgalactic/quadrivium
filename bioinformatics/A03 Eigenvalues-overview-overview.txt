The text describes solving a system of linear differential equations using algebraic techniques by finding the eigenvalues. The given system is:

\[ x' = x + 3y \]
\[ y' = 5x + 3y \]

To solve it, we first express the system in matrix form:

\[ \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 5 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} \]

The matrix \( A \) is:

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 5 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

Next, we find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation derived from setting the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \) to zero. Here, \( I \) is the identity matrix:

\[ A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 1-\lambda & 3 \\ 5 & 3-\lambda \end{bmatrix} \]

The determinant is calculated as follows:

\[ (1-\lambda)(3-\lambda) - 15 = \lambda^2 - 4\lambda - 12 \]

Setting this equal to zero gives the characteristic equation:

\[ \lambda^2 - 4\lambda - 12 = 0 \]

Solving the quadratic equation, we find the eigenvalues:

\[ (\lambda - 6)(\lambda + 2) = 0 \]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 6\) and \(\lambda_2 = -2\). These eigenvalues are crucial for understanding the behavior of solutions to the differential system.
