The text provides a detailed explanation of how to find the indefinite integrals of the tangent and secant functions using substitution and clever manipulation.

1. **Indefinite Integral of Tangent Function (\(\tan(x)\)):**
   - The function is rewritten as \(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\).
   - A substitution is made with \( u = \cos(x) \), leading to \( du = -\sin(x) dx \). This transforms the integral into:
     \[
     \int \frac{-1}{u} \, du
     \]
   - The result of this integration is:
     \[
     -\ln|u| + C = -\ln|\cos(x)| + C
     \]

2. **Indefinite Integral of Secant Function (\(\sec(x)\)):**
   - Direct substitution with \(\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\) isn't useful.
   - A clever approach involves using the derivative of \(\tan(x) + \sec(x)\), which is \(\sec^2(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)\).
   - By letting \( u = \tan(x) + \sec(x) \), we have \( du = (\sec^2(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)) dx \), and thus:
     \[
     \frac{du}{u} = \sec(x) \, dx
     \]
   - Integrating both sides gives:
     \[
     \int \sec(x) \, dx = \ln|u| + C = \ln|\tan(x) + \sec(x)| + C
     \]

The text emphasizes the creative problem-solving methods used by mathematicians like Newton and Leibniz to derive these results. The final expression for the integral of \(\sec(x)\) is:

\[
\int \sec(x) \, dx = \ln|\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C
\]
