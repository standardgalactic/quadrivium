The text you provided seems to discuss concepts related to Compton scattering, which is a phenomenon in quantum physics where X-ray or gamma-ray photons scatter off electrons. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Compton Scattering**: This occurs when an incoming photon (like an X-ray) collides with a free electron and transfers some of its energy to the electron, resulting in a longer wavelength for the scattered photon.

2. **Wavelength Shift**: The change in wavelength (\(\lambda' - \lambda\)) is given by the Compton formula:
   \[
   \Delta \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c} (1 - \cos \theta)
   \]
   where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m_e \) is the electron mass, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \theta \) is the scattering angle.

3. **Energy Considerations**: The energy of the incoming photon is given by \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). After scattering, the photon has less energy (longer wavelength), and the difference in energy becomes the kinetic energy of the electron.

4. **Kinetic Energy Calculation**: For a photon scattered at 180 degrees (\(\theta = 180^\circ\)), the change in wavelength is maximized:
   \[
   \Delta \lambda = \frac{2h}{m_e c}
   \]
   The kinetic energy \( K \) of the electron can be calculated using:
   \[
   K = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}}
   \]

5. **Velocity Calculation**: Assuming non-relativistic speeds, the velocity \( v \) of the electron can be found from its kinetic energy:
   \[
   K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2
   \]
   Solving for \( v \), you get:
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2K}{m_e}}
   \]

6. **Example Calculation**: For an X-ray with an initial wavelength of 0.450 nm scattered at 180 degrees, the final velocity of the electron is calculated to be approximately \(3.22 \times 10^6\) m/s.

This process involves using fundamental physics equations to relate the change in photon energy and wavelength to the kinetic energy and velocity of the electron after scattering.
