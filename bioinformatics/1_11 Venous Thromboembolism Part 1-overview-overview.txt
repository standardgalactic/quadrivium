This video series explores venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It covers the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and various risk factors of VTE. Although precise incidence figures are unclear due to underdiagnosis and varied diagnostic tests, there is a lifelong risk of about 1 in 1000 patients.

VTE can be life-threatening, particularly when involving pulmonary embolism, and may lead to chronic disability from venous insufficiency over time. Prevention is highlighted as the best approach compared to treatment.

The clotting mechanism involves an equilibrium between coagulation and anticoagulation systems, crucial for repairing endothelial damage and preventing blood loss. Verco's triad—comprising intimal injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability—explains the imbalance leading to thrombus formation.

Key risk factors include:
- **History of VTE**: Prior incidents increase recurrence risk.
- **Age**: Incidence rises significantly after age 40.
- **Major Surgery**: High-risk surgeries include abdominal, pelvic, and orthopedic procedures.
- **Malignancy**: Trousseau syndrome links cancer with thrombosis; increased risk in patients with thrombophilias like factor V Leiden mutation or prothrombin gene mutations.
- **Obesity**: Particularly risky for women using contraceptives.
- **Trauma**: Increased risks linked to specific fractures and surgeries post-trauma.
- **Immobilization/Paralysis**: Known risk, with debated significance of prolonged air travel without additional risk factors.
- **Hormones**: Oral contraceptives (especially third-generation progestogens) and hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women increase VTE risk.
- **Pregnancy and Post-partum**: Possible at any stage, often affecting the left leg.
- **Central Venous Catheters**: Particularly risky when placed in lower extremity veins.
- **Varicose Veins/Thrombophlebitis**: Associated with DVT but not causative.
- **Cardiac Disease**: High risk of DVT due to immobilization, especially post-myocardial infarction.
- **Hypercoagulable States**: Includes conditions like factor V Leiden mutation and antiphospholipid syndromes.

Understanding these risk factors is crucial for the effective prevention and management of VTE.
