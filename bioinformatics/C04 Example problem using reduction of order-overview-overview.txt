The text outlines a method to solve a second-order linear ordinary differential equation using reduction of order when one solution is already known. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Problem Setup**: A differential equation with the interval from 0 to positive infinity (excluding zero) has a known independent solution \( y_1 = x^2 \).

2. **Reduction of Order Method**: This method reduces the equation's order by substituting \( y = u(x) \cdot y_1(x) \), specifically \( y = ux^2 \). The objective is to find another linearly independent solution.

3. **Derivatives Calculation**:
   - First derivative: \( y' = u'x^2 + 2ux \)
   - Second derivative: \( y'' = u''x^2 + 4u'x + 2u \)

4. **Substitution into Differential Equation**: These derivatives are substituted back, leading to an equation for \( u \).

5. **Simplification**: The resulting equation is simplified by dividing through by \( x^2 \), yielding:
   - \( u'' + \frac{1}{x}u' = 0 \)

6. **Solution via Integration**:
   - Solving this gives \( w = C_2 x^{-1} \) where \( w = u' \)
   - Integrating further, \( u = C_2 \ln|x| + C_3 \)

7. **Final Solution**: Substituting back provides the general solution:
   - \( y = C_1 x^2 \ln|x| + C_2 x^2 \)
   - Ensuring linear independence of solutions \( x^2 \ln(x) \) and \( x^2 \).

The text concludes that \( y = C_1 x^2 \ln(x) + C_2 x^2 \) is the general solution for the given differential equation.

Additionally, there's a mention of terms with numerical coefficients and descriptors, suggesting an attempt to form or analyze a mathematical sequence. This part seems incomplete and lacks clarity on its purpose or context within the text.
