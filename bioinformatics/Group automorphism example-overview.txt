The text provides a clear and structured explanation of group automorphisms using the example of a cyclic group with three elements. Here's a summary:

1. **Introduction to Cyclic Group**: The text begins by considering a set with three elements, focusing on its symmetric group (all possible permutations). From this, it extracts a cyclic subgroup (C3) consisting of three permutations: 
   - Identity element \( E \): Maps each element to itself.
   - \( \sigma \): Transforms 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1.
   - \( \sigma^2 \): Transforms 1 to 3, 3 to 2, and 2 to 1.

2. **Cayley Table**: The composition of these permutations is outlined using a Cayley table:
   - \( E \) is the identity element.
   - Composing \( \sigma \) with itself gives \( \sigma^2 \).
   - Composing \( \sigma \) and \( \sigma^2 \) (in either order) returns \( E \).
   - Composing \( \sigma^2 \) with itself returns \( \sigma \).

3. **Automorphisms**: An automorphism is a bijective mapping from the group to itself that preserves the group operation.
   - The text demonstrates one possible automorphism, \( F \), which maps:
     - \( E \to E \)
     - \( \sigma \to \sigma^2 \)
     - \( \sigma^2 \to \sigma \)

4. **Verification**: It verifies that this mapping preserves the group operation by checking a few cases using the Cayley table.

5. **Properties of Automorphisms**: The text concludes that automorphisms form a group, denoted as the group of automorphisms of \( G \) (Aut(G)), which includes:
   - Identity mapping (\( F_E \))
   - Another possible automorphism (\( F_1 \))

6. **Conclusion**: Each automorphism has an inverse within this set, showcasing the structure and beauty of group automorphisms in a simple example.

This explanation effectively illustrates the concept of group automorphisms using a small cyclic group as a model.

The text provides a detailed explanation and example of group automorphisms using a cyclic group with three elements. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Introduction to Automorphisms**: The text starts by discussing group automorphisms, which are bijective mappings from a group to itself that preserve the group operation.

2. **Example Setup**: It introduces a set with three elements and considers its symmetric group, which consists of all permutations of these elements. From this, it selects a cyclic subgroup (denoted as \( C_3 \)) with three elements: the identity permutation \( E \), a permutation \( \sigma \) that maps 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1, and \( \sigma^2 \), which maps 1 to 3, 3 to 2, and 2 to 1.

3. **Cayley Table**: The text constructs a Cayley table for the cyclic group \( C_3 \) to illustrate the composition of its elements. This helps visualize how each element interacts under the group operation (composition).

4. **Automorphism Example**: An automorphism is demonstrated by mapping:
   - \( E \) to \( E \)
   - \( \sigma \) to \( \sigma^2 \)
   - \( \sigma^2 \) to \( \sigma \)

   This mapping is shown to be a bijection (one-to-one and onto).

5. **Verification of Automorphism**: The text verifies that this mapping preserves the group operation by checking specific compositions, such as \( \sigma \circ \sigma^2 = E \), ensuring the automorphic property holds.

6. **Group of Automorphisms**: It concludes by noting that the set of all such automorphisms forms a group itself, with operations like composition, associativity, identity, and inverses being naturally satisfied.

This example illustrates the concept of group automorphisms in a simple setting, helping to understand how these mappings work within group theory.
