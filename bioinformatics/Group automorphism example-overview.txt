The text provides a clear and structured explanation of group automorphisms using the example of a cyclic group with three elements. Here's a summary:

1. **Introduction to Cyclic Group**: The text begins by considering a set with three elements, focusing on its symmetric group (all possible permutations). From this, it extracts a cyclic subgroup (C3) consisting of three permutations: 
   - Identity element \( E \): Maps each element to itself.
   - \( \sigma \): Transforms 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1.
   - \( \sigma^2 \): Transforms 1 to 3, 3 to 2, and 2 to 1.

2. **Cayley Table**: The composition of these permutations is outlined using a Cayley table:
   - \( E \) is the identity element.
   - Composing \( \sigma \) with itself gives \( \sigma^2 \).
   - Composing \( \sigma \) and \( \sigma^2 \) (in either order) returns \( E \).
   - Composing \( \sigma^2 \) with itself returns \( \sigma \).

3. **Automorphisms**: An automorphism is a bijective mapping from the group to itself that preserves the group operation.
   - The text demonstrates one possible automorphism, \( F \), which maps:
     - \( E \to E \)
     - \( \sigma \to \sigma^2 \)
     - \( \sigma^2 \to \sigma \)

4. **Verification**: It verifies that this mapping preserves the group operation by checking a few cases using the Cayley table.

5. **Properties of Automorphisms**: The text concludes that automorphisms form a group, denoted as the group of automorphisms of \( G \) (Aut(G)), which includes:
   - Identity mapping (\( F_E \))
   - Another possible automorphism (\( F_1 \))

6. **Conclusion**: Each automorphism has an inverse within this set, showcasing the structure and beauty of group automorphisms in a simple example.

This explanation effectively illustrates the concept of group automorphisms using a small cyclic group as a model.
