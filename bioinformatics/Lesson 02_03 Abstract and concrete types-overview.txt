The text discusses how every type in Julia is categorized as either an abstract or concrete type. Concrete types, located at the bottom of the hierarchy, are capable of holding actual objects and taking up space in computer memory. In contrast, abstract types cannot be instantiated; they serve more like conceptual categories rather than storing specific data.

Every type inherits properties from its parent, a fundamental concept for organizing programming languages efficiently. When dealing with concrete types, you must specify them precisely to store values (e.g., using `Float64` instead of a generic `real`). These objects occupy memory space, which is finite and depends on the data type's size.

For instance, an 8-bit integer (`Int8`) occupies less memory than larger integers or floating-point numbers. The text explains how you can determine the range of values that each integer type can hold using functions like `typemin` and `typemax`. An `Int8` ranges from -128 to 127, while a 16-bit integer (`Int16`) spans from -32,767 to 32,767. These limits are essential because attempting to store a value outside this range would result in errors due to insufficient memory allocation for that type.

The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding these memory constraints when programming with Julia.

The text provides an overview of how types are structured in Julia, a programming language. In Julia, every type is either abstract or concrete. Concrete types are at the bottom of the hierarchy and can hold actual objects, whereas abstract types cannot be instantiated.

Concrete types like `Float64` can hold values directly (e.g., `Float64 = 3.46758`), but you cannot instantiate abstract types such as `Real`. Each type in Julia inherits from its parent, facilitating a well-structured programming language hierarchy.

The text also discusses memory allocation: different types require varying amounts of memory. For example, an 8-bit integer (`Int8`) has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum of +127 due to limited memory space. An increase in bit size allows for larger ranges (e.g., `Int16` with a range from -32,768 to 32,767).

Understanding these type limits is crucial when working with Julia, as attempting to store values outside the allowed range will lead to errors due to insufficient memory allocation.
