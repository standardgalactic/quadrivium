Certainly! Here's a summary and explanation of the key points from your text about numbers and powers:

### Summary

1. **Rational Numbers**:
   - Can be expressed as fractions \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are integers, and \( q \neq 0 \).
   - Their decimal expansions either terminate or repeat indefinitely (e.g., \( 0.333...\) for \( \frac{1}{3}\)).

2. **Irrational Numbers**:
   - Cannot be expressed as fractions.
   - Have non-repeating, non-terminating decimal expansions (e.g., \( \sqrt{2} \), \( \pi\)).
   - Often appear in contexts requiring precise approximations.

3. **Real Numbers (\( \mathbb{R} \))**:
   - Include all rational and irrational numbers.
   - Represent every point on the number line, encompassing fractions, terminating decimals, repeating decimals, and non-repeating decimals like \( \pi \) or \( \sqrt{2}\).

4. **Integers (\( \mathbb{Z} \))**:
   - Whole numbers that include negatives, zero, and positives (e.g., -3, 0, 7).

5. **Powers in Mathematics**:
   - Represented as \( a^n \), meaning multiplying the base \( a \) by itself \( n \) times.
   - **Positive Integer Exponents**: Multiply the base repeatedly.
   - **Exponent Zero**: Any non-zero number raised to zero is 1 (\( a^0 = 1\)).
   - **Negative Exponents**: Represent reciprocals (\( a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}\)).

6. **Properties of Operations**:
   - **Commutative Property**: Order doesn't matter for addition or multiplication.
   - **Associative Property**: Grouping doesn’t affect the result for addition or multiplication.
   - **Distributive Property**: Connects addition and multiplication, allowing distribution across terms inside parentheses.

7. **Order of Operations**:
   - Follow PEMDAS/BODMAS rules: Parentheses first, then Exponents, followed by Multiplication/Division (left to right), and finally Addition/Subtraction (left to right).

8. **Logarithms**:
   - The natural logarithm uses base \( e \) (Euler’s number).
   - Answers the question of what power a number must be raised to obtain another number.

### Key Concepts

- **Rational vs. Irrational**: Understanding the difference between fractions and non-fraction numbers helps in identifying their properties.
- **Real Numbers**: The broadest category that includes all possible numerical values on the number line.
- **Powers and Exponents**: Essential for understanding growth rates, scaling, and various algebraic operations.
- **Properties of Arithmetic Operations**: Ensure consistency and correctness in mathematical manipulations.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for a strong foundation in mathematics, as they are used extensively across different areas of study.

Let's break down the process of adding fractions with different denominators using the least common multiple (LCM) method, and apply it to your examples:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Example: Adding \( \frac{5}{12} + \frac{7}{15} \)

1. **Find the LCM of the Denominators:**
   - Prime factorization:
     - \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \)
     - \( 15 = 3 \times 5 \)
   - Determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime number present in any factorization:
     - LCM = \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60 \)

2. **Convert Each Fraction to Have the Common Denominator:**
   - For \( \frac{5}{12} \):
     - Multiply both numerator and denominator by 5 (since \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \)):
     \[
     \frac{5}{12} = \frac{25}{60}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{7}{15} \):
     - Multiply both numerator and denominator by 4 (since \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \)):
     \[
     \frac{7}{15} = \frac{28}{60}
     \]

3. **Add the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{25}{60} + \frac{28}{60} = \frac{53}{60}
   \]

The sum of \( \frac{5}{12} \) and \( \frac{7}{15} \) is \( \frac{53}{60} \).

#### Example: Adding \( \frac{a}{16} + \frac{b}{18} \)

1. **Find the LCM of the Denominators:**
   - Prime factorization:
     - \( 16 = 2^4 \)
     - \( 18 = 2 \times 3^2 \)
   - Determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime number present in any factorization:
     - LCM = \( 2^4 \times 3^2 = 144 \)

2. **Convert Each Fraction to Have the Common Denominator:**
   - For \( \frac{a}{16} \):
     - Multiply both numerator and denominator by 9 (since \( 16 \times 9 = 144 \)):
     \[
     \frac{a}{16} = \frac{9a}{144}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{b}{18} \):
     - Multiply both numerator and denominator by 8 (since \( 18 \times 8 = 144 \)):
     \[
     \frac{b}{18} = \frac{8b}{144}
     \]

3. **Add the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{9a}{144} + \frac{8b}{144} = \frac{9a + 8b}{144}
   \]

The sum of \( \frac{a}{16} \) and \( \frac{b}{18} \) is \( \frac{9a + 8b}{144} \).

### Key Points

- **Denominator:** The number below the fraction line indicating into how many parts something is divided.
- **Numerator:** The number above the fraction line indicating how many of those parts are being considered.
- **LCM Method:** Finding a common denominator using the least common multiple to ensure fractions can be added directly. 

This method ensures that fractions with different denominators can be combined into a single fraction, facilitating easier calculation and comparison.

The text outlines a method for finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, 16 and 18, using prime factorization. It explains that:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - The number 16 is broken down into \(2^4\).
   - The number 18 is broken down into \(2 \times 3^2\).

2. **Finding the LCM:**
   - Identify the highest powers of all prime numbers involved:
     - Highest power of 2: \(2^4\) (from 16)
     - Highest power of 3: \(3^2\) (from 18)

3. **Calculate the LCM:**
   - Multiply these highest powers together: \(2^4 \times 3^2 = 144\).
   - Thus, the LCM of 16 and 18 is 144.

4. **Verification by Multiplication:**
   - Confirm that multiplying 16 by 9 yields 144.
   - Confirm that multiplying 18 by 8 also results in 144.

5. **Application to Fractions:**
   - To add fractions with denominators of 16 and 18, convert them to a common denominator of 144:
     - Multiply the fraction with a denominator of 16 by \(\frac{9}{9}\).
     - Multiply the fraction with a denominator of 18 by \(\frac{8}{8}\).

The text demonstrates how using prime factorization simplifies finding the LCM and makes operations like adding fractions more straightforward.
