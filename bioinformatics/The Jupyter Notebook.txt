and here we presented with the ipython notebook you'll see i'm using the chrome browser here
and it starts off with a notebook there and it's because i launched it while i was in my
home directory it's going to show that up and this is just our normal normal folder structure
on my computer i'm going to go here to my desktop and healthcare research lectures there and
there is one file in the it's an ipymb ipython file ipython notebook file i should say i can
delete it there which i don't want to do and if i click on it it's going to open before i do that
i just want to show you this new notebook so that is how we're going to create a new notebook i think
i'll repeat it later whenever you open a new notebook that notebook's going to be saved on
your hard drive in whichever folder you are in at the moment so let's just click new folder there
on your notebook and this is what it looks like i'm going to run through that again
in a minute and you can click on there to go to the website there's the name we'll run through that
this is our toolbar up here and normal things that you would see there file edit view the normal
things in some other weird ones and a save button again insert cells cut and copy and paste we can
see moving cells up and down and then more importantly the plane of the cells and the type of cells we'll get
to that again and this is the beauty of ipython so this is a cell this is where you're going to type
your code at the moment the cell that is active is set to code but look i can also set it to markdown
markdown there's a special uh shorthand sort of uh computer code that you can write text with but you
can also use normal html tags now in this and it will render this code to this web page as if it is
code written specifically for a web page some shortcuts there heading one heading two remember
from html this would just be the size of the text so in short this is a notebook but let's open the one
that we really want to see when i've left it open there so it says i can shut it down the other way to
shut it down would be first to save it and then just say file close and halt now when i'm when i go
there it's not open anymore we can delete it there's the delete button so let's open introduction
to the ipython notebook now immediately you'll see that it has changed its look it doesn't look like
the other one and that's because of this code now this code is going to run immediately all these
files look the same it'll say setting up fancy a fancy style sheet you can do some css files
so don't worry that's not part of the course but you can write some style sheets cascading style
sheets you can import that and that will render this web page looking a bit different so this is
the render i've gone for and the design that i've gone for just for this course so don't worry about
this few lines of code what i do want to show you if i go into that first cell and double click on it
to edit it you'll see it is markdown and i can just type normal text in there i didn't even use
any html or markdown language i just typed in that and if i run that it is just normal html output to
this web page now in cell 2 we're going to run that don't worry about this code but to execute it i'm in
that cell and i just hit the play button and it executes now you're going to see this numbering
down here the first time that you run it you're not going to see these numbers but
it's going to start off always with number one and when you hit enter and that code is busy
executing there'll be a little star there and then it turns to whatever number cell is these are really
not important for us the other thing that i'm always going to do at the top of these cells is just
to set up my python environment this is going to start looking a lot more complicated and we'll go
through this for the moment i'm just using this code ignore that for now all i want to do is run it
remember here i press the play button here i'll do the other way of doing it you hold down the shift
key and then hit the return or enter key and that will also play that cell so look at this cell it's
nice and fancy and big text if i double click on it you'll see it is the cell is marked as h1 heading
one and my style sheet will render the type of text that i wanted there so it's just a nice way to lay
out your notebook if you wanted to hand this notebook over to someone else with some text and coding in
this is a lovely way to do it and that is why ipython is so fantastic for scientific computing because
you can really collaborate send your notebooks to someone else you can annotate it with normal text
intermix it with code it's just fantastic there's our citation there for fernando perez and the guys
who develops who developed ipython and still actively developing it i think you can't say enough
about this ipython ipython notebook if it really is phenomenal what these guys have done and are doing
so this ipython it's not only the notebook that we're dealing with here if you use something like
anaconda to install your python environment specifically on the windows and mac version
you're going to get a launcher that also has the other two parts of the ipython family and number
one is just going to be a terminal window called the qt console and that just looks like a normal
command prompt window or terminal window and you can write your ipython code there and there's also
the scientific development environment called spider that is also installed we're not going to use that
we make use of this notebook now you can learn a lot more just to show you this cell here learning more i
just type the letters and i marked it as heading two and when i execute it by holding and shift hitting
return or enter it renders beautifully as h2 text now you can learn a lot more from the ipython website itself
let's see how i constructed the cell p the tags p there that's normal html that's just paragraph close paragraph
you don't have to learn html code or markdown code but you'll pick it up just by double clicking on the cells and
quickly learn the basics of it html is really easy and this is these two star signs here which is shift
8 on most on most keyboards that is just the shortcut for italics so anything between two stars and
there's got to be no spaces there will output just as italics the other way to do it was just use html tags
that would be i and remember always to close your tags close i so anything between those tags would
be italicized and the website i just typed that normally ipython change that into a link for me
so if i hit enter see the ipython there is in italics now you can with the notebook also just have live
websites so i've written some code don't worry about this code it's not part of the course
but look there the source is this website and i'm showing it how big frame to allow inside of this
page and it will actually render the live this is the live website and so you can even embed live
websites you can embed youtube videos there's all sorts of code that you can write in python
to do all of this for you no matter all i want you to do here is to visit that website you can
obviously learn a lot more about ipython so let's just quickly rerun through the essentials
there's various ways to start ipython notebook one way is to use the launcher which installs with
anaconda for the python version 3.4 and up on windows and mac on linux though you'll have to open a
terminal window but even in windows you can open a command prompt window or linux or mac open a
terminal window and you just type in ipython notebook and you hit enter or return it's going to open your
default browser in the folder that you are currently in when you ran this command in terminal window
whatever folder you are in on your computer's hard disk it's going to open in that in your default
browser as we saw before so with these modern versions of anaconda 3.4 you actually get this
navigation you do get this navigation that that did not always exist didn't exist before but you can
so i showed you how to open the new notebook and i also showed you the toolbar if you were to click
look here i've just imported an image which lives in this very same folder so i can just refer to the
file itself in the same folder that this notebook is in so this file is right in this folder it doesn't
show up because it's not a notebook but because it lives in the same folder i can just reference it if
it wasn't i would have to put in c colon forward slash forward slash for windows or where wherever it was
hidden i had to write out the whole computer address for this but because they're in the same folder i
can just do this and there's a beautiful image what i wanted to show you here is if you double click
there in other words this is going to show up and you can rename or name your notebook there that name
will then be saved and it will update there okay the cells we've spoken about that is really the beauty of
ipython if i double click on there there's that code see all the p's close p open p close p open p close p
so this is all going to be rendered as as paragraphs each between each of these p's and close p's that
will render as a paragraph and then we'll start a new paragraph there and remember the little star signs
yes those were just for italicizing and you can see the cell is marked on italicizing that text so if i
run it one two three paragraphs and we've got the italics there nb convert we'll talk about that a little
bit later there is a way then in the terminal or command prompt window that you can use ipython space
nb convert and then the name of your file and that will convert it to another format so you can do
html you can do pdf and we'll do a bit of that later on and that's a beautiful way to save these notebooks
in a different format than the ipymb format you can save it as html or pdf as i mentioned and you can
share it with someone else let's start coding a bit now usually with learning computer language people
start with a hello world example i'd like to start with some mathematics though now the one of the
basic building blocks spacing building blocks of any computer language is the variable
now i use the term computer variable because i also do a lot of lectures in maths and obviously a
mathematical variable is something other than a computer variable so what's a computer variable well
in essence it is this space in a computer's memory we can we can call it an empty bucket
and that variable name is the name we give to that bucket and we can put various things into that bucket
so let's try this out live so in this cell all i've done is i've written a equals seven
just that little bitty there a equals seven a is my variable and its name and so i've created the space
in memory this bucket i've called it a and i've put a value into that seven now the seven is an integer
now look at something you'll see this pound sign hashtag sign whatever you want to call it
anything in a line after this little sign is ignored by python so it will not be executed so if you want
to leave some notes for yourself like i've done here a equals seven the value seven is an integer
that just gets ignored you see it's turned green here and in a new line i've started this new line
look there with another hashtag sign so this line of code will be ignored but it's just that if you
hand this over to someone else or you review your code later on and you've put these little reminders
these little comments you've left them there it'll help you out tremendously
so unlike other computer languages i don't have to tell python what type of data i'm putting in here
this is an integer it'll just infer from context now let's just execute this i'm going to hit shift
enter and nothing happens nothing happens you see this is jump to number three i'm just executing that
nothing has happened it's just created this little space in the computer's ram in the memory
called it a that little space and let's put a value in it very exciting indeed now let's heat things
up let's go to this cell and i'm going to say b equals four hit shift enter shift return or the play
button or i've created another bucket i've put another integer value into it how do i get to what's in
that though i can just simply type a so that will be one way if i just type in a and i hit enter
lo and behold the seven appears it remembers that seven is that so i'm just going to output that so
my input code there in the cell was a i hit shift enter shift return and that's seven another way to
do it is to use the print command print and you're going to put these brackets i want to warn you there's
big difference between the python versions 2 2.7 2.5 2.6 2.7 and the version 3.x 3 3.1 3.2 3.4 as this is
big difference um with those you just had you hit this print a like that okay it's not going to work
if you run older code okay so this is for python versions 3 and up so if i say print a and i run
this lo and behold we're also going to get the seven now let's do some math what is seven to the power
four and this is the way you do powers in python it's this double star sign not like in most
computer languages where you use this carrot you can use the double equal sign so i've written a
now these spaces here you needn't put spaces here we go it's just that and 2401 voila now we can do
simple addition what would be remember i had seven and four if i just typed in seven plus a plus b i
run that obviously that's going to give me an 11 a minus b is going to be three a times b it's just
one star sign that's 28 a divided by b 5.5 now oh where did we go sorry a divided by b 1.75 i'm just
going to warn you as well with the older versions any number that you put in that's an integer is
going to be seen purely as an integer actually in python version 3 or the version 3s it actually sees
these values as floats and if you're using python 2.7 for instance you might get very strange things
when you do division so just watch out for that this is the modulus sign so if i divide seven by four
it goes into into four goes into seven ones and three is left that three is the modulus so that's what
you're going to get there now you can also force the arithmetic operations the the order of that so i want
to add a plus b first and then divide it by two if i didn't use those it was going to do remember b
divided by two and then add that to a so you can force it just by parentheses and now for the reason
why i call these things computer variables because what's going to happen in this line of code a equals
a plus five that makes no algebraic sense as you would well imagine because if i brought a to the
other side it's going to say zero equals five and that doesn't work because these are not algebraic
mathematical variables these are computer variables so what does the computer say it executes the
right hand side of this equation first it says what is an a at the moment well there's seven in there
i'm going to add five to that that makes it twelve and i'm going to put that twelve into that bucket
which was called a okay so that's what's going to do and lo and behold if i print that it's now
twelve he is now twelve now for the real power of python the beauty and power of python we can extend
the language by simply importing code someone else has developed for us and the way to import this is
just to use the import statement import math so math is this a module sometimes we refer to these as
libraries modules someone who's intimately familiar with with python and computer language will
obviously know what the differences are for us we can just call it whatever we want import math so
let's run that code so math is now part it's extended it's in in its little mind python's mind it's extended
all the code you can use by importing this math module now i'm can i'm going to use the sign of pi
now i have to refer to this module or library first before i can use whatever's inside of it so i have
to say math dot sign of math dot pi and that's not the way we're going to do it i'm just showing you how
to reference code that's inside of a library so i have to use the library name and then whatever's inside
of it so this math dot sign the sign will be a method inside of the math module there if i execute that
you're going to see something very funny now remember pi has got an infinite number of decimal places it
goes on forever your computer can't do that it's going to truncate it somewhere and then it's going to
take the sign of that truncated value and it can do quite a fair bit with that because but because it's not
an exact thing that it doesn't go off to infinity you are going to get this scientific notation 1.2
times 10 to the power negative 16 while anything with 16 zeros after the decimal point you can
obviously see python was trying to say that this is zero the sign of pi or the sign of 180 degrees is
zero a better way to do or another way to import modules is to say from math import then these
methods that you want cosine pi so it's only going to import those let's run that the beauty of that
though is now i don't have to refer to that module name i don't have to say math dot cosine math dot pi
i can just say the cosine of pi so what's the cosine of 180 degrees obviously it's negative one
so that's one way but you have to explicitly write all these functions or methods that you want
to import another way to do it is to say import numpy that's the same as we said they import math but
give it an abbreviation so import numpy numpy is this beautiful beautiful module that can do all sorts
of numerical calculations and i'm going to abbreviate it by this np so if i run that python has extended
itself but it's given it's imported this numpy module and but it's given it an abbreviation so if
i now want to refer to the cosine which lives inside of python i can just say np dot cosine i don't have
to write out numpy as i had to write out math there so i'm going to say np dot cosine of the np dot pi
and if i run that lo and behold of course it's also negative one last thing we're going to look
at quickly is this this uh using strings a variable can also contain other things not only integers or
floating point values you have to say a equals okay hello world okay here we go hello world and i've got
to put it in these inverted commas now you can use you can use double quotes or single quotes it doesn't
matter i like single quotes but if you want if you want this to to be a string you've got to put it
inside of these inverted commas so let's just run that if i now were to say a type in a and run it it's
going to output that to the screen okay here we go hello world another way to do it but see these little
quotation marks they've added them because that's the output it's trying to i suppose for lack of a better
explanation trying to see it as a as a numerical value it's putting these pay no uh need to what
i've just said print a if i do that it's really just going to print out just the text okay here we go
hello world i can attach something else to b now this is python and run that and i can now concatenate
these two strings i can say a plus now that's another string i'm putting in there with which is an empty
space plus b i'm adding a space between these two strings and because i'm using the plus concatenation
so if i were to run that it's going to do them all in one go okay hello world okay here we go hello
world this is python so it's added those two together i can use the print command and separate it with a
comma then i don't need to add that space or anything funny like that if i were to run this it was going to
concatenate them and put that little space in there okay here we go hello world this is python
now for surprise what is a times two if i were to run that lo and behold here we go okay here we go
hello world okay here we go hello world so it's just going to output that twice
let's put something else let's put something else into a so i've got these three integer values but i've
enclosed them in the square bracket and that is what is called an array an array of values
the first one is going to be called a zero that's going to be a one and this is going to be a two
python always starts counting things from zero so if i now output it a to the screen it's going to give
me this whole thing and if i were to multiply an array by two it's not going to multiply each individual
entry by two that would be a matrix that's something else it's just going to repeat this array twice
12 times 13 times 12 13 18 3 12 13 18 so it's just done it twice i can do a lot more with an array
that's an integer that's an ancient integer that's string text and that's just the computer variable b
so i can put all sorts of things in there now you see it's two three hello and remember b was this is
python so it'll put this is python there so that's an array and the very last thing there's some boolean
values what are boolean values there's our first one a double equal sign and that is a question you
ask the computer is whatever's in variable a equal to whatever is in variable b it asks that question so
if i were to run that it's going to say false because remember a was okay here we go hello world
and b was and this is python and those two strings are definitely not the same this is the question
mark the boolean question mark a question i should say is not equal to so it's an exclamation mark equal
so i'm asking is whatever's in a not equal to what is in b and definitely that is so so those whatever's
inside of variable a and variable b are not the same so this will execute as true so let's just check
that out one more time a equals i love math as a string a equals equals i love math so i'm asking it
is that what is inside of a at the moment yes it is true so that's your very quick introduction
to a bit of coding more importantly the introduction to ipython notebook i think you can be familiar
now with how these cells work and i've introduced just the tiniest bit of code nothing too difficult
watch this lecture again work your way through this don't be scared to alter things mess them about
you've got to play with us to understand how it works this is all easy but the things that i've shown
you here we are going to use in the in future for this lecture series and as you start manipulating
your own data these are the common things that we're going to use over and over again really doesn't
get much more difficult than this easy introduction to coding i hope you enjoyed it
