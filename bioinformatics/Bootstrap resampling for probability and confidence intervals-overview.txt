To summarize and complete your explanation of bootstrapping to calculate a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean, let's break down the steps you've outlined:

### Bootstrapping Process

1. **Original Sample**: Start with your original sample data (`var1`), which contains 100 measurements.

2. **Resampling with Replacement**:
   - Use bootstrapping to create multiple resampled datasets from `var1`.
   - Each resample should have the same number of observations as the original (i.e., 100).
   - Sampling is done "with replacement," meaning the same observation can appear more than once in a resample.

3. **Calculating Means**:
   - For each resampled dataset, calculate its mean.
   - Repeat this process many times (e.g., 1000 iterations) to build a distribution of means.

4. **Creating a Histogram**:
   - Plot the histogram of these bootstrap means to visualize their distribution.

5. **Determining Percentiles for Confidence Interval**:
   - To find the 95% CI, determine the values at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.
   - Sort the list of bootstrap means in ascending order.
   - Identify the indices corresponding to these percentiles (e.g., 25th and 975th positions for a sample size of 1000).

6. **Confidence Interval**:
   - The value at the 2.5th percentile is the lower bound of your CI, and the value at the 97.5th percentile is the upper bound.
   - In this example, these values are approximately 99.039 (lower bound) and 102.795 (upper bound).

7. **Interpretation**:
   - The original sample mean (101.5) falls within this interval.
   - You can state with 95% confidence that the true population mean lies between approximately 99.039 and 102.795.

### Conclusion

Bootstrapping is a powerful statistical method for estimating the sampling distribution of an estimator by resampling with replacement from the original data. It allows you to construct confidence intervals even when traditional assumptions (such as normality) may not hold. By following these steps, you can effectively use bootstrapping to estimate the 95% CI for your sample mean or other statistics.

The text discusses statistical concepts related to confidence intervals, p-values, and hypothesis testing. It explains that a 95% confidence interval (99.2 to 102.7) does not imply certainty about the population parameter but indicates that if the study were repeated many times, approximately 95 out of 100 intervals would contain the true population mean.

The text elaborates on the null hypothesis, which states there is no difference in means between two groups. To test this, a resampling method (bootstrap) is used: values from both groups are combined and randomly reassigned to simulate the null hypothesis. The process involves calculating new differences in means repeatedly to create a sampling distribution.

The text describes using these simulations to estimate a p-value, which measures how likely it is to observe a difference as extreme as the one found (test statistic) under the null hypothesis. By comparing simulated values to the actual observed mean difference, fractions of more extreme outcomes are calculated on both sides, leading to an overall p-value.

Finally, this simulation approach (resampling) helps express uncertainty in results and validates findings by comparison with traditional statistical tests like Student's t-test, demonstrating similar p-values for consistency. The text emphasizes that such methods can be applied beyond means to other statistics like variance or standard deviation.
