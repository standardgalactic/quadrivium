The text outlines a method for solving a specific type of differential equation using substitution. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: The differential equation is \(x^2 y'' + 17xy = 0\). A substitution \(y = x^m\) is proposed to find the solution.

2. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - Substituting \(y = x^m\) results in derivatives: \(y' = mx^{m-1}\) and \(y'' = m(m-1)x^{m-2}\).
   - Plugging these into the equation yields a quadratic form, simplifying to \(4m^2 - 4m + 17 = 0\).

3. **Solving for \(m\)**:
   - The quadratic equation is solved using the quadratic formula, revealing complex roots due to a negative discriminant: \(m = \frac{1}{2} \pm i\sqrt{\frac{15}}{2}\).

4. **General Solution**:
   - The solution involves trigonometric functions because of the imaginary part in \(m\).
   - It is expressed as \(y = x^{1/2}(C_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{2} \ln x) + C_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{2} \ln x))\).

5. **Initial Value Problem**:
   - Using given initial conditions, constants \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are determined.
   - The specific solution becomes \(y = -x^{1/2} \cos(2 \ln x)\) after applying these conditions.

6. **Graphical Representation**:
   - The solution is graphed for positive \(x\), as the logarithm function requires positive arguments.
   - The graph illustrates the behavior of the function within its domain.

This approach demonstrates solving a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients, resulting in complex roots and solutions involving trigonometric expressions.
