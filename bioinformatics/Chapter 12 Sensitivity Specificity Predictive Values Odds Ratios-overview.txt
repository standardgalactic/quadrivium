The lecture discusses evaluating diagnostic tests using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and odds ratios. 

- **Sensitivity** is the probability that a test correctly identifies a patient with the disease (true positives) as positive. It's calculated by dividing the number of true positives (A) by the total number of diseased patients (A + B), then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

- **Specificity** is the probability that a test correctly identifies a patient without the disease (true negatives) as negative. It's calculated by dividing the number of true negatives (D) by the total number of non-diseased patients (C + D), also multiplied by 100 for a percentage.

- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)** is the probability that a person actually has the disease given they tested positive, calculated as the proportion of true positives (A) out of all positive results (A + C).

- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)** is the probability that a person does not have the disease given they tested negative, calculated by dividing true negatives (D) by all negative results (B + D), multiplied by 100 for percentage.

An example with 1,000 patients demonstrates these calculations:

- Sensitivity: With 95 out of 100 diseased patients testing positive, sensitivity is 95%.
  
- Specificity: With 810 out of 900 non-diseased patients testing negative, specificity is 90%.

- PPV: Out of 185 positives (95 true and 90 false), only 95 are true positives, resulting in a PPV of 51.4%.

- NPV: Out of 815 negatives (5 false and 810 true), 810 are true negatives, giving an NPV of 99.4%.

The example highlights that while the test is excellent at ruling out disease with a negative result (high NPV), it's less reliable for confirming disease presence with a positive result (low PPV). 

Odds ratios were mentioned as a method to compare outcomes between two groups but without an illustrative example.

The text discusses comparing two groups that are dissimilar in one aspect by performing an intervention on both. The intervention could lead to either positive or negative outcomes. To analyze the results, count the number of positive and negative outcomes separately for each group, labeling these counts as A (positive outcomes in the first group), B (negative outcomes in the first group), C (positive outcomes in the second group), and D (negative outcomes in the second group). Calculate the odds ratio using the formula \( \frac{A}{C} \times \frac{D}{B} \).
