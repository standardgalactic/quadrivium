Let's just take the series, or the sequence, of just these terms, just all that.
So that's 1 over k, and I'm going from k equals 1, I can't go from 0,
but I'm free to choose because that'll be 1 divided by 0, which is undefined, to infinity.
What happens to the infinite element in my sequence?
Because my first sequence, my first element of my sequence, this is going to be 1.
Let's just put this as A, because we're not going to some, this is just my sequence A.
1, 2 will be a half, 3 will be a third, there'll be a quarter, there'll be a fifth,
and I think you can see that we are indeed heading towards 0.
And as I said, this is the only way in which we're using this.
Not in the genetic, trying to explain things.
It's difficult when you start explaining these things because, once again,
you need information or knowledge of one thing to get to knowledge of the other.
So that's purely to explain sequences and series.
This is how we use it.
We just take our expression of our series into a sequence and we see what happens to the sequence,
to the element in the limit of the sequence.
Okay.
So I'm taking the limit,
because I'm taking the limit as k goes to infinity of 1 over k.
And if I just plug that in, this is 1 over infinity, which is 0.
Now this does not mean, I've got a 0 now,
this does not mean that this converges.
I said it might, if it didn't equal 0,
if the, if the, if the,
if the infinite term was not 0,
then the series diverges.
End of story.
But now it is 0 and now we have to find out,
does this converge or does it not converge?
And in the next video, we'll look at what happens here.
Let's look at what happens here.
And there's a, there's a neat way to explain this.
Let's have a rectangle.
And on this rectangle, we're going to say,
for instance,
I don't know how to draw this exactly,
but let's say this is 1.
This is also 1.
This is 2.
This is 3.
So this is 1 and that is also 1.
1 times 1 is 1.
So the surface area of this rectangle,
draw not to scale, is 1.
Because what am I going to have here?
I'm going to have 1 plus a half plus a third plus a quarter and so on.
So what I'm going to have is 1 plus a half plus a quarter plus an eighth.
And if we do that as left-handed human sums,
it's going to be something like this.
Okay.
So if I do the area under the curve for this graph
and I take this sum,
you'll notice that the area under the curve is slightly smaller
because I have extra bits sticking at the top.
So this S is going to be larger.
The surface area, which is exactly what I have here,
the surface area of this is the height times the width.
1 times 1 is 1.
Half times 1 is a half.
A third times 1 is a third.
This area, if I combine all of that,
so I've represented this as the little rectangular areas,
it's going to be more than, and look at this,
1, this is this graph,
1 of n plus 1 of the natural log,
of k, let me just make sure,
of 1 over x, yeah, 1 over x,
1 over x dx.
So what I've done is,
I've taken this 1 over k,
I'm writing a function of that,
I'm taking this integral,
because if we look at that line of 1,
2 a half, 2 a third there,
that corresponds beautifully to,
what am I doing, let's look,
f 1 over x dx.
Okay, so that'll be 1 over 1,
which is there,
1 over 2, which is there,
1 over 3, which is there,
1 over 4, which is there,
and I'm going from 1,
all the way,
but I'm going to n plus 1,
because I'm taking the left hand,
and then I'm going to go to the end
of that one,
so that'll be my n plus 1 mark then,
because my n mark will be there,
this will be n.
Okay, so if I look at this,
and I take the natural log,
it still says that this surface,
this area,
which is now represented,
the area which is representative
of this sum,
is more than the natural log of x,
and I'm going to go from n plus 1,
to 1,
the natural log of 1 is to 0,
so I'm left with s,
and this is larger than the natural log of n plus 1.
Now I'm letting n go to infinity,
that means the area under the curve
is infinitely large,
and s is even larger than this.
Remember now,
if I take this,
the limit is n goes to infinity.
That limit,
this is even larger than this,
and this is already infinity,
so this series diverges,
because it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger,
as it goes to infinity,
y plus 1 half plus 3 plus 1 quarter,
it just gets bigger.
Okay,
okay,
so,
this series diverges,
even though,
our test that we did,
looking at the infinite term,
which is called the kth term,
of the sequence,
just of the expression was zero,
so it may or may not be convergent,
and we've just shown now,
by a nice trick,
where I represented 1 plus 1 half plus 1 third,
as n is of rectangles,
and I looked at the area under the curve,
and this will beautifully fall on this curve,
1 over x,
because if you substitute the values in there,
you'll get these coordinates,
and I've noticed that my rectangles,
actually overestimate this area under the curve,
therefore s is larger than this,
this goes to infinity in the limit,
therefore this goes to infinity,
and this,
in other words,
diverges.
