This course introduction outlines its focus on common acute surgical conditions, excluding pediatric surgery due to its distinct nature. It targets students interested in acute care surgery as well as practicing doctors dealing with these cases regularly. The course will cover foundational principles rather than a comprehensive review of all topics and is not intended as a universal guide for every situation, emphasizing the importance of both scientific knowledge and practical experience in medicine. Participants are encouraged to heed instructor guidance and consult relevant literature. Lecture one will begin with the topic of an acutely inflamed appendix.
