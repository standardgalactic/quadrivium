The text provides an overview of Taylor's theorem, which is used to approximate functions with polynomials. It requires that a function \( f \) has continuous derivatives up to order \( n+1 \) on a closed interval \([a, b]\), and be differentiable on the open interval \((a, b)\). For any point \( p \) within this interval, Taylor's theorem states that for every \( x \) in the open interval, there exists some value \( c \) between \( x \) and \( p \) such that:

\[ f(x) = T_n(x) + R_n(x), \]

where \( T_n(x) \) is the \( n \)-th order Taylor polynomial at \( p \), and \( R_n(x) \) is the remainder or error term. The Lagrange form of the remainder for a Taylor series expansion to the \( n \)-th degree is given by:

\[ R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x - p)^{n+1}. \]

The text illustrates this with an example of approximating \( f(x) = \ln x \) around \( p = 1 \). The third-order Taylor polynomial is calculated as:

\[ T_3(x) = (x-1) - \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} + \frac{2(x-1)^3}{6}. \]

This example highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate point \( p \) and order for approximation to keep calculations feasible.

To approximate \( \ln(1.03) \), the polynomial is:

\[ 0.03 - \frac{(0.03)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.03)^3}{6}. \]

The error of this approximation is estimated using the Lagrange form of the remainder, which involves the fourth derivative for a third-order polynomial:

\[ R_3(x) = \frac{f^{(4)}(c)(x - p)^4}{4!} \]

For \( f(x) = \ln(x) \), the derivatives are:

- Third derivative: \( 2x^{-3} \)
- Fourth derivative: \( -6x^{-4} \)

The error bound for \( x = 1.03 \) is calculated using values of the fourth derivative between \( c = 1 \) and \( c = 1.03 \):

\[ R_3(1.03) < \frac{|f^{(4)}(c)|(0.03)^4}{24} \]

This provides an interval within which the true value of \( \ln(1.03) \) lies relative to the Taylor polynomial approximation, helping understand potential deviations in the estimate.
