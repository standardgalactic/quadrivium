The video provides an overview of how to approach expanding a rational function where the numerator has a degree lower than the denominator. The specific example involves:

1. A polynomial in the numerator with a degree of 11 and one in the denominator with a degree of 12, confirming that partial fraction decomposition is appropriate.
2. Expanding \( (x + 2)^4 \) into terms such as \( \frac{a_1}{x+2}, \frac{a_2}{(x+2)^2}, \frac{a_3}{(x+2)^3}, \frac{a_4}{(x+2)^4} \).
3. For a second factor involving a quadratic, \( x^2 + 2x + 3 \), it suggests the form \( \frac{b_0x + c_0}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \).
4. A third factor of \( (x^2 + 4)^3 \) should be expanded as \( \frac{b_1x + c_1}{(x^2+4)}, \frac{b_2x + c_2}{(x^2+4)^2}, \frac{b_3x + c_3}{(x^2+4)^3} \).

The goal is to break down the rational function into simpler fractions, making it easier to integrate or analyze. The video aims to reinforce understanding of these decomposition techniques for polynomial expressions in fractional form.
