The video provides an overview of how to approach expanding a rational function where the numerator has a degree lower than the denominator. The specific example involves:

1. A polynomial in the numerator with a degree of 11 and one in the denominator with a degree of 12, confirming that partial fraction decomposition is appropriate.
2. Expanding \( (x + 2)^4 \) into terms such as \( \frac{a_1}{x+2}, \frac{a_2}{(x+2)^2}, \frac{a_3}{(x+2)^3}, \frac{a_4}{(x+2)^4} \).
3. For a second factor involving a quadratic, \( x^2 + 2x + 3 \), it suggests the form \( \frac{b_0x + c_0}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \).
4. A third factor of \( (x^2 + 4)^3 \) should be expanded as \( \frac{b_1x + c_1}{(x^2+4)}, \frac{b_2x + c_2}{(x^2+4)^2}, \frac{b_3x + c_3}{(x^2+4)^3} \).

The goal is to break down the rational function into simpler fractions, making it easier to integrate or analyze. The video aims to reinforce understanding of these decomposition techniques for polynomial expressions in fractional form.

The text describes a process for understanding how to expand a rational function, where the degree of the numerator is 11 and the degree of the denominator is 12. The expansion involves breaking down factors in the denominator into simpler components.

1. **First Factor**: 
   - It includes terms like \( \frac{a_1}{x+2} \), \( \frac{a_2}{(x+2)^2} \), \( \frac{a_3}{(x+2)^3} \), and \( \frac{a_4}{(x+2)^4} \).

2. **Second Factor**:
   - It involves a first-order polynomial in the numerator over \( x^2 + 2x + 3 \), represented as \( \frac{b_0x + c_0}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \).

3. **Third Factor**:
   - Similar to the second, but with \( (x^2 + 4)^3 \) in the denominator, leading to terms like \( \frac{b_1x + c_1}{x^2 + 4^3} \) and \( \frac{b_3x + c_3}{x^2 + 4^3} \).

The purpose of the video is to guide viewers through this expansion process, ensuring they understand how to break down complex rational expressions into simpler parts for easier manipulation or solving. The text suggests using a systematic approach to organize and solve these expansions effectively.
