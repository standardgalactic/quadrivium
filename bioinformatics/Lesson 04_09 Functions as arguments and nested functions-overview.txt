The text explains how to pass functions as arguments in Julia and discusses nested functions. It describes a function called `string_func` that accepts another function (`luv`) as an argument. The `luv` function returns the string "julia," which is inserted into a predefined message, resulting in "I love julia" when printed.

The text also introduces nesting functions by presenting an example where one function (`nest`) contains another. In this case, `nest` multiplies its input by 3 and passes it to the inner function, which further multiplies the result by 3, demonstrating nested execution that results in a final output of 45 when `nest(5)` is called.

Finally, the text hints at exploring "multiple dispatch," a key feature in Julia for handling methods associated with functions.
