The text outlines solving a differential equation where the solution involves terms with powers of \(x\). The author suggests trying a solution of the form \(y = x^m\) and calculates the first and second derivatives. By substituting these into the differential equation, they simplify it to find an equation involving \(m\).

After some algebraic manipulation, they derive a quadratic equation in terms of \(m\): 

\[4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 0.\]

This factors to \((2m + 1)^2 = 0\), giving a repeated root:

\[m = -\frac{1}{2}.\]

Since the roots are repeated, the general solution involves both \(x^{-1/2}\) and an additional term multiplied by the natural logarithm of \(x\) to account for the multiplicity. Thus, the solution takes the form:

\[y = c_1 x^{-1/2} + c_2 x^{-1/2} \ln(x).\]

This combines both terms that arise from the repeated root in solving differential equations with constant coefficients.

The text appears to describe solving a second-order differential equation where the solution involves terms with powers of \( x \). Here's a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: The problem involves finding a particular solution for a differential equation that includes a term involving \( x^2 \).

2. **Assumption**: It is assumed that the solution can be expressed as \( y = x^m \), leading to derivatives \( y' = mx^{m-1} \) and \( y'' = m(m-1)x^{m-2} \).

3. **Substitution and Simplification**: Substituting these expressions into the differential equation results in terms involving powers of \( x \). After simplifying, a quadratic equation in \( m \) is obtained: \( 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 0 \).

4. **Solution for \( m \)**: The quadratic equation factors to \( (2m+1)^2 = 0 \), giving \( m = -\frac{1}{2} \). Since the roots are repeated, a second solution involves multiplying by \( \ln(x) \).

5. **General Solution**: The general solution is expressed as:
   \[
   y = c_1 x^{-\frac{1}{2}} + c_2 x^{-\frac{1}{2}} \ln(x)
   \]

This form accounts for the repeated root by incorporating a logarithmic term in the second solution.
