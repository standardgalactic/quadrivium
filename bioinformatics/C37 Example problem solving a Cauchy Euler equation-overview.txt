The text outlines solving a differential equation where the solution involves terms with powers of \(x\). The author suggests trying a solution of the form \(y = x^m\) and calculates the first and second derivatives. By substituting these into the differential equation, they simplify it to find an equation involving \(m\).

After some algebraic manipulation, they derive a quadratic equation in terms of \(m\): 

\[4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 0.\]

This factors to \((2m + 1)^2 = 0\), giving a repeated root:

\[m = -\frac{1}{2}.\]

Since the roots are repeated, the general solution involves both \(x^{-1/2}\) and an additional term multiplied by the natural logarithm of \(x\) to account for the multiplicity. Thus, the solution takes the form:

\[y = c_1 x^{-1/2} + c_2 x^{-1/2} \ln(x).\]

This combines both terms that arise from the repeated root in solving differential equations with constant coefficients.
