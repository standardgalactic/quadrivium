The text discusses optical instruments, starting with the human eye and its near point (DN) at approximately 25 centimeters, which is the closest distance where objects can be brought into sharp focus. It introduces the concept of angular magnification using a thin lens to form enlarged virtual images when an object is closer than the lens's focal point.

The text then explores practical applications:

1. **Nearsightedness**: For someone who can only see clearly up to 80 centimeters, an image from infinity must be formed at this distance. A diverging (concave) lens with a focal length of -80 cm is needed. The lens's power is calculated as approximately -1.3 diopters.

2. **Farsightedness**: For someone who can only see clearly beyond 75 centimeters, an object placed at 25 cm needs to form an image at least 75 cm away. A converging (convex) lens with a focal length of +37.5 cm is required, resulting in a power of about +2.7 diopters.

3. **Magnifying Lens**: Using a convex lens with a focal distance of 30 cm to project an image from a small object onto a wall 10 meters away, the text describes calculating the magnification and thus the size of the projected image. The process involves using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{SI} = \frac{1}{F} \) to find the object distance \( S_0 \), which then helps determine the image size through magnification calculations.

The text describes a series of calculations related to optics and magnification using lenses. Here's a summary:

1. **Magnification Calculation**: 
   - An object size of 0.31 meters is magnified with a negative SI (image distance) of -10 meters, resulting in a magnification factor of approximately 32 times.
   - The final image size on the wall is calculated to be about 64 cm by 96 cm.

2. **Lens and Film Setup**:
   - A lens setup is described for photographing a distant landscape (considered at infinity). The film must be placed 8 centimeters from the lens, determining the focal length as approximately 8.2 centimeters.

3. **Adjustment for Different Object Distance**:
   - When an object is placed 72 centimeters in front of the lens, calculations are made to find the new image distance (SI). 
   - Using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{SI} \), with a focal length of 8 cm, the new SI is found to be approximately 9 centimeters.
   - The adjustment required is an increase in the distance between the film and the lens by about 1 centimeter.

The text discusses the principles of optical instruments with particular focus on the human eye and lenses used for vision correction and magnification.

1. **Human Eye and Near Point**:
   - The near point (DN) is defined as 25 cm, which is the closest distance at which the average human eye can focus sharply.
   - If an object is closer than this distance, it appears blurred.

2. **Lenses for Magnification**:
   - A thin lens placed before the eye can create a virtual, upright, and enlarged image if the object is within the focal length of the lens.
   - The angular magnification (M) is given by the ratio of angles formed with and without the lens, which equates to DN divided by the focal length (F) of the lens. 
   - Textbooks may provide different formulas for magnification based on whether an object is near or far from the lens.

3. **Vision Correction**:
   - For a near-sighted person who can only focus up to 80 cm, a diverging lens with a focal length of -80 cm (or -0.8 m) and diopters of -1.25 is required.
   - For a far-sighted person able to perceive objects from 75 cm onwards but not at the near point (25 cm), a converging lens with a focal length of +37.5 cm (or +0.375 m) and diopters of +2.67 is needed.

4. **Projector Lens**:
   - A convex lens with a focal distance of 30 cm projects an image from a small object (2 by 3 cm) onto a wall 10 meters away.
   - The magnification calculation involves the distances between the object, lens, and image to determine the size of the projected image.

The text discusses calculations related to optics, specifically involving lenses and magnification. Initially, a magnification calculation is performed using the formula:

\[ \text{Magnification} = \frac{\text{-10 meters}}{0.31 \text{ meters}} \approx -32 \]

This indicates an inverted image that's 32 times larger than the object.

Next, the text describes setting up a lens system for photography with a distant landscape. The film is placed 8 cm from the lens (S_I), which allows us to calculate the focal length of the lens:

\[ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{\infty} + \frac{1}{8 \text{ cm}} \]

Since \( \frac{1}{\infty} \) is 0, the focal length (f) is approximately 8.2 cm.

The problem then shifts to placing an object 72 cm in front of the lens (S_0 = 72 cm). The necessary adjustment for the image distance (S_I) from the lens to form a real inverted image on the film is calculated using:

\[ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{S_I} \]

Substituting the known values, and knowing \( f = 8.2 \text{ cm} \), we solve for S_I to find it's approximately 9 cm.

The adjustment needed is an increase in the distance between the film and the lens by about 1 centimeter to accommodate this new object placement.
