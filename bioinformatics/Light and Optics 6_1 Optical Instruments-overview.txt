The text discusses optical instruments, starting with the human eye and its near point (DN) at approximately 25 centimeters, which is the closest distance where objects can be brought into sharp focus. It introduces the concept of angular magnification using a thin lens to form enlarged virtual images when an object is closer than the lens's focal point.

The text then explores practical applications:

1. **Nearsightedness**: For someone who can only see clearly up to 80 centimeters, an image from infinity must be formed at this distance. A diverging (concave) lens with a focal length of -80 cm is needed. The lens's power is calculated as approximately -1.3 diopters.

2. **Farsightedness**: For someone who can only see clearly beyond 75 centimeters, an object placed at 25 cm needs to form an image at least 75 cm away. A converging (convex) lens with a focal length of +37.5 cm is required, resulting in a power of about +2.7 diopters.

3. **Magnifying Lens**: Using a convex lens with a focal distance of 30 cm to project an image from a small object onto a wall 10 meters away, the text describes calculating the magnification and thus the size of the projected image. The process involves using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{SI} = \frac{1}{F} \) to find the object distance \( S_0 \), which then helps determine the image size through magnification calculations.

The text describes a series of calculations related to optics and magnification using lenses. Here's a summary:

1. **Magnification Calculation**: 
   - An object size of 0.31 meters is magnified with a negative SI (image distance) of -10 meters, resulting in a magnification factor of approximately 32 times.
   - The final image size on the wall is calculated to be about 64 cm by 96 cm.

2. **Lens and Film Setup**:
   - A lens setup is described for photographing a distant landscape (considered at infinity). The film must be placed 8 centimeters from the lens, determining the focal length as approximately 8.2 centimeters.

3. **Adjustment for Different Object Distance**:
   - When an object is placed 72 centimeters in front of the lens, calculations are made to find the new image distance (SI). 
   - Using the lens formula \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{SI} \), with a focal length of 8 cm, the new SI is found to be approximately 9 centimeters.
   - The adjustment required is an increase in the distance between the film and the lens by about 1 centimeter.
