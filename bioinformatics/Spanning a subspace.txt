So let's really cement our understanding of this column space.
So the whole idea is I want to solve this equation,
a system of linear equations, a linear system,
and I solve this by this matrix of coefficients,
my matrix of unknowns, and this solution matrix.
So let's just ask this question of this matrix of coefficients,
and I have 1, 3, 2, and 6, and I'm asking,
you know, what solutions are there in R2?
Clearly, this is going to be in the plane.
It's only in two rows there, so each column vector is 2,
so I can only have 2, and I'm asking what, you know,
what possible solutions can there be in R2?
So remember, there's my X, there's my B.
So what I'm really asking is what linear combinations
of these two column vectors can I have, can I possibly create?
And what I'm suggesting, it's only if B lies inside of that,
those linear combinations, that I could possibly get this.
If B lies outside of the linear combinations of these two,
I will never get this, well, 0, 0, 0.
Anyway, let's just have a look at 1, 2, and 3, and 6.
Notice, though, that 3 and 6 is just 3 times 1 and 2.
So this 1 times 3 is 3, 2 times 3 is 6.
This vector here is already a linear combination of the first one.
I have added nothing to this.
I have added nothing.
It's the exact same vector that I'm dealing with,
so always watch out for that.
So that means I only have this one vector.
If I look, you know, 1 across, 1, 2 up,
that's the only vector that I have.
And that's the vector, that's the vector.
And any linear combination of this vector
will just lie on this infinite line through that vector.
That means that this matrix here
can only have solutions B,
the right-hand side of my linear equations,
that are on this line.
If I'm given any B that is off of this line,
anywhere off of this line,
I cannot get this solution.
That's what we're trying to say.
So the linear combination of these two
will give me this space
that I have to deal with,
the subspace in R2 in this instance.
If it was 3 by 3, it would be bigger.
It needn't be square, remember.
Then, you know, that is the only way
that I could get this solution,
is this better be in the subspace of that.
So the second thing that flows from this little example
is if S is a set of column vectors of A,
so a set of column vectors,
then the linear combination is a subspace in R2
and we call that spanned by S.
So that's another way to look at it.
So imagine I have another vector.
There's our first question there, actually.
What subspace in R2 can I span with A?
And my A's here 1, 2 and 1, 3.
So that's the other way to look at it.
If I'm just given two arbitrary vectors,
say A1 and A2, that's my first one,
and let's make it V1 and V2.
I'm given those two vectors.
I'm asking what subspace in R2,
because this is clearly in R2,
it's not in R3 where there'd be zeros there.
What subspace in R2 can I span with the,
can I create, what subspace in R2 can I create
by linear combinations of these?
Linear combinations of these two will be a subspace,
just as the linear combination of these two
gave me this subspace.
And the only subspace here is this line.
And yesterday we said that that line is a subspace in R2.
So if I look at these, 1 and 2 and 1 and 3,
1 is not a linear combination of the other one.
So the subspace, and if we think of this,
you know, it's 1, 1, 1, 2 and 1, 3,
they lie there.
The subspace, linear combinations of that
will actually give me the whole of R2.
The whole of R2 is the subspace that I can create
in R2 of that.
So that actually spans, and that's what we call,
it spans, if I'm just given two vectors,
it spans a space.
Linear combinations of them span a space.
The second question here, if V, this uppercase V,
is all vectors perpendicular to that vector 1, 2, 1?
Let's just clean the board.
Board is clean, so I'm asking, you know,
vectors perpendicular to that.
Remember when vectors are perpendicular,
so if I have V there, if I have another U,
the dot product of them must be 0.
If the dot product is 0, so that means
anything that I multiply with,
and remember that multiplication is just a,
well, what did we make it?
Let's make it then U transpose V,
so I can write U1, U2, U3 here,
and V1, V2, V3,
and in our instance, let's make that,
let's make that 1, 2, 1.
So I have that U1, so remember this,
there, I'm just going to get a scalar.
So U1 plus twice U2 plus U3 must equal 0.
If that is so, then these two are perpendicular to each other.
So let's look, something times U1 plus 2 of this plus 2.
So I can make this,
what can we make this?
So if we make that a negative 1,
and we make this a 1 and a 1,
so 1 plus 1 is 1,
minus 2 is 0.
So this vector, 1 minus 1, 1.
This vector will definitely be perpendicular to that vector.
If you multiply those together,
you're going to get 0.
So I'm saying V is all the vectors
that are perpendicular to this,
because I can make other vectors that are perpendicular,
suggest a subspace of that.
Well, any line through this one vector
would be a subspace,
so that would always be one of the easy subspaces.
And remember, 0, 0, 0 is also,
there's another subspace for you.
But anything through this line,
1, negative 1, 1,
through that vector would be a subspace.
If V is all the 2 by 2 symmetric matrices,
remember, symmetric matrix is,
I have values on my main diagonal,
and all the values across from that,
so those two and those two,
and these two, they are exactly the same.
So if that's all 2 by 2 symmetric matrices,
so I'll just have two values here,
so as long as they're the same,
that's symmetric matrices,
so just a subspace.
Well, what about just the diagonal matrix?
So if all of these are 0,
and I have one value there,
and I have another value there,
the symmetric,
the diagonal matrix is a subspace,
for instance,
of the symmetric matrices.
And then the last one there,
if V is all polynomials,
F of X,
such that the F prime, prime, prime,
so the third derivative of X equals 0.
So first of all,
let's look at all the polynomials
that will have a third derivative,
which is 0.
So if I have F of X,
and that equals AX squared plus BX plus C,
its first derivative is going to be,
so F prime of X,
just a bit of calculus here,
that's 2AX plus B,
and its second derivative of X,
that is,
it's going to be 2A,
and the third derivative of X
is going to equal 0.
So definitely,
these quadratic,
or to the power 2,
polynomials,
as the set of all polynomials,
suggest a subspace of that.
Well, a subspace of those polynomials,
you know,
just make that even smaller than that.
That would be a subspace
of those polynomials.
So in each of these cases,
you can clearly see what we mean
by this idea of a vector space,
and specifically in the first one,
spanning,
but we can also say
that the subspaces that we created here,
they all span this bigger space,
and the questions that you might just get
is you first have to construct
your original space
that you are dealing with
before you can get to,
so these are just all trick questions,
like this little calculus trick question here,
to do that,
but please understand this idea
then of a space,
the subspace,
how to,
if you've given some vectors,
you can span a subspace,
and,
you know,
those where we had,
especially where we had
that one is already
a linear combination of the other,
watch out for those.
So I think by now,
you have a pretty idea
of how,
what we are trying to,
trying to achieve here,
is when can we get a solution here,
most definitely if B
is in the subspace
created by a linear combination
of the column space of A.
