The text provides an intuitive explanation of multivariable calculus concepts by drawing analogies to familiar single-variable calculus and geometrical visualizations. It starts with the idea of a function \( f(x) \), which is typically understood as a curve in two-dimensional space (x, y-plane). When extended to two variables, \( f(x, y) \), it becomes a surface in three-dimensional space.

The visualization involves imagining this surface as a blanket or dome suspended in the air. In three dimensions, with axes x, y, and z, any function \( z = f(x, y) \) describes how each (x, y) pair maps to a specific height (z-value), forming a surface.

To further understand this surface, we can consider cross-sections by intersecting it with planes. One example is slicing the dome with a plane parallel to the y-z axis at \( x = a \). This intersection forms a curve in the y-z plane, known as the "y-z profile." Similarly, slicing with a plane parallel to the x-z axis at \( y = b \) creates an "x-z profile."

These profiles help visualize how changing one variable while holding another constant affects the function's output. The first partial derivatives represent the rate of change along these profiles, analogous to slopes in single-variable calculus. Specifically:
- \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \) is the slope of the tangent line to the curve where \( y = b \), indicating how z changes with x.
- \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) is the slope of the tangent line to the curve where \( x = a \), showing how z changes with y.

The second partial derivatives provide information about the curvature of these profiles. In summary, understanding multivariable functions involves imagining their graphical representations in three-dimensional space and analyzing slices or cross-sections to gain insights into their behavior.

The text discusses how points in space can be represented as vectors and mentions different ways this representation appears in textbooks. Specifically, it describes a point \((a, b)\) which is part of the domain \(f\), such that when evaluated, \(f(a, b) = c\). The text also explains partial derivatives at this point: the first partial derivative represents the rate of change of the function \(f(x, y, z)\) with respect to \(x\), while the second partial derivative indicates the rate of change of \(z\) with respect to \(y\) at the given point \((a, b)\).
