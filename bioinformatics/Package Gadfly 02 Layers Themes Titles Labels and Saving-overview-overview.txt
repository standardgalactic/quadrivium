The provided text outlines using the `ggplot2` package in R for creating customized layered plots, focusing on various enhancements through themes and aesthetics. Key points include:

1. **Layering**: Plots are constructed layer by layer, allowing each to have distinct data or aesthetics for complex visualizations.
   
2. **Customization with Themes**:
   - Global plot settings like grid line colors and background can be modified using the `theme` function.
   - Specific layers can also be customized within their respective functions.

3. **Aesthetic Adjustments**: 
   - Customize plot components such as point size, line width, and colors using aesthetic parameters.
   - Default element colors can be set with `colorant`.

4. **Adding Legends**:
   - Use `guide.manual` to add legends with specified text and colors.

5. **Titles and Labels**:
   - Titles and axis labels are added with `guide.title`, `guide.xlabel`, and `guide.ylabel`.

6. **Grid Line Customization**: 
   - Grid lines can be customized or hidden by adjusting their color or size through the `grid.color` argument in themes.

Additionally, while not detailed in this excerpt, it mentions saving plots from a Jupyter Notebook using iJulia.

The text also briefly introduces plotting functionalities in Julia. It discusses saving plots with the Cairo package and specifies file names and sizes for PNG files. Nothing is displayed until saved or shown in Julia Box. Gadfly can plot data directly from DataFrames, indicating its data-aware capabilities. The intention to import a DataFrame in the following section suggests further exploration of Julia's plotting features.
