It looks like you're working through a process to find the inverse of a matrix \( A \) using its cofactor matrix and then multiplying it by another matrix \( B \). Let's break down the steps and clarify the process:

1. **Matrix \( A \):**
   - You start with a 3x3 matrix \( A \).

2. **Determinant:**
   - Calculate the determinant of \( A \), which you've found to be 5.

3. **Cofactor Matrix:**
   - Construct the cofactor matrix of \( A \). This involves calculating the minors for each element, applying a checkerboard pattern of signs (positive and negative), and then forming a matrix from these values.
   - You have provided the cofactor matrix as:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     3 & -5 & -4 \\
     -1 & 5 & 3 \\
     4 & -5 & -2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

4. **Adjoint (or Adjugate) Matrix:**
   - The adjoint of \( A \) is the transpose of its cofactor matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     3 & -1 & 4 \\
     -5 & 5 & -5 \\
     -4 & 3 & -2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

5. **Inverse of \( A \):**
   - The inverse of \( A \) is given by:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \times \text{adjoint}(A)
     \]
   - Substituting the determinant and adjoint, you get:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{bmatrix}
     3 & -1 & 4 \\
     -5 & 5 & -5 \\
     -4 & 3 & -2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{3}{5} & -\frac{1}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \\
     -1 & 1 & -1 \\
     -\frac{4}{5} & \frac{3}{5} & -\frac{2}{5}
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

6. **Multiplying \( A^{-1} \) by \( B \):**
   - You have matrix \( B \):
     \[
     B = \begin{bmatrix}
     -5 & 4 \\
     -3 & -5 \\
     6 & ?
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Multiply \( A^{-1} \) by \( B \) to find the resulting matrix, which should give you a column vector \( x \).

7. **Result:**
   - You expect the result of this multiplication to be:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 3 \\
     4 & ?
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - This implies that the last element in matrix \( B \) and the second row, second column of the resulting product should match accordingly.

This process allows you to solve for \( x \) when \( A \times x = B \), by computing \( x = A^{-1} \times B \). Make sure each step is verified, especially the calculations involving determinants and cofactors, as errors in these can lead to incorrect results.
