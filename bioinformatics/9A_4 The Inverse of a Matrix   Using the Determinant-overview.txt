It looks like you're working through a process to find the inverse of a matrix \( A \) using its cofactor matrix and then multiplying it by another matrix \( B \). Let's break down the steps and clarify the process:

1. **Matrix \( A \):**
   - You start with a 3x3 matrix \( A \).

2. **Determinant:**
   - Calculate the determinant of \( A \), which you've found to be 5.

3. **Cofactor Matrix:**
   - Construct the cofactor matrix of \( A \). This involves calculating the minors for each element, applying a checkerboard pattern of signs (positive and negative), and then forming a matrix from these values.
   - You have provided the cofactor matrix as:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     3 & -5 & -4 \\
     -1 & 5 & 3 \\
     4 & -5 & -2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

4. **Adjoint (or Adjugate) Matrix:**
   - The adjoint of \( A \) is the transpose of its cofactor matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     3 & -1 & 4 \\
     -5 & 5 & -5 \\
     -4 & 3 & -2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

5. **Inverse of \( A \):**
   - The inverse of \( A \) is given by:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \times \text{adjoint}(A)
     \]
   - Substituting the determinant and adjoint, you get:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{bmatrix}
     3 & -1 & 4 \\
     -5 & 5 & -5 \\
     -4 & 3 & -2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{3}{5} & -\frac{1}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \\
     -1 & 1 & -1 \\
     -\frac{4}{5} & \frac{3}{5} & -\frac{2}{5}
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

6. **Multiplying \( A^{-1} \) by \( B \):**
   - You have matrix \( B \):
     \[
     B = \begin{bmatrix}
     -5 & 4 \\
     -3 & -5 \\
     6 & ?
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Multiply \( A^{-1} \) by \( B \) to find the resulting matrix, which should give you a column vector \( x \).

7. **Result:**
   - You expect the result of this multiplication to be:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 3 \\
     4 & ?
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - This implies that the last element in matrix \( B \) and the second row, second column of the resulting product should match accordingly.

This process allows you to solve for \( x \) when \( A \times x = B \), by computing \( x = A^{-1} \times B \). Make sure each step is verified, especially the calculations involving determinants and cofactors, as errors in these can lead to incorrect results.

Let's break down the process of finding the inverse of a matrix and verifying it by multiplying with another matrix. The steps involved are:

1. **Find the Determinant**: 
   - For a 3x3 matrix \( A \), the determinant can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{det}(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)
     \]
   - Here, \( A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{bmatrix} \).

2. **Find the Matrix of Cofactors**:
   - Calculate the cofactor for each element in the matrix.
   - The cofactor \( C_{ij} \) is given by \( (-1)^{i+j} \times M_{ij} \), where \( M_{ij} \) is the minor of element \( a_{ij} \).

3. **Find the Adjoint (Transpose of the Matrix of Cofactors)**:
   - Transpose the matrix of cofactors to get the adjoint.

4. **Calculate the Inverse**:
   - The inverse \( A^{-1} \) is given by:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \times \text{adjoint}(A)
     \]

5. **Verify by Multiplying with Another Matrix**:
   - Multiply the inverse matrix \( A^{-1} \) by another matrix \( B \).
   - Check if the result matches the expected outcome (e.g., identity matrix or a specific vector).

Let's apply these steps to your example:

### Given Matrices

Matrix \( A \):
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 & 4 \\ 2 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Matrix \( B \):
\[
B = \begin{bmatrix} -5 & 4 & 6 \\ -3 & -5 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate the Determinant of \( A \)**:
   \[
   \text{det}(A) = 3(5 \times 9 - 6 \times 8) - 1(2 \times 9 - 6 \times 7) + 4(2 \times 8 - 5 \times 7)
   \]
   \[
   = 3(45 - 48) - 1(18 - 42) + 4(16 - 35)
   \]
   \[
   = 3(-3) - 1(-24) + 4(-19)
   \]
   \[
   = -9 + 24 - 76 = -61
   \]

2. **Find the Matrix of Cofactors**:
   - Calculate each cofactor and form the matrix.

3. **Transpose to Get the Adjoint**:
   - Transpose the matrix of cofactors obtained in step 2.

4. **Calculate the Inverse**:
   \[
   A^{-1} = \frac{1}{-61} \times \text{adjoint}(A)
   \]

5. **Verify by Multiplying \( A^{-1} \) with \( B \)**:
   - Perform matrix multiplication to verify if the result matches the expected outcome.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can find the inverse of a matrix and verify it through multiplication. The determinant plays a crucial role in determining whether an inverse exists (non-zero determinant) and in calculating the inverse itself.
