The provided text outlines a method for solving a system of linear equations using matrix inverses, specifically focusing on the following steps:

1. **Setup**: Two linear equations are given:
   - \( 1x + 2y = 8 \)
   - \( 2x - y = 1 \)

   These can be represented in augmented matrix form as:
   
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 2 & | & 8 \\
   2 & -1 & | & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. **Matrix Representation**: 
   - The coefficient matrix \( A \) is:

     \[
     A = \begin{bmatrix} 
     1 & 2 \\ 
     2 & -1 
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

   - The unknowns are in vector form:
     
     \[
     x = \begin{bmatrix} 
     x \\ 
     y 
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

   - The solution vector \( b \) is:

     \[
     b = \begin{bmatrix} 
     8 \\ 
     1 
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Matrix Equation**: The system is expressed as:
   
   \[ 
   A \times x = b
   \]

4. **Finding the Inverse**: To solve for \( x \), compute the inverse of matrix \( A \) (\( A^{-1} \)), allowing us to find:

   \[
   x = A^{-1} \times b
   \]

5. **Methods for Finding the Inverse**:
   - The text discusses using elementary row operations to transform \( A \) into an identity matrix, with the inverse appearing on the augmented side.
   - Alternatively, software like Mathematica can compute \( A^{-1} \).

6. **Example Calculation**: 
   - For \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \), its inverse is found to be:

     \[
     A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{1}{5} & \frac{2}{5} \\
     -\frac{1}{5} & \frac{1}{5} 
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

7. **Solution**: Multiplying \( A^{-1} \) by vector \( b \), the solution for the variables is determined:

   \[
   x = 2, \quad y = 3
   \]

8. **Conclusion**: The text emphasizes that matrix inverses provide an elegant method to solve systems of linear equations, with software tools like Mathematica simplifying the inverse calculation and solution process.
