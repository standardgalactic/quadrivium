The text outlines a method for solving differential equations related to oscillatory motion using an auxiliary equation. Here's a summary:

1. **Setting up the Equation**: The problem starts by setting \( x = 0 \) and using constants \( k = 8 \) (spring constant) and \( m = 2 \, \text{kg} \) (mass), leading to the auxiliary equation with roots related to oscillation: \( m^2 + 4 = 0 \).

2. **Finding Roots**: Solving for \( m \), we find complex roots \( m_1 = 2i \) and \( m_2 = -2i \). These roots indicate oscillatory motion, where the general solution is expressed in terms of sine and cosine functions.

3. **General Solution**: The position function \( x(t) \) can be written as:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 \cos(2t) + c_2 \sin(2t)
   \]
   where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are determined by initial conditions.

4. **Alternative Expression**: The solution is often expressed in a more physical form:
   \[
   x(t) = A \cos(2t - \phi)
   \]
   where \( A \) is the amplitude and \( \phi \) is the phase angle, derived using initial conditions.

5. **Determining Amplitude and Phase**:
   - The amplitude \( A \) is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: 
     \[
     A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2}
     \]
   - The phase angle \( \phi \) is found using:
     \[
     \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{c_2}{c_1}\right)
     \]

6. **Special Cases**: If \( c_2 = 0 \), the motion starts from rest at a maximum or minimum displacement.

7. **Caution with Phase Angle**: When calculating \( \phi \), care must be taken to consider the correct quadrant of the angle, especially when dealing with negative values for \( c_1 \) and/or \( c_2 \).

This approach allows for the analysis of simple harmonic motion using initial conditions to determine specific characteristics like amplitude and phase.

The text discusses calculating an angle \(\phi\) using trigonometric functions in the context of oscillatory motion, like that seen in a spring. It highlights that \(\phi\) is determined by taking \(\pi\) minus the inverse tangent (arctangent) of 1. The caution here is to ensure accuracy when solving these problems, as it's easy to make mistakes and get an incorrect value for \(\phi\). This approach helps express the answer in a form consistent with oscillatory motion analysis, such as spring movement, tying together mathematical expressions seamlessly.
