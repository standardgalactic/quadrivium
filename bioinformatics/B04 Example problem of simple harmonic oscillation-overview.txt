The text outlines a method for solving differential equations related to oscillatory motion using an auxiliary equation. Here's a summary:

1. **Setting up the Equation**: The problem starts by setting \( x = 0 \) and using constants \( k = 8 \) (spring constant) and \( m = 2 \, \text{kg} \) (mass), leading to the auxiliary equation with roots related to oscillation: \( m^2 + 4 = 0 \).

2. **Finding Roots**: Solving for \( m \), we find complex roots \( m_1 = 2i \) and \( m_2 = -2i \). These roots indicate oscillatory motion, where the general solution is expressed in terms of sine and cosine functions.

3. **General Solution**: The position function \( x(t) \) can be written as:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 \cos(2t) + c_2 \sin(2t)
   \]
   where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are determined by initial conditions.

4. **Alternative Expression**: The solution is often expressed in a more physical form:
   \[
   x(t) = A \cos(2t - \phi)
   \]
   where \( A \) is the amplitude and \( \phi \) is the phase angle, derived using initial conditions.

5. **Determining Amplitude and Phase**:
   - The amplitude \( A \) is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: 
     \[
     A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2}
     \]
   - The phase angle \( \phi \) is found using:
     \[
     \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{c_2}{c_1}\right)
     \]

6. **Special Cases**: If \( c_2 = 0 \), the motion starts from rest at a maximum or minimum displacement.

7. **Caution with Phase Angle**: When calculating \( \phi \), care must be taken to consider the correct quadrant of the angle, especially when dealing with negative values for \( c_1 \) and/or \( c_2 \).

This approach allows for the analysis of simple harmonic motion using initial conditions to determine specific characteristics like amplitude and phase.

The text discusses calculating an angle \(\phi\) using trigonometric functions in the context of oscillatory motion, like that seen in a spring. It highlights that \(\phi\) is determined by taking \(\pi\) minus the inverse tangent (arctangent) of 1. The caution here is to ensure accuracy when solving these problems, as it's easy to make mistakes and get an incorrect value for \(\phi\). This approach helps express the answer in a form consistent with oscillatory motion analysis, such as spring movement, tying together mathematical expressions seamlessly.

The text provides a detailed explanation of solving a specific type of differential equation related to oscillatory motion. Here’s a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: The problem involves an oscillating mass-spring system described by the equation \( k/m \cdot x = -4 \). Given constants are \( k = 8 \) and \( m = 2 \, \text{kg} \).

2. **Auxiliary Equation**: Using \( m \), not as mass but in a differential equation context, leads to an auxiliary equation resulting in complex roots: \( m_1 = +2i \) and \( m_2 = -2i \). This indicates oscillatory motion.

3. **General Solution**: The solution for the position \( x(t) \) of the mass over time is expressed as:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 \cos(2t) + c_2 \sin(2t)
   \]
   where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants determined by initial conditions.

4. **Alternative Form**: The solution can also be expressed in a more physically intuitive form:
   \[
   x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
   \]
   where \( A \) is the amplitude, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency (2 in this case), and \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

5. **Determining Constants**: Initial conditions help determine \( c_1 \), \( c_2 \), \( A \), and \( \phi \). If there’s no initial velocity, \( c_2 = 0 \).

6. **Geometric Interpretation**: The solution can be visualized geometrically using a circle with radius equal to the amplitude. The constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) relate to coordinates on this circle.

7. **Phase Angle Calculation**: The phase angle \( \phi \) is calculated using:
   \[
   \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{c_2}{c_1}\right)
   \]
   Special care is needed when calculating angles, especially if the initial position or velocity affects the quadrant of \( \phi \).

This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of oscillatory motion in a mass-spring system using differential equations.

The text discusses calculating an angle \(\phi\) using inverse trigonometric functions in the context of oscillatory motion. Specifically, it states that \(\phi\) is equal to \(\pi\) minus the inverse tangent of 1 (\(\tan^{-1}(1)\)). This calculation requires careful attention because errors can easily occur when determining \(\phi\). The expression for \(\phi\) in this form is preferred because it aligns with how oscillatory motion, like spring motion, is typically represented mathematically. The text emphasizes the importance of accuracy in solving such problems and notes that the mathematics involved connects well with the principles of oscillation.
