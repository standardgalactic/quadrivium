The text discusses solving a differential equation that initially appears as an exact form but isn't. The author examines the condition for exactness by checking if the partial derivatives \(\frac{\partial m}{\partial y}\) and \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial x}\) are equal, which they are not in this case (\(2y\) vs \(2x - y\)). 

The next step considers using an integrating factor to make it exact. The two potential integrating factors involve functions of \(x\) or \(y\) alone; however, neither applies here as the required conditions aren't met.

The text then shifts focus to identifying the equation as a homogeneous differential equation. By substituting \(tx\) and \(ty\), both \(m(tx, ty)\) and \(n(tx, ty)\) simplify to forms involving \(t^2\), confirming homogeneity since they equal \(t^\alpha m(x, y)\) with \(\alpha = 2\).

For solving, the text suggests using substitutions suitable for homogeneous equations: either \(y = ux\) or \(x = vy\). The decision is based on which function (\(m\) or \(n\)) appears simpler. Here, \(m(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\) and \(n(x, y) = x^2 + xy\) are compared, with \(m(x, y)\) deemed simpler due to fewer mixed terms.

The substitution \(y = ux\) is chosen for its simplicity, transforming the equation into a potentially solvable form involving \(u\). If this approach fails, the alternative substitution can be attempted.

The text describes a process of solving a differential equation involving the variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(u\). The original equation is given as:

\[ x^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = 0. \]

A substitution is made where \( y = ux \), leading to the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} = u + x\frac{du}{dx} \).

The text then moves on to express this in differential form:

\[ d(y) = (u + x \frac{du}{dx}) dx. \]

This simplifies further using substitution and algebraic manipulation into a new equation involving differentials \( du \) and \( dx \):

\[ x^2 du + u(x^2 du + dx) = 0, \]

which can be rearranged to isolate terms involving \( dx \) and \( du \).

The goal is to simplify this expression to separate the variables for easier integration or solution. The process involves algebraic manipulation to achieve a form where differentials of each variable are isolated. While the text briefly mentions differential forms as an advanced topic, it focuses on solving the equation using basic substitution and differentiation techniques.

The text outlines the process of differentiating and simplifying an expression involving variables \(x\) and \(u\). The key steps involve:

1. Differentiation: 
   - Terms like \(D x\), \(U x^3\), \(D u\), \(U^2\), and \(X^2\) are differentiated with respect to their variables.
   
2. Combining Like Terms:
   - After differentiation, terms involving \(x\) such as \(x^2\), \(u^2 x^2\), and \(ux^2\) are combined.

3. Handling Signs:
   - Attention is paid to correctly applying negative signs where necessary, with a specific focus on ensuring that negative signs are not mistakenly omitted.

4. Simplification:
   - The expression is simplified by grouping similar terms together.
   
5. Final Expression:
   - The final simplified expression involves terms like \(u^2 x\), \(ux^2\), and \(- u^2 x\).
   - For the derivative with respect to \(u\) (\(du\)), terms such as \(x^3\) and \(- ux^3\) are included.

The text emphasizes careful attention to detail, particularly regarding signs, to avoid errors in simplification.

The text describes a mathematical process involving algebraic manipulation and substitution. The speaker starts with an expression containing \( x^2 \) and \( u \cdot x^2 \), factoring out \( x^2 \) to simplify it. They aim to separate variables in the equation by dividing through by \( x^3 \). This results in a form where they can isolate terms involving \( u \). The ultimate goal is to rearrange the equation to facilitate variable separation, leading to an expression with \( 1 - u \cdot D(x) / (x + 1) = -1 / (x + u) \), allowing for further analysis or solving.

The text describes the process of simplifying an integral expression through algebraic manipulation. The author begins by addressing the components of a fraction, specifically the numerator and denominator. They decide to make the problem simpler by factoring out a negative sign.

Since substitution is deemed ineffective for solving this integral, long division is suggested as the next step. Using \( U \) in the division process with \( U + 1 \) as the divisor, they find that the quotient is 1 and the remainder is -1. This leads to an expression of \(-\frac{1}{U+1}\).

To check their work, they rewrite this with a common denominator, finding that the negative terms cancel out, returning them to \(\frac{U}{U+1}\). Thus, the simplified result of the integral is expressed as:

\[ \int \left( 1 - \frac{1}{U+1} \right) dU. \]

This simplifies further to:

\[ U - \ln|U+1| + C, \]

where \( C \) is the constant of integration. The author emphasizes that through these steps, the original integral has been simplified significantly.

The text describes a mathematical process involving algebraic manipulation and integration. Initially, it mentions dividing terms resulting in "two over one plus U minus one." The speaker then performs long division on an expression related to the variables \( D \) and \( x \), simplifying it further.

Next, they take the indefinite integral of both sides of a derived equation, leading to an expression involving natural logarithms. After integrating, the result is expressed as:

\[ 2 \times \ln|1 + U| - U = -\ln|x| + C_1. \]

Using properties of logarithms and exponentiation, this simplifies further to:

\[ (1 + U)^2 \cdot e^{-U} = x^{-1} \cdot e^{C_1}. \]

Finally, with the substitution \( U = \frac{Y}{X} \), the equation becomes:

\[ 1 + \left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)^2. \]

The text outlines a series of steps involving algebraic manipulation, integration, and simplification using logarithmic properties to arrive at this final expression.

The text describes a mathematical problem involving exponential and rational expressions. Initially, an equation is presented as \( e^{-\frac{y}{x}} = e^y \cdot x^{-y} \). The goal is to simplify or solve this expression further.

Steps taken in the simplification process include:

1. Manipulating the initial equation into a form that involves simpler rational expressions.
2. Attempting various algebraic manipulations, including multiplying terms and clearing denominators by multiplying both sides of an equation by \( x \).
3. Simplifying to reach a more manageable expression: \( C_2 e^y/x = \text{some constant} \times x \).

The process illustrates attempts at simplification through multiplication and manipulation of exponents, leading to a neater form. The text reflects ongoing efforts to refine the equation into its simplest form while acknowledging the complexity and lengthiness of solving such problems.

The text emphasizes the importance of following certain steps to solve mathematical problems, particularly those involving integrals. Key points include using an integrating factor and substitution (specifically \( y = u \cdot x \)) to make equations exact for easier integration. The process involves basic calculus techniques learned in first-year courses, focusing on handling challenging integrals. Although the text is somewhat repetitive, it underscores a methodical approach to solving differential equations by making them exact.
