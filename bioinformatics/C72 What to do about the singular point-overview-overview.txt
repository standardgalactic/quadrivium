The text discusses how to identify and classify singular points in second-order linear differential equations, focusing on distinguishing between regular and irregular singular points. Hereâ€™s a concise summary:

1. **Singular Points**: These occur where the coefficients of the differential equation are not defined or become infinite. 

2. **Regular vs. Irregular Singular Points**:
   - A point \( x = x_0 \) is a **regular singular point** if, after transforming the original coefficients by multiplying with \( (x-x_0) \) and \( (x-x_0)^2 \), the resulting functions are analytical at \( x_0 \).
   - If these transformed functions are not analytical, the point is an **irregular singular point**.

3. **Example Analysis**: The differential equation given is:
   \[
   (x^2 - 4)y'' + 3xy' + 5y = 0
   \]
   Singular points occur where \( x^2 - 4 = 0 \), i.e., at \( x = \pm 2 \). The nature of these singularities is determined by checking the analyticity of transformed coefficients around these points.

4. **Analyticity Check**:
   - Construct functions \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) from the differential equation.
   - Ensure they remain finite (analytical) at potential singular points to classify them as regular singular points.

5. **Conclusion**: The text provides a method for classifying singular points, essential for solving differential equations near these points. Regular singular points allow for certain solution techniques, while irregular ones require more complex analysis.

This approach helps in understanding the behavior of solutions near singularities and is crucial for further mathematical or physical applications involving differential equations.
