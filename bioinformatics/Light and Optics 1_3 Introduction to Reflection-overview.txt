Let's break down the physics problems described:

### Problem 1: Plane Mirror with Incident Ray

**Scenario:** An incident ray strikes a plane mirror with an angle of incidence \( i \). The mirror is then rotated by an angle \( \theta \).

#### Key Concepts:
- **Law of Reflection:** The angle of incidence (\( i \)) equals the angle of reflection.
- **Effect of Mirror Rotation:** When a mirror rotates through an angle \( \theta \), the reflected ray rotates through an angle \( 2\theta \). This is because both the incident and reflected angles change by \( \theta \).

#### Solution:
1. **Initial Reflection:**
   - Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection = \( i \).

2. **After Rotation:**
   - The mirror rotates by \( \theta \).
   - The angle of incidence becomes \( i + \theta \).
   - The new angle of reflection is also \( i + \theta \).
   - Therefore, the reflected ray rotates by \( 2\theta \).

### Problem 2: Concave Mirror and Image Formation

**Scenario:** An object is placed at a distance \( S_0 = 3.0 \) meters from a concave mirror with focal length \( f = 1.0 \) meter.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Mirror Equation:** 
  \[
  \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{S_0}
  \]
  where \( S_i \) is the image distance.
  
- **Magnification (\( m \)):**
  \[
  m = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} = \frac{Y_i}{Y_0}
  \]
  where \( Y_i \) and \( Y_0 \) are the heights of the image and object, respectively.

#### Solution:
1. **Calculate Image Distance (\( S_i \)):**
   - Use the mirror equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{1} = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{3}
     \]
     \[
     1 = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{3}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{S_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
     \[
     S_i = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ meters (on the same side as the object, real image)}
     \]

2. **Calculate Magnification:**
   - Using \( m = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} \):
     \[
     m = -\frac{1.5}{3} = -0.5
     \]
   - The negative sign indicates the image is inverted.

3. **Image Height (\( Y_i \)):**
   - Given \( Y_0 = 0.05 \) meters:
     \[
     Y_i = m \times Y_0 = -0.5 \times 0.05 = -0.025 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - The image is inverted and smaller than the object.

### Conclusion:
- **Plane Mirror:** The reflected ray rotates by \( 2\theta \) when the mirror rotates by \( \theta \).
- **Concave Mirror:** The image forms at 1.5 meters from the mirror, is real, inverted, and half the size of the object.

Let's break down the problem into two parts: the mirror reflection scenario and the concave mirror image formation.

### Part 1: Mirror Reflection

You have a plane mirror initially perpendicular to the ground. When you tilt it by an angle \(\theta\), the direction of light changes due to the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - A ray of light strikes the mirror perpendicularly and reflects back on itself.
   
2. **After Tilting**:
   - When the mirror is tilted by an angle \(\theta\), the normal to the surface also tilts by \(\theta\).
   - The incident ray, initially perpendicular, now makes an angle \(\theta\) with the new normal.
   - By the law of reflection, the reflected ray will also make an angle \(\theta\) with the normal but on the opposite side.

3. **Change in Direction**:
   - The total change in direction of the light ray is \(2\theta\) because both the incident and reflected angles have shifted by \(\theta\).

### Part 2: Concave Mirror Image Formation

For a concave mirror, you want to find where an object placed at a certain distance forms an image.

1. **Given**:
   - Radius of curvature \(R = -4\) meters (negative because it's a concave mirror).
   - Focal length \(f = \frac{R}{2} = -2\) meters.
   - Object distance \(S_0 = 3\) meters.

2. **Mirror Equation**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{S_0}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{-2} = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{3}
   \]

3. **Solve for \(S_i\)**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{S_i} = \frac{1}{-2} - \frac{1}{3} = -\frac{3}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = -\frac{5}{6}
   \]
   \[
   S_i = -\frac{6}{5} = -1.2 \text{ meters}
   \]

4. **Image Characteristics**:
   - The negative sign indicates the image is formed on the same side as the object, meaning it's a real image.
   - Magnification \(M\) is given by:
     \[
     M = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} = -\frac{-1.2}{3} = 0.4
     \]
   - The positive magnification indicates the image is upright relative to the inverted object.

5. **Image Size**:
   - If the object height \(Y_0 = 0.05\) meters, then the image height \(Y_i\) is:
     \[
     Y_i = M \times Y_0 = 0.4 \times 0.05 = 0.02 \text{ meters}
     \]

### Conclusion

- The change in direction of the light ray after tilting the mirror by \(\theta\) is \(2\theta\).
- For the concave mirror, the image is formed 1.2 meters from the mirror on the same side as the object (real and inverted), with a size of 0.02 meters, which is smaller than the object.
