Let's break down the physics problems described:

### Problem 1: Plane Mirror with Incident Ray

**Scenario:** An incident ray strikes a plane mirror with an angle of incidence \( i \). The mirror is then rotated by an angle \( \theta \).

#### Key Concepts:
- **Law of Reflection:** The angle of incidence (\( i \)) equals the angle of reflection.
- **Effect of Mirror Rotation:** When a mirror rotates through an angle \( \theta \), the reflected ray rotates through an angle \( 2\theta \). This is because both the incident and reflected angles change by \( \theta \).

#### Solution:
1. **Initial Reflection:**
   - Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection = \( i \).

2. **After Rotation:**
   - The mirror rotates by \( \theta \).
   - The angle of incidence becomes \( i + \theta \).
   - The new angle of reflection is also \( i + \theta \).
   - Therefore, the reflected ray rotates by \( 2\theta \).

### Problem 2: Concave Mirror and Image Formation

**Scenario:** An object is placed at a distance \( S_0 = 3.0 \) meters from a concave mirror with focal length \( f = 1.0 \) meter.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Mirror Equation:** 
  \[
  \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{S_0}
  \]
  where \( S_i \) is the image distance.
  
- **Magnification (\( m \)):**
  \[
  m = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} = \frac{Y_i}{Y_0}
  \]
  where \( Y_i \) and \( Y_0 \) are the heights of the image and object, respectively.

#### Solution:
1. **Calculate Image Distance (\( S_i \)):**
   - Use the mirror equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{1} = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{3}
     \]
     \[
     1 = \frac{1}{S_i} + \frac{1}{3}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{S_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
     \[
     S_i = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ meters (on the same side as the object, real image)}
     \]

2. **Calculate Magnification:**
   - Using \( m = -\frac{S_i}{S_0} \):
     \[
     m = -\frac{1.5}{3} = -0.5
     \]
   - The negative sign indicates the image is inverted.

3. **Image Height (\( Y_i \)):**
   - Given \( Y_0 = 0.05 \) meters:
     \[
     Y_i = m \times Y_0 = -0.5 \times 0.05 = -0.025 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - The image is inverted and smaller than the object.

### Conclusion:
- **Plane Mirror:** The reflected ray rotates by \( 2\theta \) when the mirror rotates by \( \theta \).
- **Concave Mirror:** The image forms at 1.5 meters from the mirror, is real, inverted, and half the size of the object.
