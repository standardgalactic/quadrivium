Now that we know what the derivative of the tangent of x and the secant of x are, we need to look at the integral of the tangent of x and the secant of x.
Now the tangent of x is quite simple. Let's look at that.
What is the indefinite integral of the tangent of x with respect to x?
We can immediately, or the first inclination would be to rewrite tangent as the sine of x divided by the cosine of x with respect to x.
Now we need to get rid of, if we are going to use u substitution, let's get rid of the sine x dx.
Is there anything we can let u be? So when we take the derivative of u that we are left with the sine x, yes.
And fortunately for us, that vector appears in our problem and there it is, the cosine of x.
So let u be the cosine of x. If we then take du dx, that is negative the sine of x.
And we have the fact that negative du is going to be the sine of x dx.
And that is what we need to get rid of.
So if we do rewrite this, the sine of x dx can be written as negative 1 du.
And 1 over the cosine of x, well the cosine of x is going to be u.
From our properties of integrals we can bring the constant out.
So that will be negative 1 that we brought out.
1 over u with respect to u and we know what that is.
Negative the natural log of the absolute value of u plus c.
And if we substitute back our value of u, we get negative the natural log of the absolute value of the cosine of x plus c.
So the indefinite integral of the tangent of x with respect to x is quite easy.
That is negative the natural log of the absolute value of cosine of x plus c.
Let's get some more space.
Now for a much more difficult problem.
A much more difficult problem.
Let us look at the indefinite integral of the secant of x with respect to x.
Now before we tackle that problem, or just substituting secant of x as 1 over the cosine of x is not going to help us here.
We are going to have to use a very clever method of lateral thinking.
And just follow with me.
If I look at the derivative with respect to x.
I don't know why I am writing it there.
Let's carry on here.
Let us look at the derivative with respect to x of the tangent of x plus the secant of x.
Well you are going to say that is quite easy.
Let us do separate problems.
What is the first derivative of the tangent of x?
Well we have looked at it in the previous video.
That is secant squared of x.
And what is the derivative with respect to x of the secant of x?
Well that is secant of x tangent of x.
Or tangent of x secant of x.
I can take out a common factor there.
The secant of x.
And that is going to leave me secant of x plus tangent of x.
Now look at something quite unique here.
If I call, and I am going to use colors so you can see what I mean.
If I call tangent of x plus secant of x.
If I call that u.
See that that appears in my answer.
That would also be u.
And the first derivative of this u.
I have taken the d dx.
I will make it pink.
That is u prime.
And that is our answer here.
u prime.
Now, if I let u equal secant of x plus the tangent of x.
What is u prime?
Well, remember I have just said u equals.
So, if you look up here.
I am just going to rewrite that.
In other words I am asking the d dx of u.
Here is our d dx and here is our u.
So, u prime is going to be this bigger answer on this side.
It contains a secant of x and it contains u itself.
So, that is going to equal u times the secant of x.
Or, the secant of x equals u prime over u.
That is actually quite neat.
Now, there is something called the logarithmic derivative.
And let me change colors.
That says u prime over u equals the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of u.
And there is a way that we can use implicit differentiation.
To get to this logarithmic derivative.
And let me show you how.
So, if we just take.
Let's remain in this color.
And we are going to work back.
If we take through implicit differentiation.
The d dx of the natural log of u.
So, it is with respect to x.
But it is u.
So, we take the outside function.
Natural log of u.
The first derivative of that would be 1 over u.
And now we have to take the derivative of the inside function.
And that is u prime.
In other words, u prime over u.
U prime over u.
And this is called d.
Let me write it here.
Logarithmic derivative.
Something you should remember.
Let's get more space there.
So, it is worthwhile maybe to pause.
And just look at these.
The u and u prime again.
Where I got this u.
And where I get u prime.
U prime there.
And where I get u prime here.
And where I get u here.
So that you can see.
If I let u then equal.
The secant of x plus the tangent of xy.
I then get that the secant of x equals.
U prime over u.
Why we get u prime over u.
Now.
Let's just substitute back.
So.
Let's change back to orange.
If I now have.
That u prime over u.
Is going to be.
Well, we have it here.
U prime over u is going to be d dx.
D dx of the natural log of.
But u was.
Secant of x.
Plus tangent of x.
Now u prime over u.
We've just seen.
That is the secant of x.
So the secant of x equals.
Derivative with respect to x.
Of the natural log of the secant of x.
Of the secant of x.
Plus the tangent of x.
Now let's integrate both sides with respect to x.
So we're going to get.
Indefinite integral of the secant of x.
With respect to x.
Equals.
The indefinite integral of the derivative with respect to x.
Of the natural log of the secant of x.
Plus the tangent of x.
With respect to x.
Now on the left hand side.
Is the problem that we originally started with.
There.
We wanted to know the indefinite integral of the secant of x.
With respect to x.
So we have that on the left hand side.
The secant of x.
With respect to x.
Equals.
Now we're taking the integral of the derivative of a function.
They cancel out.
So we're just left with.
The natural log of the secant of x.
Plus the tangent of x.
Plus c.
And there we have the integral.
Of the secant of x.
Quite a bit more difficult than the tangent of x.
But.
Through lateral thinking.
And you can well imagine.
The.
Mathematicians who first.
And.
Struggled with this problem.
Newton.
Leibniz.
And the like.
Now they had to use a bit of lateral thinking.
To get to the answer.
To get to the×£ line.
What .
Technicism.
The non problem with lacks.
On the left hand side.
The third one.
The third to do.
So.
The third one.
The third one.
The third Why?
How about that N.
The third one.
And the third one.
On the left side.
So.
We can Jung.
The third one.
We can go.
How about that N.
