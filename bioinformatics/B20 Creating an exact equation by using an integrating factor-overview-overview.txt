The text describes a technique for solving non-exact differential equations by transforming them into exact ones using an integrating factor (\(\mu\)). An equation is deemed non-exact if \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial y} \neq \frac{\partial m}{\partial x}\). To make the equation exact, multiply it by an appropriate integrating factor.

The method involves two potential approaches for finding this integrating factor:

1. **Function of \(x\):** Assume \(\mu\) is a function of \(x\) alone. This simplifies the process since \(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial y}\) becomes zero, leading to:
   \[
   \frac{d\mu}{dx} = \left(\frac{\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x}{n}\right)
   \]
   Solve this by separating variables and integrating:
   \[
   \ln |\mu| = \int \left(\frac{\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x}{n}\right) dx
   \]
   Then, find \(\mu(x)\) by exponentiating.

2. **Function of \(y\):** Assume \(\mu\) is a function of \(y\) alone. This leads to:
   \[
   \frac{d\mu}{dy} = \left(\frac{\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y}{m}\right)
   \]
   Solve by separating variables and integrating:
   \[
   \ln |\mu| = \int \left(\frac{\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y}{m}\right) dy
   \]
   Then, find \(\mu(y)\) by exponentiating.

The choice between these methods depends on whether the expression \((\partial m/\partial y - \partial n/\partial x)/n\) is solely a function of \(x\) or if \((\partial n/\partial x - \partial m/\partial y)/m\) is only a function of \(y\). If neither condition is met, these methods may not be applicable. The text suggests trying both approaches to identify an integrating factor that makes the differential equation exact.
