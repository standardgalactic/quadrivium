The text outlines the process of performing a statistical analysis using a t-test. The objective is to compare the means of two sets of numerical data. To achieve this, a p-value will be calculated. A p-value helps determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the datasets. The mention of a t-test indicates that this method will be used to conduct the comparison.

The text describes a statistical process where two sets of numerical data will be compared using a t-test to evaluate if there are significant differences between their means. The outcome of the test will yield a p-value, which helps determine the likelihood that any observed difference is due to chance. This summary indicates a focus on understanding whether the two datasets differ significantly in terms of their average values.
