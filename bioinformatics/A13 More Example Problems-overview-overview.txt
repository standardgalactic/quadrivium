The text outlines the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a 3x3 matrix \( A \) through linear algebraic methods. It begins by constructing the matrix \( C = A - \lambda I \), where \( \lambda \) represents the eigenvalues, aiming to find values such that the determinant of \( C \) is zero. This leads to deriving the characteristic polynomial:

\[ -\lambda^3 + 5\lambda^2 - 8\lambda + 4 = 0. \]

Upon factoring this polynomial, two distinct eigenvalues are found: \( \lambda_1 = 1 \) and a repeated eigenvalue \( \lambda_2 = 2 \).

The text then explores finding eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues:

- For \( \lambda = 1 \), solving the system derived from \( A - I \) yields two distinct eigenvectors: \([1, 0]^T\) and \([0, 1]^T\).
  
- For the repeated eigenvalue \( \lambda = 2 \), the associated system leads to a single linearly independent eigenvector \([1, 1, 1]^T\).

The presence of a repeated eigenvalue necessitates examining the dimensionality of the eigenspace to ensure it is spanned correctly by enough linearly independent vectors.

Finally, these results are applied to formulating solutions for a differential equation involving exponential terms. The solution combines various terms with coefficients derived from the eigenvectors and is expressed as a sum involving exponentials like \( e^{2t} \).

The text emphasizes revisiting foundational mathematical techniques such as polynomial factorization and solving linear equations, highlighting that despite initial complexity, these methods can yield straightforward solutions even in scenarios involving repeated eigenvalues.
