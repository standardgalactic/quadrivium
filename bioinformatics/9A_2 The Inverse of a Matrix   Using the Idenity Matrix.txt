Okay, let us look at the method of using the extension of a squared matrix by adding an identity matrix to that, doing the elementary row operations on that, to get to the inverse.
And I'm going to take you through a very long process, but we need to prove and show how this works.
So let us construct a linear set all by ourselves. Let's have x1, x2 and x3 and b equals b. Let's have that. Let's construct our own one and I've done that here.
Let's make x1, 1. We're constructing our own x2, I made 3, 3, 3. So we're cheating. We already know what the answers are. I know what x1 is, I know what x2 is.
And I made x3, 4. And I made my answers b, negative 5, negative 5, 4 and 6. And the way I got to those was I made this 1 plus 2 minus 3.
And I made this 2 plus 2 minus 1. And I made this 1 minus 1 plus 2. So indeed you'll see that 1 minus 3 is negative 2. Negative 2 plus 8 equals 6.
So in actual fact I have my 3 equations as x1 plus 2 times x2 minus 3 times x3 equals negative 5. I have 2 times x1 plus 2 times x2 minus x3 equals 4.
And I have x1 minus... Good apologies there, the card was full and I had to change cards. I don't know exactly where it stopped recording.
So I created my own linear set. And I added these constants to my 3 unknowns. I know exactly x1 is 1, x2 is 3, x3 is 4.
And I'm going to go through this whole process and get to those answers, those values for my variables x1, x2, x3.
Okay, and I've rewritten this in a form of 3 equations and 3 unknowns. Now I am constructing my matrix of constants, yeah?
1, 2, negative 3. Now 2, 2, negative 1. 2, 2, negative 1. And I have 1, negative 1, 2.
1, negative 1, and 2. So this I will call my matrix A. Now I'm going to have my problem vector of unknowns, x1, x2, x3.
And that will call x. And that will call x. And that equals b. And my b is minus 5, minus 5, 4, and 6.
Okay. So A x equals b. I am going to get the inverse of A. So I'm going to have A inverse times this A x.
And I'm going to have it equal A inverse b. So this will disappear. So x will be A inverse b.
So if I can get the inverse of this matrix multiplied by this matrix, I'm going to get a column vector x with my answers for x1, x2, x3.
Okay. So in the next video, we're going to do that. We're going to get the inverse of this.
And just note, just before we leave, this is a 3 by 3 matrix, 3 rows and 3 columns.
This is 3 rows and 1 column. So this column, these columns equals these rows.
So my answer is going to be a 3 by 1 and indeed 3 rows, 1 column. So nothing wrong with it.
Okay. So let's get the inverse of that in the next video.
Okay. I'm here again with my matrix A, 1, 2, negative 3, 2, 2, negative 1, 1, negative 1, 2.
To this, I extend my matrix with an identity matrix.
Okay. So I'm going to have 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.
Now, I've got to get this into an identity matrix and whatever's left there, we'll see.
So first of all, I need leading 1s. This is not a leading 1. I need to get rid of this 2. How can I do that?
Well, if I multiply this row out by negative 2, multiply by negative 2, what do I get?
I get negative 2, negative 4, 6, negative 2, 0, 0.
Let us add that to the second row.
So I'm left with 1, 2, negative 3, 1, 0, 0.
Nothing wrong there.
Now, let's do this.
2 plus negative 2 is 0.
That's why I wanted the negative 2 there, so I can get rid of my leading 1, my leading value there.
Okay.
So when there's 2 and negative 4, that's negative 2.
Negative 1 and 6 is 5.
0 and negative 2 is negative 2.
1 and 0 is 1.
0 and 0 is 0.
Now, what I'm going to do, I'm going to check out the bar tab because I've done it before
and I don't want to make a silly mistake and redo this whole video.
0, negative 2, 5, negative 2, 1, 0.
How can I get rid of this leading 1?
Well, I can just subtract this from the first one.
1 minus 1 is 0.
2 minus minus 1 is 3.
3, negative 3 minus 2 is negative 5.
1 times 0 is 1.
0 times 0 is 0.
0 minus 1 is negative 1.
Okay.
So there's my first plot.
I've gotten rid of my leading 0, 0.
So now I still need to turn that into a 0, that into a 0, that into a 1, that into a 0, that into a 0, that into a 0, that into a 1.
Okay.
Let's go.
Am I going to try 3, negative 5, 1, 0, negative 1.
Okay.
Now the next thing is I need to turn this into a 1.
Remember, we're going for the 1s first.
We're not now going to try and change this to a, that's not how row operations work.
Remember, we're going to work from top to bottom all the time until we get 0, 0, 1 here, then we reverse.
Okay.
So the first thing now still is to make this into, to make that into a, into a 1.
And the way I can do that, I don't have to do any multiplying one row or something and then adding and subtracting.
What I can just do is write 1, 2, negative 3, 1, 0, 0.
I can multiply out by negative 1 half.
If I multiply this whole row out by negative 1 half, I have 0.
Negative 1 half times 2.
Negative 1 half times 2 is, is 1.
Negative 1 half will give me negative 5 over 2.
Negative 1 half gives me 1.
Where am I?
Where am I?
Let me just make sure I'm making a mistake.
I'm left with 0, 1, negative 5 over 2, 1.
Okay.
1 times negative 1 half is negative 1 half.
And negative 1 half times 0 is 0.
So I'm left with 0, 1, negative 5 over 2, 1, negative 1 over 2, 0.
And this I can multiply, this row I can multiply out by a third.
So here I'm going to be left with 1.
A third times 3 is 1.
Times a third is negative 5 over 3.
Times a third is a third.
Times a third is 0.
Times a third is negative.
Okay.
So now I am, I've got all my leading 1's.
That was my first step.
And now I also not, should not have leading 1's underneath, a leading 1 on top of it.
But I can get away, I can get rid of this one by just subtracting this row from that row.
So let's go.
So I'm not doing anything to the first row.
1, 2, negative 3, 1, 0, 0.
I'm left with 0, 1, negative 5 over 2, 1, negative 1 over 2, 0.
Now again, 0 minus 0, 0, 1 minus 1, 0.
Negative 5 over 2, minus negative 5 over 3, I get to be, where is it, negative 5 over 6.
I'm just going to copy it there.
Negative 5 over 6, 2 over 3, negative 1 over 2, and a third.
Let's just see if that's right.
Negative 5 over 6, 2 over 3, negative 1 over 2, a third.
Okay.
So just check on that.
Make sure, well, I'm sure I didn't make a mistake.
So I've just subtracted this one from that row.
0 minus negative 1 third is a third.
A half minus 0, negative 1 half minus 0 is still negative 1 half.
So I'm left there.
All I need to do now is just to get this one into a leading 1.
Because I want leading 1's all the way down, but at a diagonal, underneath any leading 1's
should be 0's.
So once again, it's 1, 2, negative 3, 1, 0, 0.
0, 1, negative 5 over 2.
1, negative 1 over 2, 0.
So I'm going to multiply this out by negative 6 over 5.
Because negative 5 over 6 times negative 6 over 5 equals 1.
So that'll be a 0, that'll be a 0, that'll be a 1.
2 over 3 times negative 6 over 5 is going to leave me with negative 4 over 5.
Negative 1 over 2 times negative 6 over 5 leaves me with 3 over 5.
And a third times negative 6 over 5 leaves me with a negative 2 over 5, if I've got that
correctly.
See, 0, 0, 1, negative 4 over 5, 3 over 5, negative 2 over 5.
Okay.
Now that I've got this leading 1's, I need to move back.
Okay, now I start moving in reverse.
So now on top of this 1, I need a 0.
On top of that 1, I need a 0.
And what can I do?
For instance, I think what I had done with that one is,
I multiplied this row up by 5 over 2.
Let's do that.
So that's 0, that's 0, that's 5 over 2, 5 over 2, negative 4 over 5 times 5 over 2 is
going to be a negative, what is that, is that right, let me just see, let me see, 0, this
row, I'm multiplying out this row.
Let's just see, let's just see.
5 over 2, yeah, that's negative 2, sorry, I lost myself there.
So I'm multiplying out by 5, by a positive 5 over 2, positive 5 over 2, times positive
5 over 2, 5's cancel, there'll be a negative 2, 5 over, 5 over 2 will be 3 over, where am
I, multiply by 5 over 2, it's going to be 3 over 2, and multiply by 5 over 2, so it's going
to be a negative 1, okay, so let's go to the first row, 1, 2, negative 3, 1, 0, 0, now
I'm going to add, I've multiplied out this row by 5 over 2, and I'm going to add the resultant
to this one, so 0 plus 0 is 0, 1 plus 0 is 1, negative 5 over 2, negative 5 over 2 plus
5 over 2 is 0, 1 plus negative 2 is negative 1, minus a half, plus 3 over 2 is 2 over 2,
which is just 1, and let me just see, yeah, this is 1, and 0, negative 1 is negative 1,
so I'm left with 0, 1, 0, negative 1, 1, negative 1, that's quite correct, and here I still
have 0, 0, 1, negative 4 over 5, 3 over 5, negative 2 over 5, okay, I'm going to stop
the video then, we're going to go up, and we'll do the last two.
