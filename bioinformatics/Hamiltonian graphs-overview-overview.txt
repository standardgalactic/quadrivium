The text introduces Hamilton walks in graph theory, contrasting them with Eulerian walks by focusing on visiting each node exactly once without revisiting any. Named after William Rowan Hamilton, who devised this concept around the 1850s as a puzzle to generate drinking money, it involves finding a path that visits all nodes (or cities) exactly once.

Two types of Hamilton walks are discussed: open and closed. An open walk starts at one node and ends at another without revisiting any nodes, while a closed walk returns to the starting point after visiting all nodes.

Examples with graphs illustrate possible open and closed Hamiltonian paths. Some graph configurations allow multiple closed Hamiltonian cycles, suitable for solving Hamilton's puzzle game. The text concludes by showing how computational tools like Mathematica can identify Hamiltonian cycles in complex structures such as dodecahedron graphs, highlighting the utility of these tools in exploring mathematical concepts.
