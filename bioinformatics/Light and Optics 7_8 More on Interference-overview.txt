The text describes solving problems related to Young's double slit experiment, focusing on calculating distances between interference fringes and understanding how different parameters affect fringe patterns.

1. **Problem 1: Calculating Distance to the Third Bright Fringe**
   - The setup involves slits separated by 0.12 mm with red light of wavelength 664 nm.
   - The distance from the slits to the screen is 2.75 meters.
   - To find the distance (D) from the central bright fringe to the third bright fringe, use trigonometry and interference conditions:
     \[
     \theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{M \lambda}{d}\right)
     \]
     For \( M = 3 \), calculate the angle \(\theta\) and then find \( D \) using:
     \[
     D = L \cdot \tan(\theta)
     \]
   - The result is approximately 571 nm.

2. **Fringe Separation**
   - Smaller slit separation (\(d\)) or larger wavelength (\(\lambda\)) increases the angle (\(\theta\)), thus increasing fringe separation.
   - Conversely, larger \(d\) or smaller \(\lambda\) reduces fringe separation.

3. **Phase Shift and Interference**
   - Shifting both waves by half a wavelength results in swapping bright and dark bands due to phase shift causing destructive interference where constructive was expected, and vice versa.

4. **Example Calculation for Eighth Bright Fringe**
   - Given the path difference (\(\Delta L\)) of 4.57 micrometers for the eighth fringe:
     \[
     \Delta L = M \lambda
     \]
   - For \(M = 8\), solve for \(\lambda\):
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{\Delta L}{M} = \frac{4.57 \times 10^{-6}}{8} \approx 571 \text{ nm}
     \]

The text emphasizes understanding the relationships between slit separation, wavelength, path difference, and fringe patterns in double slit experiments.

The text describes an explanation and problem-solving process for a Young's double slit experiment setup. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Setup Details**:
   - The distance between the slits (D) is 0.12 millimeters.
   - The light used has a wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of 664 nanometers.
   - The distance from the slits to the screen where interference patterns are observed (L) is 2.75 meters.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the distance from the central bright fringe to the third bright fringe.

3. **Methodology**:
   - Use the formula for the angle \(\theta\) of the m-th order maximum: 
     \[
     \sin \theta = \frac{m\lambda}{D}
     \]
     For \(m = 3\).
   - Calculate \(\theta\) using \(\tan \theta = \frac{y}{L}\), where \(y\) is the distance to the third bright fringe.
   - Solve for \(y\) using:
     \[
     y = L \cdot \tan \theta
     \]
   - The calculated distance \(y\) turns out to be approximately 0.091 meters.

4. **Additional Concepts**:
   - As the order of fringes increases, the brightness decreases.
   - Smaller angles between slits and screen result in smaller separations between light and dark bands.
   - Shifting both waves by half a wavelength results in swapping bright and dark bands due to phase change.

5. **Problem Solving**:
   - For another setup where the difference in path lengths (\(\Delta L\)) at the eighth fringe is 4.57 micrometers, calculate the wavelength.
   - Use \(\Delta L = m\lambda\) for \(m = 8\) to find \(\lambda = 571\) nanometers.

The explanation integrates theoretical concepts with practical calculations to understand and predict outcomes in a double slit experiment.
