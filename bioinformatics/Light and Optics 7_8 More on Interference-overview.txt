The text describes solving problems related to Young's double slit experiment, focusing on calculating distances between interference fringes and understanding how different parameters affect fringe patterns.

1. **Problem 1: Calculating Distance to the Third Bright Fringe**
   - The setup involves slits separated by 0.12 mm with red light of wavelength 664 nm.
   - The distance from the slits to the screen is 2.75 meters.
   - To find the distance (D) from the central bright fringe to the third bright fringe, use trigonometry and interference conditions:
     \[
     \theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{M \lambda}{d}\right)
     \]
     For \( M = 3 \), calculate the angle \(\theta\) and then find \( D \) using:
     \[
     D = L \cdot \tan(\theta)
     \]
   - The result is approximately 571 nm.

2. **Fringe Separation**
   - Smaller slit separation (\(d\)) or larger wavelength (\(\lambda\)) increases the angle (\(\theta\)), thus increasing fringe separation.
   - Conversely, larger \(d\) or smaller \(\lambda\) reduces fringe separation.

3. **Phase Shift and Interference**
   - Shifting both waves by half a wavelength results in swapping bright and dark bands due to phase shift causing destructive interference where constructive was expected, and vice versa.

4. **Example Calculation for Eighth Bright Fringe**
   - Given the path difference (\(\Delta L\)) of 4.57 micrometers for the eighth fringe:
     \[
     \Delta L = M \lambda
     \]
   - For \(M = 8\), solve for \(\lambda\):
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{\Delta L}{M} = \frac{4.57 \times 10^{-6}}{8} \approx 571 \text{ nm}
     \]

The text emphasizes understanding the relationships between slit separation, wavelength, path difference, and fringe patterns in double slit experiments.
