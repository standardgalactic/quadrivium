The text describes finding the indefinite integral of \(\cos(2x + 4)\) with respect to \(x\) using substitution. By letting \(u = 2x + 4\), we derive that \(du/dx = 2\), leading to \(dx = \frac{1}{2} du\). Substituting these into the integral, it becomes:

\[
\int \cos(2x + 4) \, dx = \int \cos(u) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, du
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int \cos(u) \, du
\]

The integral of \(\cos(u)\) is \(\sin(u)\), resulting in:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin(u) + C
\]

Substituting back for \(u\), the final result is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin(2x + 4) + C
\]

This substitution method provides an efficient way to find the indefinite integral without needing additional functions.
