The text outlines guidelines for nutritional support in patients undergoing surgery, focusing on three main stages: 

1. **Pre-Optimization:** This stage involves beginning nutritional supplements 10 days to two weeks before surgery, especially for malnourished patients or those facing major surgeries like colectomy. The objective is to enhance the patient's nutrition prior to surgery.

2. **Intraoperative and Postoperative Supplementation:** After surgery begins or concludes, more invasive methods such as enteral (tube feeding) or parenteral (intravenous) nutrition may be employed if the advantages outweigh potential risks like infections or organ perforation. Enteral feeding is generally preferred due to its physiological benefits unless it fails to meet caloric requirements.

3. **Choosing and Managing Nutritional Support:**
   - **Indications for Tube Feeding:** It's recommended for patients unable to consume over 60% of their daily calories orally, such as those with major burns, swallowing difficulties from head injuries or strokes, or specific gastrointestinal issues.
   - **Deciding on the Type of Feed and Timing:** Nasogastric or nasojejunal tubes are suitable for short-term needs (less than six weeks), while long-term requirements may necessitate more permanent solutions like stomas in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract.
   - **Managing Complications:** Potential complications from tube feeding include mechanical issues (like pressure necrosis and strictures) and metabolic problems (such as refeeding syndrome). Monitoring and managing these carefully is essential.

The text emphasizes starting early, with small volumes, and increasing gradually based on patient tolerance. The nutritional approach should be customized to the individual's specific needs and medical conditions.
