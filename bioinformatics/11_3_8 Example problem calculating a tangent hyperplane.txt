Let's have a look. Let's bring up our knowledge together. In this example, we have the f of x, y, and z equals x squared plus y squared plus z squared.
And we want an equation for a tangent plane today. So that will be a hyperplane. This is in four dimensions, not something that you can visualize in your head with any kind of ease.
So the point we have there is expressed there as a vector p, and it is 1 comma 1 comma negative 1. First of all, can we remember the equation that we need?
Now, we write that t of that vector x, that is the equation for our plane. The reason why we write t there is later on we will see we are going to use this very same equation for local linearization.
If I can use that term here, of an equation. But remember that that equals the f of p of that vector p plus vector x minus vector p, and the dot product, that would be gradient of our function at point p or vector p.
And we don't, we don't, we don't, we, we, not only do we require that, but we also have to show that we limit, limit as vector x approaches vector p of the f of x minus this t of x of ours
divided by the norm of the norm. The difference between these two vectors should equal 0. Okay, we also need to show that.
Now, let's have a look. What do we need? First of all, we need the f of this vector p, f of 1 comma 1 comma negative 1.
So this is going to be 1 plus 1 plus that will also be 1 that's going to equal 3
Let's look at what x minus p is. Remember x, our vector x is x, y, and z
And from that we subtract our point, 1 by 1 called negative 1
And then this is going to leave us x minus 1, y minus 1, and z plus 1
That will be that part
Now let's get the gradient, the gradient of f first at x, y, and z
That is going to equal, we are just going to differentiate
Take partial derivatives with respect to x, so y and z are constants
So that will leave us with 2x
If we do x and z as constants, that will leave us with 2y
And very easily we will also be left with 2z
Now let's get the gradient at that specific point
Which means we are just going to replace x, y, and z with 1, 1, negative 1
So the gradient of f of point p
Is going to equal 2, 2, negative 2
2, 2, negative 2
So there is our value there
So let's have a look at this
This is going to equal the f of p with 3
Plus, now we need to get the dot product between these two vectors
The dot product between these two vectors
So it's going to be x minus 1 times 2
So this is 2x minus 2
2x minus 2
Plus
2y minus 2
2y minus 2
Now we have a negative 2
Now we have a negative 2
So it's going to be minus 2
So it's negative 2 times that
So it's the dot product
So that's minus 2
Do I have that?
Minus 2
Minus 2z
Is the correct value
Minus 2z minus 2
Minus 2
So this is going to equal
2x plus 2y plus 2y minus 2z
And I have negative 2
Negative 2
Negative 2
Negative 2
That's negative 6
Plus 3 is going to be negative 3
So that is the equation t of x
Remember I say t of x
But I don't mean x itself
It's x, y, and z
That vector x
Okay
But now we need to show
That it is actually
It actually is tangent
At that point
So we need to show this
We need to show this
So what do we have here?
So that equals the limit
As x, y, and z
Approaches
1 comma 1 comma negative 1
Of f of x
What's that?
x squared plus y squared
Plus z squared
Minus this
Now note that
Note very carefully
That we can rewrite
We can rewrite this
If I take
That subtracted from this
Let's have
Let's group things together
So there will be an x squared
That will become
Negative 2x
Because I'm subtracting this
And this negative 3
Let's divide that up
Into negative 1
Negative 1
Negative 1
So I'll have
1 negative 1
Plus y squared
Minus 2y
So you see
I'm just grouping these
Minus 2y
And I've got
And I've got another
1 negative 1
And lastly
We'll have
Plus a z squared
But now we have
Minus
2z
Times this negative
Is positive 2z
And we have
And we have a
Plus 3 left
Where am I now?
Where am I now?
Am I doing the right thing?
No I'm not
Remember this was
If this minus is distributed
In here
This becomes a positive 3
So that's
Plus 1
Plus 1
Plus 1
Sorry about that
And we're going to
And we're going to
Divide it by
The norm of this
The norm of
Where were we?
X minus p
There we go
So the norm of that
That is going to be
The square root of
And x minus 1
X minus 1 squared
Plus y minus 1 squared
Plus
It was a z
Plus 1 squared
And z plus 1
Squared
All to the power of a half
And you'll know
Very easily
That you can
You can
Revert this back
To x minus 1 squared
X minus 1 squared
Is exactly that
Y minus 1 squared
Is exactly this
And z plus 1 squared
Is exactly that
So all of this
Is to the power
Let's say
2 over 2
And this is
To exactly the same
To the denominator
To the power of a half
So we're just going to
End up
With all of this
To the power of a half
Let me write that out
Limit as
X, Y, and Z
The trache is
1, 1, negative 1
Of
Exactly this
So that's going to be
X minus 1 squared
Plus
Y minus 1 squared
Plus
Z plus 1
Squared
And all of that
To the power of a half
Of the square root of that
Now
If I substitute
All of this in
1 minus 1
Is 0
1 minus 1
Is 0
Negative 1
Plus 1
Is 0
So that's the square root
Of 0
Let it be
Whole
That is equal to 0
The limit
Equals to 0
So that's correct
So I can now say
That this is
The equation
For
The tangent
Hyperplane
To this function
In 4 dimensional space
At this
At this
Very point
To this
Every minute
