The text outlines the method of integrating polynomial fractions using partial fraction decomposition, exemplified by the integral of \((x^2 + 2) / ((x - 1)^2 (x + 2))\). The procedure requires that:

1. The degree of the numerator is less than that of the denominator.
2. Each factor in the denominator has its variable raised to a power of 1 after factoring.

The integration process involves decomposing the expression into simpler fractions:
- \(\frac{a}{x - 1}\)
- \(\frac{b}{(x - 1)^2}\)
- \(\frac{c}{x + 2}\)

To solve for \(c\), substituting \(x = -2\) simplifies the equation by eliminating terms involving \(x + 2\), allowing \(c\) to be found easily as \(\frac{6}{9}\).

Next, solving for \(b\) involves multiplying both sides by \((x - 1)^2\) to isolate it. Setting \(x = 1\) zeros out terms with \((x-1)\), yielding \(b = 1\).

The text then simplifies the expression further and solves for \(a\) by substituting \(x = 0\), resulting in \(a = \frac{1}{3}\). 

The final decomposed form of the integral is:
\[
\frac{1}{3(x-1)} + \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{6}{9(x+2)}
\]

This decomposition allows for straightforward integration, completing the solution.
