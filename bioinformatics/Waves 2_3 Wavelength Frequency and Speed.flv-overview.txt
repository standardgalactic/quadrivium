The text provides an explanation of how to calculate the velocity and transverse velocity for different wave functions. Here's a summary:

1. **Wave Velocity (v):** 
   - The velocity \( v \) is calculated as the product of frequency (\( f \)) and wavelength (\( \lambda \)).
   - For wave functions described by \( y = y_{\text{max}} \sin(kx - \omega t) \), \( \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k} \) and \( f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \).
   - The velocity is computed for three different wave scenarios:
     - First case: \( v = 0.5 \)
     - Second case: \( v = \frac{4}{3} \)
     - Third case: \( v = 1 \)

2. **Transverse Velocity:** 
   - The transverse velocity is the first derivative of displacement with respect to time, keeping \( x \) constant.
   - For each wave function:
     - First function: Transverse velocity is \( -4\cos(4x - 2t) \)
     - Second function: Transverse velocity is not explicitly calculated here.
     - Third function: Transverse velocity is \( -6\cos(3x - 3t) \)

3. **Problem Solving Approach:** 
   - A specific problem involves a wave with amplitude 6 mm and angular frequency of 600 radians per second.
   - The challenge is to determine the time taken for displacement from +2 mm to -2 mm without knowing \( k \).
   - By considering uniform circular motion, we relate the amplitude as radius (6 mm) and use angular speed to find circumferences traveled per second: \( \frac{300}{\pi} \).
   - The circumference of this wave is \( 12\pi \) mm.
   - This approach helps estimate time taken for specific displacement changes.

The text discusses how to relate phase angles in waves to distances and times using concepts from circular motion and wave mechanics.

1. **Uniform Circular Motion and Wave Displacement**:
   - The speaker equates a sine wave's displacement to uniform circular motion, given a circle with radius 6 mm.
   - This circle has a circumference of \(12\pi\) mm (since \(C = 2\pi r\) and \(r = 6\) mm).
   - At a speed of 3600 mm/s, the time taken for the wave to travel from +2 mm to -2 mm displacement is calculated as 1.1 milliseconds.

2. **Phase Angle Concept**:
   - A phase angle represents the difference in position between two points on a wave.
   - The text provides an example: Given a wave velocity of 350 m/s and frequency of 500 Hz, the wavelength is \( \frac{350}{500} = 0.7\) meters.
   - One wavelength (0.7 meters) corresponds to \(2\pi\) radians.

3. **Converting Phase Angles to Distances**:
   - For a phase angle difference of \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), the corresponding distance is calculated as \(\frac{1}{6} \times 0.7 = \frac{7}{60}\) meters.
   - This conversion uses the relationship between wavelength and radians.

4. **Converting Time to Phase Angles**:
   - To find the phase angle difference for a time interval of one millisecond, use the wave velocity: \(0.001 \times 350 = 0.35\) meters.
   - Convert this distance back to radians using the known conversion factor (since \(0.7\) meters equals \(2\pi\) radians).

The text emphasizes understanding how phase angles can be translated into physical distances or time intervals on a wave, using basic principles of circular motion and trigonometric functions like sine and cosine.

The text describes a process of converting between different units related to waves and circular motion. It explains how 0.7 meters corresponds to 2π radians and simplifies calculations by remembering key relationships, such as 2π radians equaling one wavelength. The discussion further details that 0.35 meters is equivalent to π radians, indicating a phase difference of π radians for a time difference of one millisecond. The text highlights using basic principles from classical mechanics—specifically the relationship between velocity, distance, and time—to interchangeably convert between measurements like distance, time, wavelength, and radians. This underscores fundamental physics concepts that are often among the first learned in introductory courses.
