The video explains how calculating anti-derivatives is crucial for understanding integration. Integration is described as the reverse process of differentiation. Using \( y = x^2 \) as an example, it shows that differentiating gives \( \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x \). To find the anti-derivative, you increase the power by one and divide the coefficient by this new power, resulting in \( y = x^2 + c \), where \( c \) is a constant. The notation for integration involves the integral symbol (\(\int\)) and represents the indefinite integral with respect to a variable. It includes an arbitrary constant \( c \) because differentiating a constant yields zero, indicating that any constant could have been part of the original function. Thus, integration allows recovering the family of functions from the derivative by adding this arbitrary constant \( c \).
