The text outlines strategies for managing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in patients undergoing surgery due to their increased risk of post-operative complications such as apnea, desaturation, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Key management steps include:

1. **Preoperative Assessments**: Utilizing spirometry or incentive spirometry to enhance lung function, encouraging exercise and weight loss despite time constraints, using CPAP devices, and considering mandibular advancement devices.

2. **Identifying At-Risk Patients**: Employing the Berlin questionnaire and overnight sleep tests (when available) to identify patients with OSAS.

3. **Preoperative Interventions**: Encouraging preoperative incentive spirometry, improving nutritional status, and advising smoking cessation six to eight weeks before surgery to lower complication risks.

4. **Utilizing Predictive Tools**: Employing risk calculators, like those by Gupta et al., which assess the likelihood of post-operative pneumonia and respiratory failure based on various patient factors, aiding in identifying high-risk patients for tailored management.

Overall, comprehensive preoperative assessment, strategic interventions, and the use of predictive tools are essential for optimizing surgical outcomes in OSAS patients.
