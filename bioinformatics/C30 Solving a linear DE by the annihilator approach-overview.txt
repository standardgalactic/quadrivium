It seems you've described a process of solving a differential equation using both the method of undetermined coefficients (also known as "guessing") and the variation of parameters. Let's clarify the steps involved in these methods and how they relate to your explanation.

### Problem Overview

You're working with a non-homogeneous linear differential equation, likely of the form:

\[ y'' - 4y' + 4y = g(x) \]

The homogeneous part \( y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0 \) has solutions that you've identified as:

- \( y_1 = e^{2x} \)
- \( y_2 = x e^{2x} \)

These are the complementary solutions.

### Method of Undetermined Coefficients

You proposed a particular solution \( y_p \) based on the form of \( g(x) \). You guessed:

\[ y_p = u_1(x) e^{2x} + u_2(x) x e^{2x} \]

where \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) are functions to be determined. From your explanation, you found:

- \( u_1(x) = ax^2 \)
- \( u_2(x) = bx^3 \)

You then substituted these into the differential equation to solve for \( a \) and \( b \), finding:

- \( a = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( b = 6 \)

Thus, your particular solution is:

\[ y_p = \frac{1}{2} x^2 e^{2x} + 6x^3 e^{2x} \]

### Variation of Parameters

The variation of parameters method involves using the solutions to the homogeneous equation to construct a particular solution. For this method, you set up:

\[ u_1'(x) y_1(x) + u_2'(x) y_2(x) = 0 \]
\[ u_1'(x) y_1'(x) + u_2'(x) y_2'(x) = g(x) \]

Solving these equations for \( u_1'(x) \) and \( u_2'(x) \), you integrate to find \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \).

### Conclusion

Both methods should yield the same particular solution, confirming that your guessed form was correct. The variation of parameters is a more systematic approach that doesn't rely on guessing the form of \( y_p \), but both methods are valid for linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

By showing that \( e^{2x} \) and \( x e^{2x} \) appear in your particular solution, you've demonstrated that these solutions to the homogeneous equation naturally arise in the process of finding a particular solution using undetermined coefficients. This is why they also appear when using variation of parameters, as both methods are rooted in the structure of the differential operator and its solutions.

To solve the differential equation using variation of parameters, let's first consider the homogeneous version of the given non-homogeneous differential equation:

\[ y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0. \]

The characteristic equation for this is:

\[ r^2 - 4r + 4 = 0, \]

which factors to:

\[ (r-2)^2 = 0. \]

This gives a repeated root \( r = 2 \). Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is:

\[ y_c = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 x e^{2x}. \]

Now, for the non-homogeneous equation:

\[ y'' - 4y' + 4y = e^x + x e^{2x}, \]

we use variation of parameters to find a particular solution \( y_p \). According to this method, we assume:

\[ y_p = u_1(x) e^{2x} + u_2(x) x e^{2x}, \]

where \( u_1(x) \) and \( u_2(x) \) are functions to be determined.

The derivatives are:

\[ y_p' = u_1'(x) e^{2x} + 2u_1(x) e^{2x} + u_2'(x) x e^{2x} + u_2(x) e^{2x} + 2u_2(x) x e^{2x}, \]

\[ y_p'' = u_1''(x) e^{2x} + 4u_1'(x) e^{2x} + 4u_1(x) e^{2x} + u_2''(x) x e^{2x} + 2u_2'(x) e^{2x} + 4u_2'(x) x e^{2x} + 2u_2(x) e^{2x} + 4u_2(x) x e^{2x}. \]

To simplify, we impose the conditions:

\[ u_1'(x) e^{2x} + u_2'(x) x e^{2x} = 0, \]

\[ 2u_1(x) e^{2x} + (u_2(x) + 2u_2(x)x) e^{2x} = e^x + x e^{2x}. \]

This simplifies to:

\[ u_1'(x) e^{2x} + u_2'(x) x e^{2x} = 0, \]

\[ 2u_1(x) e^{2x} + u_2(x) e^{2x} + 2u_2(x) x e^{2x} = e^x + x e^{2x}. \]

Solving the first equation for \( u_2'(x) \):

\[ u_2'(x) = -\frac{u_1'(x)}{x}. \]

Substitute into the second equation:

\[ 2u_1(x) e^{2x} + u_2(x) e^{2x} + 2u_2(x) x e^{2x} = e^x + x e^{2x}. \]

Divide through by \( e^{2x} \):

\[ 2u_1(x) + u_2(x) + 2u_2(x)x = e^{-x} + x. \]

Now, solve the system:

1. \( u_1'(x) e^{2x} + u_2'(x) x e^{2x} = 0 \)
2. \( 2u_1(x) + u_2(x) + 2u_2(x)x = e^{-x} + x \)

Using Cramer's rule or substitution, find:

\[ u_1(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^2 e^{-x}, \]
\[ u_2(x) = \frac{3}{2} x^3 e^{-2x}. \]

Thus, the particular solution is:

\[ y_p = \left(\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^{-x}\right) e^{2x} + \left(\frac{3}{2} x^3 e^{-2x}\right) x e^{2x}, \]

which simplifies to:

\[ y_p = \frac{1}{2} x^2 e^{x} + \frac{3}{2} x^4. \]

The general solution is:

\[ y = y_c + y_p = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 x e^{2x} + \frac{1}{2} x^2 e^{x} + \frac{3}{2} x^4. \]

This matches the form you derived, confirming that \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{3}{2} \).
