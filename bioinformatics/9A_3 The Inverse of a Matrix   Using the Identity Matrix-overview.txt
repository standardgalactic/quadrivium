The text describes a step-by-step process for finding the inverse of a 3x3 matrix \(A\) using elementary row operations. The goal is to transform the left side of an augmented matrix into the identity matrix and thus derive the inverse on the right side.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the key steps:

1. **Setup**: Begin with an augmented matrix where the left part is matrix \(A\) and the right part is the identity matrix.
   
2. **Row Operations**: Perform row operations to create zeros above certain elements in the matrix:
   - Start by making zeros above the first element using appropriate multiplication and addition of rows.

3. **Progressively Eliminate Elements**:
   - Continue eliminating specific elements (like 2, -3, etc.) to transform \(A\) into an identity matrix.
   - Use combinations of row operations for efficiency, such as multiplying a row by a scalar and adding it to another row to zero out specific entries.

4. **Identity Matrix Formation**: Once the left side is transformed into the identity matrix, the right side becomes the inverse of \(A\).

5. **Verification**:
   - Verify the correctness of the inverse by recalculating a few steps.
   - Multiply the obtained inverse matrix \(A^{-1}\) with another matrix \(B\) to solve for vector \(x\), confirming that \(A^{-1} \times B = x\).
   - Check each element calculation against expected results to ensure accuracy.

6. **Conclusion**: The process demonstrates how solving a system of linear equations can be achieved by finding the inverse of a matrix and using it to compute solutions efficiently.

This method illustrates the power of matrix algebra in solving systems of linear equations through the use of inverses and row operations.
