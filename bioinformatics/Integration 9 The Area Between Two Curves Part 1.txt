Not only can we determine the area under a curve, but we can also determine the area between two curves.
View the two functions f and g on this graph.
We've used midpoint sums.
Note how the height of our rectangle at some point x equals ck is the f minus the g .
The width is still delta x.
The area of the rectangle will be height times width, and that is the f minus the g times delta x.
Summing the areas of all the rectangles leaves us with this sigma notation.
And if we take the limit as n nears infinity, we have an equation for the exact area between two curves on an interval.
