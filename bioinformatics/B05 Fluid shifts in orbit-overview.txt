When an astronaut returns from space and re-enters Earth’s gravity, several physiological changes occur:

1. **Preload Decrease**: Gravity pulls blood into the lower body, reducing preload (initial stretching of heart muscle fibers) and stroke volume, which drops to about 70 milliliters per beat or less.

2. **Heart Rate Increase**: To maintain adequate cardiac output despite reduced stroke volume, heart rate increases.

3. **Blood Pressure Drop and Orthostatic Hypotension**: Blood pressure decreases upon standing due to the redistribution of blood by gravity, leading to orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing up).

4. **Hormonal Changes**:
   - **ADH Increase**: Antidiuretic hormone levels rise threefold to conserve water and maintain plasma volume.
   - **Renin and Aldosterone Levels Rise**: Renin activity increases fourfold, leading to a 50% increase in aldosterone, which helps retain sodium and water.
   - **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Decrease**: This peptide decreases by about a third, reducing its role in promoting fluid excretion.

5. **Fluid Intake and Urinary Output**:
   - Fluid intake increases as expected due to the body's need for hydration.
   - Urinary output decreases compared to pre-flight levels (1G conditions) but is still higher than during the low-output phase of spaceflight.

These adjustments help the body adapt back to Earth’s gravity after experiencing microgravity in space.
