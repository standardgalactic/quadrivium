The text provides an overview of traumatic brain injury (TBI), focusing on its classification, management, and prevention strategies to improve patient outcomes. TBIs are classified based on severity using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):

1. **Mild TBI**: GCS 13-15, often resulting in concussions with a generally excellent prognosis but possible short-term cognitive issues.
2. **Moderate TBI**: GCS 9-12, characterized by stupor or lethargy and various neurological deficits upon recovery.
3. **Severe TBI**: GCS 3-8, associated with high mortality rates and poor functional outcomes.

Management follows Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles, prioritizing initial resuscitation to ensure accurate GCS assessment. The text distinguishes between primary brain injury (immediate damage from trauma) and secondary brain injury (subsequent damage), which significantly impacts patient outcomes and is a leading cause of in-hospital mortality post-TBI.

Secondary brain injuries can result from hypoxia, hypertension, and increased intracranial pressure due to brain swelling. Prevention involves maintaining arterial systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg and cerebral perfusion pressure over 60 mmHg. Brain swelling mechanisms such as hyperemia, vasogenic edema, and cytotoxic edema can worsen secondary injury by reducing cerebral perfusion.

The text underscores the importance of interrupting the cycle of secondary brain injury to protect brain tissue not directly affected by primary trauma.
