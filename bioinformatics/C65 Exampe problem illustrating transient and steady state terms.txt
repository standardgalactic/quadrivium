Let's have a look then at this problem where we're going to have a transient and
a steady-state solution because our uppercase f of t on the right hand side
is a periodic function. Because that is so we're going to have the two parts to
our solution. Here we have initial value problem as well. x of 0 is 0 and x prime
of 0 equals some constant. We call it x sub 1 is some constant. First of all we
need the we need the transient solution. In other words we can rewrite this in
differential form and set it equal to 0. 2d plus 2 of x and we're going to set that
equal to 0 which means we use our auxiliary equation and for that we're
going to say that's negative 2 plus minus the square root of b squared that's 4
minus 8 over 2. Don't want to waste too much time on this so that's going to be
negative 4 negative 2 squared or 2i. In other words negative 2 plus minus 2i over 2
leaving me with alpha equals negative 1 and beta equals 1. So x sub c of t is going to equal e to the power
negative x and then we're going to have c sub 1 cosine of just t and c sub 2 sine of t. That is going to be that.
It becomes transient. You can see why. You can see why this is not a steady state
because e to the power negative because of that negative it means it goes in the
denominator and as x gets sufficiently large this is going to approach it at the
limit as x approaches infinity. Well I don't know where this x came from. It's t. Apologies for that.
So x to the power negative t. As t approaches infinity of this function of e to the power negative t that equals 0
because it's 1 over e to the power t and it just approaches 0. So this approaches 0. But now we've just got to do this on the other side. We're just going to assume that x of p of t is going to equal, well that's a cosine and a sine.
So we're going to write cosine of t plus b sine of t. We're going to have the x prime. So p of t that is going to be negative a sine of t plus b cosine of t.
And the x double prime sub p of t is going to be negative a sine of t. So we're going to have this negative a cosine of t minus b sine of t plus 2 this too. So it's negative 2a sine of t plus 2b cosine of t.
And 2 of those. So plus 2a cosine of t plus 2b sine of t. And that is going to equal 4 times the cosine of t and twice the sine of t.
So we're going to have a sine of t. So we're going to have a sine of t. So we can bring out cosine of t as a common factor. That's negative a there.
We have a 2b there. For cosine, for cosine, cosine, cosine in there. Plus 2a is another cosine there. Plus if we take sine of t out we're going to be left with a negative b.
We're going to be left with a negative 2a. Plus 2b. Plus 2b. And that is going to equal as far as the cosine of t is concerned a 4 and the sine of t a 2.
So this looks like these cancel out. So negative b. This is c. Negative 2a negative b. I think I've lost the term. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
That's quite correct. But as far as this is concerned. We have 2b minus 2a. Let's just have a look. If I made a mistake somewhere.
Where did I leave something out. Where did I leave something out. We're going to have negative a. Negative b. Negative 2a. Plus 2b. Plus 2a. Plus 2b.
It looks like it's all correct. So here we're going to have the fact that a. Plus 2b is going to equal 4. That means on this side we're going to have b. Negative 2a is going to equal 2.
So a is going to have 4 minus 2b. So b minus 2 times 4 minus 2b. Equals 2b minus 8. Plus 4b is going to have 2. So 5b is going to have equal 10.
10. And that means b equals 10. And that means b equals 2. And if we look at a. It's got to equal 4 minus 4. That equals 0.
In other words the x of p and t has got to equal 2 times the sine of t.
And if we look at a. And if we look at a. And if we look at a. And if we look at a. And if we put all of these in. That means the x of t is going to equal.
Where is my sub c. That's e to the power. Where are we? It's e to the power. Negative t. Let's bring it out. C sub 1. Cosine of t.
Plus c sub 2. E to the power. Negative t. Sine of t. Plus then this 2 times the sine of t.
But this is an initial value problem. We know that the x of 0 equals 0.
So this is going to be c sub 1. Sines and sines go. So c sub 1 equals 0.
We need to get the x prime of t. And let's do that here.
x prime of t equals of this whole thing here.
We're going to have negative c sub 1 e to the power. Negative t. Cosine of t.
Minus c sub 1 e to the power. Negative t. Sine of t. Product rule there.
Same for this. We're going to have negative.
C sub 2 e to the power. Negative t. Sine of t.
Plus c sub 2 e to the power. Negative t. Cosine of t.
Plus 2 times the cosine of t.
C sub 1 of 0 is going to equal.
x sub 1.
So that's a 1. That's a 1. That's negative c1.
That's c1 is 0 anyway.
So we're just interested in these. That'll be a 0 as well.
That'll be a c sub 2.
And that'll be a plus 2.
In other words, c sub 2 equals x sub 1 minus 2.
I've just put in 0 into all of these t's.
And that's got to be that.
In other words,
x of t has got to equal.
There's an e to the power negative t.
C sub 1 is 0.
So c sub 2 is x sub 1 minus 2.
Sine of t.
Plus 2 times the sine of t.
So this is my transient term.
This is going to go to 0.
And this is going to be my steady state term.
Let's do it.
