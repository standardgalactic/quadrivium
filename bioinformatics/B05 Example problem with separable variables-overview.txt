The text describes solving an initial value problem involving separating variables in functions of \(y\) and \(x\). The goal was to express \(y\) explicitly in terms of \(x\), but it turns out that's not always possible. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step summary:

1. **Separation of Variables**: The differential equation involves separating terms with \(e^{2y} - y\) on one side and \(\sin(2x)\) on the other.

2. **Trigonometric Identity**: Use the identity \(\sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)\) to simplify the integration process.

3. **Integration**: The equation is transformed for integration by dividing terms in the numerator by \(e^y\) and simplifying.

4. **Integration by Parts**: For the term involving \(y e^{-y}\), integration by parts is used, choosing \(u = y\) and \(dv = e^{-y} dy\).

5. **Resulting Equation**: After integrating, an implicit solution is derived: \(e^y + y + \frac{1}{e^y} = 4 - 2\cos(x)\).

6. **Initial Condition**: The initial condition helps solve for the constant \(c_1\), resulting in \(c_1 = 4\).

7. **Implicit Solution**: The final solution is implicit, as explicitly solving for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) is not feasible.

8. **Contour Analysis**: A function \(g(x, y)\) is constructed to analyze the contours where \(g(x, y) = 0\), representing intersections with the xy-plane, though visualizing these curves can be complex.
