The text describes solving an initial value problem involving separating variables in functions of \(y\) and \(x\). The goal was to express \(y\) explicitly in terms of \(x\), but it turns out that's not always possible. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step summary:

1. **Separation of Variables**: The differential equation involves separating terms with \(e^{2y} - y\) on one side and \(\sin(2x)\) on the other.

2. **Trigonometric Identity**: Use the identity \(\sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)\) to simplify the integration process.

3. **Integration**: The equation is transformed for integration by dividing terms in the numerator by \(e^y\) and simplifying.

4. **Integration by Parts**: For the term involving \(y e^{-y}\), integration by parts is used, choosing \(u = y\) and \(dv = e^{-y} dy\).

5. **Resulting Equation**: After integrating, an implicit solution is derived: \(e^y + y + \frac{1}{e^y} = 4 - 2\cos(x)\).

6. **Initial Condition**: The initial condition helps solve for the constant \(c_1\), resulting in \(c_1 = 4\).

7. **Implicit Solution**: The final solution is implicit, as explicitly solving for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) is not feasible.

8. **Contour Analysis**: A function \(g(x, y)\) is constructed to analyze the contours where \(g(x, y) = 0\), representing intersections with the xy-plane, though visualizing these curves can be complex.

The text discusses solving an initial value problem involving separating variables in functions of \( y \) and \( x \). It emphasizes that not all solutions can be explicitly expressed with \( y \) solely in terms of \( x \). The process begins by separating the equation into parts: one involving \( y \) on one side and another involving \( x \) on the other. This leads to an integral setup requiring integration by parts due to its complexity.

The integration results in an implicit solution, as isolating \( y \) explicitly is deemed impossible for this specific problem. An initial condition is applied to solve for a constant, resulting in a final implicit equation relating \( y \) and \( x \). The text concludes with constructing a function involving \( g(x, y) = 0 \), representing the contour where the solution intersects the xy-plane, though it acknowledges the difficulty of visualizing this curve directly.
