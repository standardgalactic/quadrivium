Let us look at the circuit problem then. Here we have a battery with an internal resistance.
There is our one battery. It goes in a circuit. And down. Here is another battery.
Internal resistance is another resistor. There we go. We are given that this is point A.
We are given that the electromotive force of this battery number 1. So this will be battery number 1.
This will be battery number 2. So E1 we are given as 4.4 volts.
And E2 equals 2.1 volts. We are given that the internal resistance here is 2.3 ohm.
Like this. 2.3 ohm. And R2 is going to equal 1.8 ohm.
And we are given that this big resistor here has got 5.5 ohm resistance.
Question 1. What is the current high in the circuit? First of all there is no fork in the road.
In other words the current is going to be exactly the same anyway in the circuit.
That is the most important thing to remember.
Now let us have a look at what happens. In what direction is the current going to flow?
Now clearly this battery has a much bigger potential difference than that one.
So we would suggest that the current flows in this direction.
It starts at point VA. As we travel along, remember if we get back to point VA,
the change in potential difference should be zero.
So first of all here we are going to go from a higher to a lower.
So we are going to get negative E2. With the current the resistor is going to lower the potential difference.
So that is going to be minus IR2. Again with the current the resistor will lower the potential.
So that is minus IR. Here we come to another resistor. So that is minus IR2.
And then we go from lower to higher potential. So the potential difference actually increases there.
And there is E1. So this is all going to equal, that all has to equal E0.
So we can say that E1 minus E2 equals, bring out the I's all on the other side, and that is going to be R1 plus R2.
In other words, I is going to equal E1 minus E1 minus E2 divided by R plus R1 plus R2.
So that is quite simple to do.
So the second question here, what is the potential difference between the terminals of battery 1?
So we are just going to go across the terminals of battery 1.
With the current flowing in this direction, let's call this then point A and this point B.
So that will be the potential difference over the terminals which will be there and there.
So if we start with VA, we are going to go with the current, so that is minus IR1 from the lower to a higher potential.
So that is plus E1 and that is going to equal VB.
So we have that VB minus VA is going to equal E1 minus IR1.
And we certainly know what E1 is, 4.4 volt, and we know now what the current is through our equation here.
And we were given the resistance one which was 2.3 ohm.
So the potential difference across these terminals is also quite easy to do.
Just so that we know that we fully understand the potential difference of the terminals of the battery,
we are told that the EMF in our battery is 12 volt and the internal resistance is 2 ohm.
And first of all it is asked, is the terminal to terminal potential difference greater than,
less than or equal to 12 volt if the current in the battery is from negative to the positive terminal?
So in other words now our current goes in this direction.
Now let us just call the one side, there will be a potential here, electric potential of A,
and there will be a potential different, potential of B, electric potential of B.
So with the current, so let us say VA, now we go with the current, so that is going to decrease,
minus IR from a lower to a higher potential, so that is plus E, and that is going to equal VB.
So VB minus VA has got to be E minus IR, and as E was 12, that means with the current,
the potential now on the terminals, if the current goes in that direction, will be lower than 12 volt.
Ok, let us reverse direction.
Now we are going to have the current run in this direction.
The current now runs in this direction.
Let us again go from VA.
So VA, now against the current, this is going to increase the potential difference,
from, again from a lower to a higher, will increase the electric potential, and that is going to equal VB.
So once again, I am going to have VB minus VA, is now E plus IR.
So that will be higher than 12 volt.
The potential difference across this battery is going to be higher than 12 volt, if the current is in this direction.
And if there is no current whatsoever, what is the potential difference?
There is no current, what is the potential difference across here?
Well, this is the potential difference across our EMF.
So this is going to equal VB minus VA.
It is going to equal E.
Because I is zero.
I is zero.
So that is going to be exactly 12 volt.
In this problem, let's see if we really understand kilowatt hours and power delivery and cost.
So we are told a standard flashlight battery can deliver 2 watt hours.
2.0 watt hours until it is flat.
What does that mean?
Just rewrite it in SI units.
2.0 watt is joule per second hours.
1 hour is 3600 seconds.
So, how much energy are we going to get from this?
2 times 3600.
So we are going to get 7200 joules from that battery.
That is what it means.
Now, if a battery costs 80 cents, so it is 80 cents for a battery.
What is the cost of operating a 100 watt lamp for 8 hours using these batteries?
So, again we get to have 100 joules per second.
That means 100 watt.
Then we get to run it for 8 hours, times 8 hours.
So that is 8, times 3600.
So we need our calculator for that.
Let's have a look.
So that is 100, times 8 hours, times 3600 seconds of an hour.
So we are left with 2.88 million joules.
Seconds there and then.
So that is what this 100 watt light bulb of ours is going to take this amount of energy in 8 hours.
From one little battery we only get 7200.
So how many batteries do we need?
28800000 divided by 7200 batteries.
So divided by 7200 that leaves us we need 400 batteries.
We need 400 batteries.
At a cost of 80 cents times 0.8.
That is going to cost us 320 now using whatever the currency is that you are using.
320 if there is 100 cents in one of your currency units.
Now let's have a look.
What is the cost if energy is provided at the rate of 6 cents per kilowatt hour.
So now we are going to have 6 cents per kilowatt hour.
So there is 1000 joules per second hour which is 3600 seconds.
So 1000, so 6 cents is going to give us how much energy?
1000 times 3600 that is 3600000 joules.
So that will cost us 6 cents.
We need to run our 100 watt light bulb for 8 hours.
Meaning we need so many joules.
2.88 million.
And if that costs us 60 cents we will have this divided by this times that.
So 2.880000 divided by 3600000 times 0.06.
And that is going to cost us a measly 4.8 cents.
Versus 320 of whatever your currency is.
If as I say there is 100 cents in one of your currency.
So that is dollars or whatever the case might be.
So much cheaper if you are paying 6 cents per kilowatt hour.
Versus 80 cents for a battery that only gives you 7200 joules.
