The text discusses the concept of line integrals with respect to coordinate variables (x and y) in a plane, contrasting it with line integrals with respect to arc length (ds). In the previous context, a line integral summed up small lengths along a curve without regard to direction. However, when integrating with respect to x or y coordinates:

1. **Parametrization**: The curve is parametrized by a vector function \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))\).

2. **Derivatives**: We compute the derivatives \(x'(t)\) and \(y'(t)\), which represent rates of change with respect to the parameter t.

3. **Differentials**: The differentials are expressed as \(dx = x'(t) dt\) and \(dy = y'(t) dt\).

4. **Integral Expression**: For a function \(f(x, y)\), the line integral in terms of x or y is computed over an interval \([t_1, t_2]\):
   - The integral with respect to x involves integrating \(f(\mathbf{r}(t))x'(t) dt\).
   - Similarly, for y, it involves integrating \(f(\mathbf{r}(t))y'(t) dt\).

5. **Direction Sensitivity**: Unlike the arc length integral where direction did not matter (since ds is always positive), line integrals with respect to x or y are sensitive to direction:
   - Positive contributions occur when moving in a positive coordinate direction.
   - Negative contributions arise when moving in the negative coordinate direction.

Overall, this approach examines how changes in each coordinate individually contribute to the integral, which can vary based on the curve's traversal direction.

The text discusses the concept of line integrals, specifically comparing those with respect to arc length and those with respect to coordinate variables. Initially, a line integral was described as summing small lengths along a curve, using \( ds \) which is derived from \( \sqrt{(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2} dt \). This approach considers the magnitude of infinitesimal segments irrespective of direction.

Now, the focus shifts to line integrals with respect to coordinate variables. Here, instead of considering arc length, changes in \( x \) and \( y \) directions are considered separately. The parameterization involves a vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t)) \). Its derivatives yield \( dx/dt = x'(t) \) and \( dy/dt = y'(t) \), allowing the differentials to be expressed as \( dx = x'(t) dt \) and \( dy = y'(t) dt \).

In this context, for a function \( f(x, y) \), the line integral is evaluated over a curve parameterized from \( t_1 \) to \( t_2 \). The outcome of such an integration depends on the direction along the curve: positive or negative contributions arise based on whether increments in \( x \) and \( y \) are increasing or decreasing as the parameter \( t \) progresses. Unlike with arc length, here the sign (positive or negative) matters because it reflects the orientation of movement along the path. This is illustrated by considering a curve where moving from one point to another in opposite directions yields different slopes and thus different integral results depending on directionality.
