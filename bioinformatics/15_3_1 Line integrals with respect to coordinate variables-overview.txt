The text discusses the concept of line integrals with respect to coordinate variables (x and y) in a plane, contrasting it with line integrals with respect to arc length (ds). In the previous context, a line integral summed up small lengths along a curve without regard to direction. However, when integrating with respect to x or y coordinates:

1. **Parametrization**: The curve is parametrized by a vector function \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))\).

2. **Derivatives**: We compute the derivatives \(x'(t)\) and \(y'(t)\), which represent rates of change with respect to the parameter t.

3. **Differentials**: The differentials are expressed as \(dx = x'(t) dt\) and \(dy = y'(t) dt\).

4. **Integral Expression**: For a function \(f(x, y)\), the line integral in terms of x or y is computed over an interval \([t_1, t_2]\):
   - The integral with respect to x involves integrating \(f(\mathbf{r}(t))x'(t) dt\).
   - Similarly, for y, it involves integrating \(f(\mathbf{r}(t))y'(t) dt\).

5. **Direction Sensitivity**: Unlike the arc length integral where direction did not matter (since ds is always positive), line integrals with respect to x or y are sensitive to direction:
   - Positive contributions occur when moving in a positive coordinate direction.
   - Negative contributions arise when moving in the negative coordinate direction.

Overall, this approach examines how changes in each coordinate individually contribute to the integral, which can vary based on the curve's traversal direction.
