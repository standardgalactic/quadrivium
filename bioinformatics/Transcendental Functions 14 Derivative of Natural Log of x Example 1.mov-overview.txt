To find the first derivative of the natural logarithm function \(\ln(x^2 + 3)\), we apply the chain rule. First, ensure that \(x^2 + 3 > 0\) to keep the logarithm defined. Define:

- \(y = \ln(x^2 + 3)\)
- \(u = x^2 + 3\)

Using the chain rule, \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}\).

1. Calculate \(\frac{dy}{du}\):
   - Since \(y = \ln(u)\), \(\frac{dy}{du} = \frac{1}{u}\).

2. Calculate \(\frac{du}{dx}\):
   - Given \(u = x^2 + 3\), \(\frac{du}{dx} = 2x\).

Substitute back into the chain rule formula:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{u} \cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 3}
\]

Thus, the first derivative of \(\ln(x^2 + 3)\) is \(\frac{2x}{x^2 + 3}\).
