This text provides a comprehensive overview of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including its natural history, propagation, and preventive strategies. VTE comprises deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), both potentially leading to severe health issues or death if left untreated. DVT often begins in the calf muscle veins.

Challenges exist in understanding how DVT progresses to PE, as some PEs occur without visible DVT spread beyond the knee. While about 70% of DVT cases resolve within six months through ultrasound monitoring, many patients suffer lasting vascular damage.

The treatment for PE is urgent due to high early mortality risks and focuses on long-term management influenced by conditions like cancer or significant trauma. Prophylactic measures aim to reduce VTE's impact by identifying at-risk individuals and applying appropriate prevention methods, such as unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), warfarin, antiplatelet agents, compression stockings, and IVC filters.

Research favors LMWH over unfractionated heparin for prophylaxis due to its efficacy and reduced bleeding risk. In surgeries with high bleeding risks, alternatives like compression stockings are preferred. The VTE risk extends beyond hospital discharge, indicating potential benefits from continued prophylaxis in certain patients.

Guidelines help identify individuals needing prophylaxis across various contexts, including those with cancer. Additional resources like pamphlets and apps support healthcare providers in assessing patient risk for tailored VTE prevention strategies.
