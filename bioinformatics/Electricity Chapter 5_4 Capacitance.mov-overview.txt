The text describes solving problems related to capacitors in electrical circuits, focusing on charge distribution and energy stored. Here's a summary:

1. **Charge Calculation**: 
   - Given a potential difference of 12.5 volts across a battery, the goal is to find the charge on capacitor one.
   - Using \( Q = CV \), where \( C \) is the equivalent capacitance (3.57 × 10^-6 F) and \( V \) is 12.5 volts, the total charge is calculated as 4.4625 × 10^-5 coulombs.

2. **Charge Distribution**:
   - The capacitors are divided into equivalents \( C_{1,2} \) and \( C_3 \).
   - Charge remains constant across these configurations.
   - Voltage changes due to the circuit configuration, with calculations for voltage across specific capacitor combinations using \( V = Q/C \).

3. **Parallel Capacitor Configuration**:
   - In parallel, voltage remains constant across capacitors.
   - The charge on a specific capacitor (\( Q_1 \)) is found by multiplying its capacitance by this common voltage.

4. **Non-Standard Configurations**:
   - A scenario where two capacitors are neither in series nor parallel is discussed.
   - Initial charges remain unchanged as no battery is present to alter them.
   - The final voltage across each capacitor can be derived using \( V = C_1V_0 / (C_1 + C_2) \).

5. **Energy Stored**:
   - Energy stored in a capacitor is the work done to move charges, calculated as \( W = \int q dq/C \).
   - The energy stored is given by \( U = Q^2/(2C) \), where \( Q \) is the charge and \( C \) is the capacitance.

This explanation covers the methods for calculating charge distribution and energy storage in capacitors within different circuit configurations.

The text explains that the work performed on an electrical system results in the storage of electric potential energy. This energy is specifically stored within a capacitor. The explanation suggests that further elaboration or rewriting of this concept will be covered in the subsequent video or segment.
