To find the indefinite integrals of the tangent and secant functions, we explore their integration using substitution and clever manipulation.

1. **Indefinite Integral of Tangent of \( x \):**
   - Rewrite \(\tan(x)\) as \(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\).
   - Use substitution: Let \( u = \cos(x) \). Then, \( du = -\sin(x) dx \), so \(-du = \sin(x) dx\).
   - The integral becomes:
     \[
     \int \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \, dx = \int \frac{-1}{u} \, du
     \]
   - This evaluates to:
     \[
     -\ln|u| + C = -\ln|\cos(x)| + C
     \]

2. **Indefinite Integral of Secant of \( x \):**
   - Direct substitution as \(\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\) is not helpful.
   - Use a clever method involving the derivative of \(\tan(x) + \sec(x)\).
   - Recognize that:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx} (\tan(x) + \sec(x)) = \sec^2(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)
     \]
   - Let \( u = \tan(x) + \sec(x) \), then \( du = (\sec^2(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)) dx \).
   - Notice that:
     \[
     \frac{du}{u} = \sec(x) \, dx
     \]
   - Integrate using the logarithmic derivative:
     \[
     \int \sec(x) \, dx = \ln|u| + C = \ln|\tan(x) + \sec(x)| + C
     \]

These steps outline how to integrate \(\tan(x)\) and \(\sec(x)\) effectively.

This text outlines a mathematical process for integrating the secant function. It begins by setting up an equation involving \(\sec(x)\) and \(\tan(xy)\). Through substitution, it identifies \(u\) as \(\sec(x) + \tan(x)\), leading to \(\frac{du}{dx} = \sec(x)(\tan(x) + \sec(x))\).

By integrating both sides with respect to \(x\), the left side becomes the original problem: \(\int \sec(x) \, dx\). The right side simplifies as it involves taking the integral of a derivative, which cancels out to leave \(\ln|\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C\).

The text highlights how mathematicians like Newton and Leibniz used lateral thinking to derive this result, emphasizing the creative problem-solving required in mathematics. The final expression for the integral is:

\[
\int \sec(x) \, dx = \ln|\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C
\]
