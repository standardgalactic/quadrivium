To find the indefinite integrals of the tangent and secant functions, we explore their integration using substitution and clever manipulation.

1. **Indefinite Integral of Tangent of \( x \):**
   - Rewrite \(\tan(x)\) as \(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\).
   - Use substitution: Let \( u = \cos(x) \). Then, \( du = -\sin(x) dx \), so \(-du = \sin(x) dx\).
   - The integral becomes:
     \[
     \int \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \, dx = \int \frac{-1}{u} \, du
     \]
   - This evaluates to:
     \[
     -\ln|u| + C = -\ln|\cos(x)| + C
     \]

2. **Indefinite Integral of Secant of \( x \):**
   - Direct substitution as \(\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\) is not helpful.
   - Use a clever method involving the derivative of \(\tan(x) + \sec(x)\).
   - Recognize that:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx} (\tan(x) + \sec(x)) = \sec^2(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)
     \]
   - Let \( u = \tan(x) + \sec(x) \), then \( du = (\sec^2(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)) dx \).
   - Notice that:
     \[
     \frac{du}{u} = \sec(x) \, dx
     \]
   - Integrate using the logarithmic derivative:
     \[
     \int \sec(x) \, dx = \ln|u| + C = \ln|\tan(x) + \sec(x)| + C
     \]

These steps outline how to integrate \(\tan(x)\) and \(\sec(x)\) effectively.

This text outlines a mathematical process for integrating the secant function. It begins by setting up an equation involving \(\sec(x)\) and \(\tan(xy)\). Through substitution, it identifies \(u\) as \(\sec(x) + \tan(x)\), leading to \(\frac{du}{dx} = \sec(x)(\tan(x) + \sec(x))\).

By integrating both sides with respect to \(x\), the left side becomes the original problem: \(\int \sec(x) \, dx\). The right side simplifies as it involves taking the integral of a derivative, which cancels out to leave \(\ln|\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C\).

The text highlights how mathematicians like Newton and Leibniz used lateral thinking to derive this result, emphasizing the creative problem-solving required in mathematics. The final expression for the integral is:

\[
\int \sec(x) \, dx = \ln|\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C
\]

The text describes the process of finding the indefinite integrals of tangent and secant functions with respect to \( x \).

1. **Integral of Tangent**:
   - The integral of \( \tan(x) \) is simplified by expressing it as \( \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \).
   - Using substitution, let \( u = \cos(x) \), then \( du = -\sin(x) \, dx \). 
   - This transforms the integral to \( -\int \frac{1}{u} \, du \), which evaluates to \( -\ln|\cos(x)| + C \).

2. **Integral of Secant**:
   - Direct substitution for secant is ineffective, so a clever method involving the derivative of \( \tan(x) + \sec(x) \) is used.
   - The derivative of this expression simplifies to \( \sec(x)(\tan(x) + \sec(x)) \).
   - By letting \( u = \tan(x) + \sec(x) \), it follows that \( \frac{du}{dx} = \sec(x)(\tan(x) + \sec(x)) \), or \( du = \sec(x)u \, dx \).
   - This implies \( \int \sec(x) \, dx = \ln|u| + C = \ln|\tan(x) + \sec(x)| + C \).

The text emphasizes using substitution and recognizing patterns in derivatives to solve these integrals.

The text describes a mathematical process involving calculus, specifically integration and differentiation. It starts with an expression involving the secant of \( x \) and the tangent of \( xy \). The goal is to find the integral of the secant function.

1. **Expression Setup**: The expression involves the secant of \( x \) and tangent of \( xy \).

2. **Substitution**: A substitution is made where \( u = \sec(x) + \tan(xy) \), leading to an expression \( \frac{u'}{u} \).

3. **Derivation**: It's shown that \( \frac{u'}{u} \) equals the derivative with respect to \( x \) of the natural logarithm of \( u \). This is a standard result from calculus, where the derivative of \( \ln(u) \) is \( \frac{u'}{u} \).

4. **Integration**: The text then integrates both sides with respect to \( x \). On the left side, it simplifies to the original integral problem: finding the indefinite integral of the secant of \( x \).

5. **Solution**: Through integration, the solution is found to be the natural logarithm of the secant of \( x \) plus the tangent of \( x \), plus a constant \( c \).

6. **Historical Context**: The text also reflects on how mathematicians like Newton and Leibniz might have used lateral thinking to solve such problems in their time.

In summary, the process involves using substitution and properties of logarithms and derivatives to find the integral of the secant function, resulting in a solution involving natural logarithms.
