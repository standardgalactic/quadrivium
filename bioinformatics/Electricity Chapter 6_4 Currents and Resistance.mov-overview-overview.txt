The text discusses the effects of lightning striking the earth and its impact on a nearby person, particularly focusing on how it creates an electric current that spreads in a half-sphere pattern from the strike point. When a person stands with their feet apart by distance \( \Delta r = d \), they form part of an electrical circuit due to body resistance.

The main focus is calculating the potential difference (\(\Delta V\)) across the person's feet, which involves integrating the electric field over the distance between their feet. The electric field (\(E\)) is defined as:

\[ E = \frac{\rho I}{2 \pi r^2} \]

where \(\rho\) is resistivity, \(I\) is current, and \(r\) is the radius from the strike point. The potential difference is found by integrating this expression over the distance between the feet:

\[ \Delta V = -\int_{d}^{d + \Delta r} \frac{\rho I}{2 \pi r^2} \, dr \]

This shows that a smaller distance (\(\Delta r\)) between feet results in a reduced current through the body.

The text also explains Ohm's Law, emphasizing its role in defining a linear relationship between current and potential difference for materials that follow it. It clarifies that Ohm's Law indicates a constant gradient of current versus potential difference rather than defining \(I = V/R\).

Additionally, the text covers power in electric circuits, relating energy (\(U\)) to charge (\(q\)), current (\(i\)), and voltage (\(v\)). The power dissipated as thermal energy in a resistor is given by:

\[ P = iv \]

For resistors, this can be expressed using Ohm's Law in two forms:

1. \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \)
2. \( P = I^2 R \)

These equations describe how energy is converted into heat in resistive components.
