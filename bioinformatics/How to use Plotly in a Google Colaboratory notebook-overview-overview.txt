This tutorial demonstrates how to use Plotly in Google Colab by starting with a new Jupyter notebook as a Colaboratory file on Google Drive. It highlights that Plotly is pre-loaded, simplifying its import and usage. The steps include importing packages like `numpy`, `scipy.stats` for data simulation, and specific functions from `plotly.offline`. Additionally, it covers the need to import `graph_objects` as `go`.

Key points in the tutorial are:
1. Configuring each cell that renders a Plotly graph by defining and calling a function named `configure_plotly_browser_state`, which uses IPython's display capabilities.
2. Generating simulated data (white cell count) using a normal distribution, setting up a histogram plot with `go.Histogram`, customizing the layout, and rendering it using `iPlot`.
3. Practical tips for executing cells and ensuring Plotly graphs display correctly by copying predefined code snippets into each relevant cell.

The tutorial focuses on integrating Plotly seamlessly within Colab notebooks through these steps.
