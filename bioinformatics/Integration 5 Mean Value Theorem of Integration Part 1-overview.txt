The text discusses the Mean Value Theorem for Integration, which parallels the Mean Value Theorem in differentiation. It explains how this theorem applies to finding an average value of a continuous function over a closed interval \([a, b]\). 

Key points include:

- The definite integral from \(a\) to \(b\) of a function \(f(x)\) represents the area under the curve on that interval.
- This is similar to calculating areas using Riemann sums with infinitely many rectangles, each having a base width and height corresponding to the function's values at various points along the interval.
- There exists an average value of the function over \([a, b]\), denoted as \(f(c)\) for some \(c\) in \([a, b]\).
- The average value is calculated by dividing the definite integral by the length of the interval (\(b-a\)).
- Geometrically, this theorem states that there exists a point \(c\) such that a rectangle with base width \(b-a\) and height \(f(c)\) has the same area as the area under the curve from \(a\) to \(b\).

In essence, the Mean Value Theorem for Integration provides a way to equate the average value of a function over an interval to a specific function value at some point within that interval.
