The text discusses the Mean Value Theorem for Integration, which parallels the Mean Value Theorem in differentiation. It explains how this theorem applies to finding an average value of a continuous function over a closed interval \([a, b]\). 

Key points include:

- The definite integral from \(a\) to \(b\) of a function \(f(x)\) represents the area under the curve on that interval.
- This is similar to calculating areas using Riemann sums with infinitely many rectangles, each having a base width and height corresponding to the function's values at various points along the interval.
- There exists an average value of the function over \([a, b]\), denoted as \(f(c)\) for some \(c\) in \([a, b]\).
- The average value is calculated by dividing the definite integral by the length of the interval (\(b-a\)).
- Geometrically, this theorem states that there exists a point \(c\) such that a rectangle with base width \(b-a\) and height \(f(c)\) has the same area as the area under the curve from \(a\) to \(b\).

In essence, the Mean Value Theorem for Integration provides a way to equate the average value of a function over an interval to a specific function value at some point within that interval.

The text explains the mean value theorem of integration, which is analogous to the mean value theorem of differentiation. It describes how, for a continuous function \( f(x) \) over a closed interval \([a, b]\), there exists an average value that the function reaches at some point within the interval.

This average value can be expressed as:

\[
f(c) = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
\]

where \( c \) is a point in the interval \([a, b]\). Geometrically, this means there exists a rectangle with width \( b-a \) and height \( f(c) \) that has the same area as the area under the curve of \( f(x) \) from \( a \) to \( b \). This theorem highlights how an average value of a function over an interval corresponds to the area under its curve.
