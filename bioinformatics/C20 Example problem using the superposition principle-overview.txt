The text explains how to solve a non-homogeneous, linear, third-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution consists of two parts: the complementary (homogeneous) solution and the particular solution.

1. **Complementary Solution**:
   - Transform the given non-homogeneous equation into a homogeneous one: \( y''' - 3y'' + 3y' - y = 0 \).
   - Use the auxiliary equation \( m^3 - 3m^2 + 3m - 1 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (m-1)^3 = 0 \). This indicates a triple root at \( m=1 \).
   - The complementary solution is formed as: 
     \[
     y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x + c_3 x^2 e^x
     \]
   where \( c_1, c_2, \) and \( c_3 \) are constants.

2. **Particular Solution**:
   - The non-homogeneous term is \( (x - 4)e^x \).
   - Assume a particular solution of the form: 
     \[
     y_p = ax + b + cx^3 e^x
     \]
   - Differentiate and substitute into the original equation to find coefficients by equating terms:
     - Solving gives \( a = -1, b = -3, c = -\frac{2}{3} \).
   - Thus, the particular solution is: 
     \[
     y_p = -x - 3 - \frac{2}{3} x^3 e^x
     \]

3. **General Solution**:
   - Combine both solutions to form the general solution:
     \[
     y = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x + c_3 x^2 e^x - x - 3 - \frac{2}{3} x^3 e^x
     \]

This methodically solves the differential equation by addressing both the homogeneous and non-homogeneous components.
