The text explains how to solve a non-homogeneous, linear, third-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution consists of two parts: the complementary (homogeneous) solution and the particular solution.

1. **Complementary Solution**:
   - Transform the given non-homogeneous equation into a homogeneous one: \( y''' - 3y'' + 3y' - y = 0 \).
   - Use the auxiliary equation \( m^3 - 3m^2 + 3m - 1 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (m-1)^3 = 0 \). This indicates a triple root at \( m=1 \).
   - The complementary solution is formed as: 
     \[
     y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x + c_3 x^2 e^x
     \]
   where \( c_1, c_2, \) and \( c_3 \) are constants.

2. **Particular Solution**:
   - The non-homogeneous term is \( (x - 4)e^x \).
   - Assume a particular solution of the form: 
     \[
     y_p = ax + b + cx^3 e^x
     \]
   - Differentiate and substitute into the original equation to find coefficients by equating terms:
     - Solving gives \( a = -1, b = -3, c = -\frac{2}{3} \).
   - Thus, the particular solution is: 
     \[
     y_p = -x - 3 - \frac{2}{3} x^3 e^x
     \]

3. **General Solution**:
   - Combine both solutions to form the general solution:
     \[
     y = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x + c_3 x^2 e^x - x - 3 - \frac{2}{3} x^3 e^x
     \]

This methodically solves the differential equation by addressing both the homogeneous and non-homogeneous components.

The text provides an explanation of how to solve a non-homogeneous, linear, third-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution consists of a complementary part and a particular part.

1. **Complementary Solution:**
   - Start by converting the given equation into a homogeneous form: \( y''' - 3y'' + 3y' - y = 0 \).
   - Use the auxiliary equation: \( m^3 - 3m^2 + 3m - 1 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (m-1)^3 = 0 \).
   - The roots are \( m_1 = m_2 = m_3 = 1 \).
   - The complementary solution is: \( y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x + c_3 x^2 e^x \).

2. **Particular Solution:**
   - The non-homogeneous part is \( x - 4e^x \), consisting of two components.
   - For the \( x \) term, assume a particular solution of the form \( y_p = Ax + B \).
   - For the \( e^x \) term, since it overlaps with the complementary solution, try \( y_{p2} = Cx^3 e^x \).
   - Substitute these into the differential equation and solve for coefficients \( A, B, \) and \( C \).

3. **Solving for Coefficients:**
   - From substituting and equating terms, find:
     - \( A = -1 \)
     - \( B = -3 \)
     - \( C = -\frac{2}{3} \)

4. **General Solution:**
   - Combine the complementary and particular solutions:
   \[
   y = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x + c_3 x^2 e^x - x - 3 - \frac{2}{3} x^3 e^x
   \]
This is the complete general solution to the differential equation.
