Now I want to explain two ways of looking at linear equations to put into perspective what we have learned until now.
The two ways are the row and the column views.
And we can use each of these views to solve a linear set or a set of linear equations.
That means we're going to look at a matrix or look at a linear set in its row form and in its column form.
There is a third way and that is the algebraic way, using manipulations of the matrix as a mathematical object.
We'll look at this later.
Let's start with the row picture.
We'll start with two equations, namely x plus 2y equals 8 and 3x minus y equals 3.
We can plot these as two straight lines on a 2d coordinate plane and where the lines cross we can read our answers, as we can see here.
We have plotted these values from each equation and drew these two lines.
They cross at x equals 2 and y equals 3.
A more interesting way is the column view.
First, we'll write our matrix of coefficients, 1 and 2 and 3 and negative 1.
We can also write it in this form, called the augmented matrix.
We add the right hand side of the equations.
We can also rewrite the matrix to look like this.
This is the vector form.
We have the matrix of coefficients, then a column vector with which the coefficient matrix is multiplied, called vector x, to give the answer, which is also a column vector called vector b.
Just to check whether this is correct, let us multiply these and see if we can get the original two equations.
We are multiplying a 2 by 2 matrix with a 1 by 1 matrix, so we'll get a 2 by 1 matrix.
1 and 2 and x and y, this gives us x plus 2y, which is our first equation.
And 3 and negative 1 and x and y, and this gives us our second equation, 3x minus y.
From the matrix of coefficients, we can create two column vectors and write it like this.
It asks, how many of vector 1 must be added to how many of vector 2 to give vector 3?
Let us draw the vectors, vector 1 and vector 2 and the answer vector 3.
Look at this, it takes 2 of vector 1 to be added to 3 of vector 2 to give vector 3.
In other words, x equals 2 and y equals 3.
Another reason we use this vector format or column view is that we know how to do inverses.
If I have a times x equals b and I multiply both sides by a to the power negative 1 or the inverse of a,
I get x equals a inverse times b.
I can thus solve for the column vector x and get the answers to x and y.
Thanks so much.
Thank you very much.
