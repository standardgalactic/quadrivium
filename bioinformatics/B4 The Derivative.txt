So we've just looked at the power rule that is very ubiquitous in what we're going to do in
biomathematics so we might as well know that. We're not really I think in this course going
to deal with very complicated derivatives so at least that is important to know what we will
deal with probably is the product rule and let's have that here the product product rule
and that is if we have f and x being two functions of x. Let's have an example we're going to have y
equals let's have let's have x times the sine of x x times the sine of x so that is a function of x
so we can say here that the g of x equals x and the h of x equals the sine of x. I've got two
functions in x and they multiply it by each other and we call that the chain rule which is
the derivative of the first one times the second one plus the second one times the derivative plus
the first one times the derivative of the second one which we've written out there and that's an
important thing to remember. It's easier maybe to write it in another way let's also call this
let's call this one of the function u and we call this one the function v so that y equals u times v
with a function of x and another function of x so that y prime equals u prime v plus u v prime.
It's an easier way to remember it than this convoluted method although that's really not difficult.
So we're just going to take the derivative of each one of them and multiply it with the other one
successively so in a different format. Now let's go to the quotient rule so if we have two functions
divided by each other so let's just come let's just complete this example so for this example y prime
was going to be u prime so the prime of this which is just one times this which is the sine of x
plus this times the derivative of that which is the cosine of x so that's x cosine of x and there we go
easy as well it's easy if i have two functions divided by each other remember then that the function
cannot equal zero we can't divide by zero now let's just call them u and v again so that is going to be
u divided by v which represents g of x and h of x so this is yeah it doesn't matter which way around
you take it because you you're adding these two so if you had u v prime plus u prime v it doesn't
matter which way around it is here it does make a big difference i'm not going to do a video on how
we derive this you can just watch some video on on derivatives calculus calculus and to see how we
get to this but it's important to remember that it's the derivative of the function in the numerator
comes first so that is u prime v minus u v prime divided by and then this is just v squared so we
take whatever is in the in the denominator and we just square it so it must be it must be it must be
in this uh in this form it is the derivative of the numerator times the denominator minus the
minus the denominator times the derivative now i'm getting all confused so there's the numerator and
the denominator so it's the derivative of the numerator times the denominator minus the numerator
times the derivative of the of the denominator divided by the denominator squared and then lastly we
have what we call the chain rule so this was the quotient rule we have here quotient
rule and here we're going to have the chain rule so we have a function within a function
so for instance i would have the sine of x cubed
so it's a function the sine of some variable but that variable is a function on its own
and how do we do this well we take the derivative just of the function and we imagine this just to be
something else what we usually say is u equals x cubed so we can then write this as the sine of u
and the derivative of that if y equals that if y equals that then y prime equals well that's just
the cosine of u but i've got got to multiply that now by the derivative of this function as well which
is going to be three x squared three x squared now i just have to back substitute so that's the cosine
of x cubed which is what u was times three x squared in other words three x squared cosine of x cubed and
that is the quotient rule the chain rule
