The text describes a Doppler effect problem involving sound measurements. In this experiment:

- The speed of sound in air is measured at 340 m/s.
- A tuning fork with a frequency of 400 Hz moves away from an observer toward a wall at 2 m/s.

**Direct Sound:**
1. To find the apparent frequency heard by the observer directly from the tuning fork:
   - Observer's velocity = 0 (since they are stationary).
   - Tuning fork's velocity = +2 m/s (away from observer).
   - Using the Doppler effect formula for a source moving away from an observer, the apparent frequency is calculated as: 
     \[
     f' = f \times \frac{v}{v + v_s} = 400 \times \frac{340}{342} \approx 398 \text{ Hz}
     \]

**Reflected Sound:**
2. For the sound wave reflecting off the wall:
   - The wall acts as a new source, with the tuning fork's velocity effectively reversed.
   - Observer remains stationary (0 m/s).
   - New effective velocity of source (wall) = -2 m/s (towards observer after reflection).
   - Calculate apparent frequency using Doppler effect for sound approaching a stationary observer:
     \[
     f'' = 398 \times \frac{340}{338} \approx 402.4 \text{ Hz}
     \]

**Beat Frequency:**
3. The beat frequency (difference between direct and reflected frequencies) is approximately 4.7 beats per second:
   - Direct sound frequency ≈ 397.7 Hz
   - Reflected sound frequency ≈ 402.4 Hz
   - Beat frequency = |402.4 - 397.7| ≈ 4.7 Hz

The text ends with a mention of another problem involving two sources and an observer, requiring further analysis for specific values of L1 (the length between the sources).

The text discusses wave interference, particularly focusing on conditions for constructive interference when waves from two sources, S1 and S2, meet. When both waves are in phase (i.e., their path lengths L1 and L2 are equal), they interfere constructively, doubling the amplitude at the point of superposition.

If L1 equals L2, then there is zero difference between the path lengths (L1 - L2 = 0), resulting in maximum constructive interference. The text also considers scenarios where L1 differs from L2. For constructive interference to occur under these conditions, the difference between the path lengths (|L1 - L2|) must be an integer multiple of the wavelength. This ensures that the waves align perfectly when one wave is moved by whole wavelengths relative to the other.

In essence, for maximum constructive interference at a point where two waves meet:
- The path length difference can be zero or any integer multiple of the wavelength (nλ, where n is an integer).
