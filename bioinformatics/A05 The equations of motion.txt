Now, let me give you your first tiny, tiny, tiny little example of a symmetry principle.
Symmetry, symmetry principle.
So I'm going to state a kind of symmetry. I'm going to invent one.
And as I said, anywhere where there's a symmetry principle, a conserved quantity hides.
So, let's consider a system where all forces, forces are radial.
Can I give you an example of that? Yes.
Here's the sun.
And there's a gravitational force in all the forces, no matter where you are,
the force is going to be towards the center.
It's going to be towards the center, no matter where you are.
All the forces are radial.
So they sit on this radius.
So anyway, there, there is a symmetry here.
And I call it a radial symmetry.
Now, it's difficult for me really to put in words what is symmetrical here.
But it should be plain to understand that if I create this system of radial,
all the forces being radial, there's no force anywhere else here that points in another direction.
All the force forces in this area points towards the same spot.
That's the symmetry.
I have set a symmetry principle.
Now, you might remember angular momentum equals the cross product of a radius vector and a momentum vector.
Angular momentum is this cross product.
So, if this is a vector and this is a vector,
you should know or you have to know how to do the cross product of two vectors.
It's a special kind of multiplication.
It gives us another vector as an answer as opposed to a scalar, which you get through a dot product.
And you have to have done some linear algebra.
You must know how to take a vector and do a cross product with another vector.
Very easy to get the direction.
Difficult.
You have to know how to do it to get the magnitude of this.
The direction is easy.
If you form a plane with these two vectors,
if one points in that direction, the other one in that direction,
I can make a plane of this and the resultant will always be orthogonal,
perpendicular to that plane.
First, I'll point in the R direction with my fingers,
then towards the direction of the P,
and my thumb with the right angle will point towards the positive direction
for the resultant vector.
Okay.
Now, I have a system of time evolution and I want to know what dl dt is.
What is the rate of change of my angular momentum?
So, how do I do that?
How do I take, once again, you'll have to know multivariable calculus.
How do I take this?
Well, it's the same as if I have the f of x and the g of x,
and they multiply with each other,
and I want to take the d dt of this.
How do I do that?
Or, I can say the d dt, you might remember this better,
u and v of the product rule.
So, it's going to be u' v plus u v'
or f prime of g times the g of x plus the f of x times the g prime of x.
So, the product rule, the same applies here.
So, what you're going to have is this dr dt
cross product with p plus we're going to have r cross product with dp dt, dp dt.
Now, I'm holding this under the constraints of this symmetry principle.
So, in my system, all forces are radial.
They point, no matter where I am, I'm pointing towards the same spot,
and there is some symmetry in that situation.
So, what is rate of change of position?
Well, that's velocity times, what is momentum?
Well, that's mass times velocity.
So, this is a cross product of two collinear vectors.
Well, actually, the same vector.
One is just multiplied by a scalar, the inertial mass.
So, it's the same vector.
One is a different magnitude than the other.
And, remember, if I do the cross product,
if I have one vector,
a mathematics cross product, another vector,
let's make it vector r,
and that would be the norm of this vector
times the norm of this vector
times the norm of the other vector
times the sine of the angle between it.
So, that's the same vector,
the angle between the same vector,
just of different sizes, is zero.
The sine of zero is zero.
So, here I have zero.
The zero vector, I should say.
Plus, what do I have on this side?
What do I have on this side?
Well, what is, we just saw in a previous video,
what is the PDT?
The rate of change of momentum is the force.
That's force, isn't it?
Now, if I'm under this radial symmetry,
and I have any position here,
the position vector is there,
but from this spot,
all my forces point towards the same point
from which this position vector came,
so they are what you call collinear vectors.
Collinear, they point in the same line.
They might point in opposite directions,
but they're in the same line.
So, the angle between them is 180 degrees,
or pi radians.
And what is the sign of pi radians,
or the sign of 180 degrees?
It's also zero.
So, this cross product here is also a zero.
So, the rate of change,
d dt,
d dt of L,
equals the zero vector.
It's zero.
And the only way
that you can get zero
for a first derivative
is if that is a constant.
Only the derivative of a constant,
let's put it C,
only the derivative of a constant is zero.
What is the d dx
of x squared?
It's 2x.
But what's the d dt,
or d dx, I should say,
of the constant 3?
That's zero.
Okay?
That means
angular momentum
is a conserved quantity.
Under the symmetry of a radial force,
if I apply a radial force
on a system with
angular momentum,
if I apply a radial force to that,
I will not change.
There will be no time evolution
of this angular momentum.
The angular momentum
under this symmetry
is a conserved quantity.
So, I have a symmetry principle,
and lo and behold,
lo and behold,
what hides
a conserved quantity?
A conserved quantity.
We started with a symmetry principle.
Whenever there is a symmetry principle,
I will find a conserved quantity,
and I have just shown
there is conservation
of angular momentum.
The ice skater is spinning around,
arms outstretched,
goes at a certain angular velocity,
pulls the arms in,
goes a lot faster.
There has to be conservation
of that angular momentum.
Nature does not let it disappear somewhere.
It can't be made,
it can't be destroyed.
So, if there is angular momentum
in that system,
that has to be conserved.
It can't change.
The cross product of this
has to remain some constant
for that system.
So, I have a star,
it spins around,
at the end of its life,
it's a massive star,
becomes a neutron star,
much smaller,
lots of mass still,
it has to go a lot faster.
There is conservation
of angular momentum.
The skater pulls the arms in,
goes around a lot faster
because there is conservation
of angular momentum.
I have stated the symmetry principle
as conserved quantity hides,
and I will show you later on
how from this,
I can now derive
and force a law of nature.
Law of nature.
So, instead of starting there,
where we start usually in physics,
and work our way to this side,
at least to this point,
we're now being proper physicists,
we start here,
and we end there.
