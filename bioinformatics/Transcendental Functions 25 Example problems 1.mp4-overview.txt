The text provides a series of examples and explanations on simplifying expressions involving natural logarithms (ln) and exponentials (e). Here is a summary:

1. **Simplification Examples:**
   - \( e^{\ln(4.8)} \) simplifies to 4.8 because raising Euler's number \( e \) to the power of its natural log returns the original argument.
   - For \( e^{\ln(y^{-2})} \), applying logarithm properties results in \( y^{-2} \) or \( \frac{1}{y^2} \).
   - Similarly, \( e^{\ln(\frac{a}{b})} \) simplifies directly to \( \frac{a}{b} \).

2. **Additional Simplification Examples:**
   - \( 2\ln(\sqrt{e}) \): The square root can be expressed as an exponent (\( \frac{1}{2} \)), leading to \( \ln(e^{1/2}) = \frac{1}{2}\ln(e) = \frac{1}{2} \). So, the expression simplifies to 1.
   - \( \ln(\ln(e^e)) \): The inner logarithm simplifies first: \( \ln(e^e) = e \). Thus, it becomes \( \ln(e) = 1 \).
   - \( \ln(e^{-a^2-b^2}) \): Using exponent properties of logs, this becomes \( -a^2 - b^2 \).

3. **Solving for y:**
   - For \( \ln(y) = 2x + 4 \), by exponentiating both sides, we get \( y = e^{2x+4} \).
   - In the equation \( \ln(y-20) = 5x \), solving similarly gives \( y = e^{5x} + 20 \).
   - For \( \ln(\frac{y-1}{y+1}) = \ln(\sin(x)) \), exponentiating both sides results in \( \frac{y-1}{y+1} = \sin(x) \). Solving for y yields \( y = \frac{\sin(x)+1}{\sin(x)-1} \).

The text demonstrates how properties of logarithms and exponentials are used to simplify expressions and solve equations involving natural logs.
