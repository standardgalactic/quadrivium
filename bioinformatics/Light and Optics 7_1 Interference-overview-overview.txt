The text provides an explanation of light interference and refraction by transitioning from geometric optics (focused on rays) to a wave-based approach. It emphasizes Huygens' Principle, which posits that every point on a wavefront serves as a source of secondary spherical waves propagating at the same speed within a medium. This principle aids in understanding how wavefronts evolve over time and during refraction.

The text further explores refraction, where light enters a medium with a higher refractive index from one with a lower refractive index, causing it to bend towards the normal due to changes in speed. Using geometric reasoning, Snell's Law is derived: \( N_1 \sin(\theta_1) = N_2 \sin(\theta_2) \), explaining how light bends by changing its wavelength and maintaining constant frequency.

Key points include:

1. **Wavefronts and Time Consistency**: Light maintains consistent travel time across different segments as it moves from one point to another at a specific velocity.
   
2. **Wavelength and Velocity Relationship**: When transitioning between media, the wavelength of light changes (from λ₁ to λ₂), but their ratio equals the velocities' ratio in each medium (V₁/V₂).

3. **Snell's Law Derivation**: Demonstrated using trigonometry: \(\sin(\theta_1) / \sin(\theta_2) = N_2 / N_1\). This shows that light bends towards the normal when moving to a denser medium.

4. **Refractive Index and Speed**: The refractive index (N) is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to its speed in a medium, indicating that light's velocity decreases with an increasing refractive index.

5. **Principle of Refraction**: Light slows down and bends towards the normal when entering a denser medium, resulting in shorter wavelengths but constant frequency.

The text also introduces Weyden's principle, which expands on Huygens' Principle by stating that each point on a wavefront acts as an individual source for circular waves (in two dimensions), allowing wave propagation over greater distances within the same time period. This concept underscores how wavefronts can be extended through their spherical nature.
