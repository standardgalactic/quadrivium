The text discusses nesting a `for` loop with an embedded `if` statement to demonstrate specific programming concepts. It provides an example where numbers from 1 to 10 are iterated, checking for divisibility by 3 using the modulus operator (`%`). If a number is divisible by 3 (remainder of zero), the `continue` statement skips printing that number and moves on to the next iteration. This showcases two key concepts:

1. Placing an `if` condition inside a `for` loop.
2. Using the `continue` statement to skip certain iterations when a specified condition is met, in this case, numbers divisible by 3.

In practice:
- Numbers not divisible by 3 are printed because they do not meet the `if` condition, thus avoiding the `continue`.
- Numbers divisible by 3 are skipped due to the activation of the `continue` statement when the `if` condition is true.

The text concludes with a mention that it will explore "comprehension" in a subsequent section.
