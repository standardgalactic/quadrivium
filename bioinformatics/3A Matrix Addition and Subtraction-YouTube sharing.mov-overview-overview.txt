The text outlines key matrix operations: addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication. For addition and subtraction, matrices must have the same dimensions; you add or subtract corresponding elements for two matrices (e.g., A + B, A - B). Scalar multiplication involves multiplying every element of a matrix by a single number. Operations on matrices of different sizes are undefined due to mismatched elements, such as attempting to add a 2x2 matrix with another differently sized matrix. Subtraction is non-commutative; the order matters (B - A â‰  A - B). The text highlights that addition and subtraction require matching dimensions, while scalar multiplication is more straightforward.
