The text explains different methods for approximating the area under a curve using Riemann sums. 

1. **Left Riemann Sums (Lower Sums):** The area is divided into four rectangles where the height of each rectangle is determined by the function value at the left endpoint of each subinterval. However, in this example, the text mistakenly describes using the right endpoints for heights instead. This method tends to underestimate the true area under a curve.

2. **Right Riemann Sums:** Although not explicitly labeled as such in the text, it describes a method where the height of each rectangle is taken at the right side of its base. For instance, the fourth rectangle's height is calculated using \( f(1) = 1 - 1^2 = 0 \). This approach also can lead to underestimation.

3. **Midpoint Sums:** The text briefly mentions midpoint sums as potentially a more accurate method for approximating the true area, but no specific example or detail is provided.

The overarching message is that increasing the number of rectangles (or making \( \Delta x \) smaller) will enhance accuracy in estimating the area under a curve. Ideally, one should use an infinite number of rectangles to achieve precise calculation, as this makes the approximation approach the true value of the integral.
