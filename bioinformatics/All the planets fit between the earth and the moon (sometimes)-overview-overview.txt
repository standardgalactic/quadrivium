Dr. Jean Klopper investigates whether seven planets could fit between Earth and the Moon using Wolfram Language tools. He gathers data on planetary properties like rotation and orbital periods, as well as diameters, using Wolfram Alpha queries and the Entity function. Dr. Klopper visualizes this information with a bar chart to compare the combined diameters of these planets against the average Earth-Moon distance (approximately 385,000 km).

The analysis reveals that at their current sizes, the total diameter of these seven planets is about 380,200 kilometers. This sum fits within the average Earth-Moon distance but not the recorded minimum of 358,494 km. Visualizations using Wolfram Language illustrate that all seven planets could fit between Earth and Moon on average.

The conclusion demonstrates how computational tools can effectively explore astronomical concepts visually. Additionally, there is a nod to environmental passion, emphasizing commitment towards sustainability and conservation efforts as crucial for preserving our planet's ecosystems for future generations.
