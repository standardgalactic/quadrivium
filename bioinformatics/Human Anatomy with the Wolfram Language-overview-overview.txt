The text introduces a course on human anatomy led by Jean Klopper at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. Klopper, known for his medical education efforts through over 1,400 YouTube lectures and Coursera courses, emphasizes the importance of surgical research and education. In this new course, he aims to combine anatomical study with computational skills using the Wolfram language, particularly focusing on its rich notebook format that integrates documentation with computation seamlessly.

Klopper's course will teach students how to use coding in the Wilfam (Wolfram) language for creating anatomical representations and applying it to biostatistics. This includes generating data sets using normal distribution functions and comparing groups through statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test and t-tests, leveraging Mathematica’s user-friendly interface.

The text also highlights Wolfram Alpha's capabilities in providing detailed information through simple queries on topics such as anatomy, nutrition, and population statistics. Additionally, it describes using Mathematica for visualizing anatomical structures with functions like `AnatomyPlot3D`, which allows the creation of interactive 3D models by specifying elements like color and structure attributes.

Overall, Klopper’s course aims to equip students with both anatomical insights and computational skills, enhancing their understanding through technology-driven methods. The text underscores Mathematica as a valuable tool for medical professionals in education and practice.
