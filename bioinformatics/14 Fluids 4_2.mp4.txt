There is an important concept that I just want to add to Archimedes' principle.
And that pertains to when you are solving problems.
Remember these two facts.
The magnitude of the buoyant force is not dependent on the density of the fluid.
And secondly the volume of the fluid displaced decreases as the density of the fluid increases.
Remember the mass of the displaced fluid remains the same as the mass of the object.
So the denser the fluid the less amount of it needs to be displaced to equal that mass of the object.
So remember these two facts.
