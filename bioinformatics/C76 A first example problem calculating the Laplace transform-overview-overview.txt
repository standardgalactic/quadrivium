The text outlines the process of finding the Laplace transform of the function \( f(t) = t \). It begins by defining the Laplace transform as an improper integral:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-st} \cdot t \, dt
\]

To solve this, integration by parts is used with \( u = t \), \( dv = e^{-st} \, dt \), which gives \( du = dt \) and \( v = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \). Applying the integration by parts formula:

\[
uv - \int v \, du
\]

results in:

\[
\left[-\frac{t}{s} e^{-st}\right]_0^\infty + \int \frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \, dt
\]

The boundary term \( \left[-\frac{t}{s} e^{-st}\right]_0^\infty \) evaluates to 0 as \( t \to \infty \), since \( t e^{-st} \to 0 \). The remaining integral is:

\[
\int \frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \, dt
\]

This integral is the Laplace transform of 1, which equals \( \frac{1}{s} \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{s^2}
\]

Thus, the Laplace transform of \( t \) is \( \frac{1}{s^2} \). The text also highlights a pattern where the Laplace transform of \( t^n \) is given by \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \), consistent with examples for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \).
