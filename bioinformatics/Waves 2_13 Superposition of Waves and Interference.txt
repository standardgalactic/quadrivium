Now we're going to start looking at interference.
And to do that we first have to look at the principle of superposition of waves.
Superposition.
And this is really basic school stuff.
You know if two waves come toward each other
and that's the one wave and that's the other wave coming when they get together
and if this is delta y
or y max, the displacement
when they do come together it's just going to be additive. In other words
the displacements
are just added to each other. So this is a simple principle of
superposition of waves. And we know if
two of them combine they're just going to have a
doubling of y max.
And if they are out of phase
exactly
half a wave length
out of phase then they're going to completely
cancel out because if that says
20 positive 4 that's going to be
negative 4 so the result is going to be
a straight line.
Important to remember is that
these don't
this is only about
displacement in the y direction and
transverse velocity. This has nothing to do with the
longitudinal velocity of that wave
as they interfere with each other
whether there's full interference
here either
adding or cancelling out like that
or that there's partial interference
the wave speed
this is going to be the same. Remember
that velocity is constant
and is given as
as
tension divided by the linear density
and
not by the frequency in the wavelength
the product of the frequency in the wavelength
is also going to give you a constant
and one goes up, the other one goes down
one goes down, the other one goes up
but the speed of those waves
is not going to change
so that's the principle of superposition
now if we do
look at interference
as I said if we express a wave
as y, the displacement
in the y direction
as a function of both x and t
and we have y1
and we have y2
also in x and t
that is going to give us some y total
and let's say that we send these two waves
down our medium
which is our rope
and we're just going to set them
a certain phase angle apart
so we're going to have that y1
of x and t
is going to be some y maximum
times the sine of kx
minus omega t
and
the second wave
so it's displacement
let's give it the same y maximum
we're going to give it the same angular wave number
we're going to give it the same frequency
in other words angular velocity t
but we're just going to
the only difference between those two
is going to be the phase angle
we're just going to set one
some radians apart
from the other one
some radians apart
from the other one
and i'm just looking at my cheat board
let's add these two together
so we're going to go for y total
y total which we have here
which is just y1 plus y2
so we're going to have this plus that
so i can take out y
max as a common denominator
and i'm going to be left with
the sine of kx minus omega t
plus the sine of kx minus omega t plus phi
so what i have in actual fact here
what i do have
let's make some space
so what we do have here
if that if i call kx minus omega t alpha
and beta what i have here
is the sine of alpha
and the sine of beta
so that's the addition
of the sine values of two different
ways from technology
you might remember i don't want to make a mistake
the other is two times the sine
of a half
alpha plus beta
times the cosine of a half
times alpha minus beta
that's the trigonometric identity
that you should know
so if i do that
to this equation here
let's make some more space
if i do that to this equation here
i'm going to be left with y total
it's going to equal
y max still
so this is alpha
this is beta
so i'm going to be left with two times
the sine of half
times this
plus that
so that's going to be two times kx
minus two times
omega t plus phi
and if i just multiply
that whole thing out by a half
i'm going to be left with kx
minus omega t
plus a half phi
plus a half phi
and then the cosine
of a half
times this one minus this one
times this one
minus this one
so this one kx minus kx is nothing
minus omega t minus minus omega t
that's nothing
and then we're going to have negative then a half
negative a half
times phi
times phi
i can bring
two out
and remember
the cosine of negative an angle
equals the cosine of that angle
so now we're going to have
two times y max
two times y max
times the cosine
of half of phi
cosine of a half
phi
the sine of
kx minus omega t
minus omega t
plus half
phi
and that is my equation that i'm interested in
we've got y total
y total
so if i send two waves along
at the same y maximum
in the same frequency
and the same wavelength
same frequency
same wavelength
and i just set them apart
at a certain phase angle
phi
i'm going to get
some interference pattern
and the interference pattern
i'm going to get
my y displacement
is going to be
this equation
so how does that differ
say for instance
from my original two equations
that i had
that just
had
the phase angle difference
because as i send
the two along
there's going to be interference
and i'm going to get
a resultant sine curve
and
it differs
just by
the resultant new
waves that i'm going to see
and i'm going to see
the two individual ones
that i sent along
it's just going to
differ by
a half
phi
and
the y max
is actually just going to be
y max
is just going to be
this
two times the little
y max
times the cosine of
half of phi
now interestingly enough
look at it
if i let
the phase angle between them
be zero
if this is zero
i'm just left with the
sine of
h minus omega t
and the cosine
cosine of
half times zero is zero
cosine of zero is one
so i'm just left with two
times y max
times the sine of
so if i send two
identical ones
going at the same time
the only difference
that i'm going to see
is i'm going to have
two times
i'm going to have
two times y max
because this is one
and then is zero
so the only difference
is going to be
this is quite satisfying
then to see
to see what will happen
or if i let them
half a wavelength
remember half a wavelength
is pi
remember
the sine repeats
the two pi radians
so if i let them be
pi radians
or half a wavelength
apart from each
away from each other
which means i'm going to
have this
and i'm going to have
this
as that one carries on
and that one carries on
in other words
i'm going to have the cosine
of
i'm going to have here
the cosine of
of
i said if i let them
pi
half
i've just got to think
about that
and anyway
what you're going to end up
with is
is this
where they cancel out
completely
and that's going to be
two
y makes
times zero
times zero
which is then going to
give you exactly this
if they are
if they are
if they are
half a wavelength
aside
i'm just thinking of it
obviously if i let them be
a half a wavelength
a half a wavelength
a half a wavelength
remember this is going to
equal pi
this is going to
equal pi
so if
if i say
if i let this be pi
it's pi over two
and the question of pi over two
is of course is zero
and then we get this
cancellation
the interference being a complete cancellation
the cancellation
