The text explains how trigonometric substitution can be used in integration, particularly when dealing with integrals containing square roots. It introduces three main cases for substitution based on the form inside the square root:

1. **For \(\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\):** Use \(x = a\sin\theta\) or \(x = a\cos\theta\).
2. **For \(\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}\):** Use \(x = a\tan\theta\), which results in \(\sec\theta\).
3. **For \(\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}\):** Use \(x = a\sec\theta\), resulting in \(a\tan\theta\).

The text provides an example to illustrate the process:

- Given the integral \(\int \frac{1}{x^2\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \, dx\), identify the form as \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\).
- Substitute \(x = \tan\theta\), leading to \(dx = \sec^2\theta \, d\theta\) and \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \sec\theta\).
- Transform the integral into \(\int \frac{\sec^2\theta}{\tan^2\theta \cdot \sec\theta} \, d\theta = \int \frac{\sec\theta}{\tan^2\theta} \, d\theta\).
- Simplify using trigonometric identities: \(\sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}\) and \(\tan^2\theta = \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos^2\theta}\), leading to \(\int \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^2\theta} \, d\theta\).
- Use \(u\)-substitution with \(u = \sin\theta\), \(du = \cos\theta \, d\theta\), resulting in \(-\frac{1}{u} + C = -\frac{1}{\sin\theta} + C\).

Finally, to revert back to the original variable \(x\), use a right triangle representation:

- With \(x = \tan\theta\), construct a right triangle where the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1.
- The hypotenuse becomes \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\).
- Thus, \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\).

The solution to the integral in terms of \(x\) is \(-\frac{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}{x} + C\).

The text describes a process involving trigonometric substitution to solve an integral or equation. It starts by considering \(1^2 + x^2\) and relates it to the Pythagorean theorem, focusing on finding the sine of an angle \(\theta\). The sine is expressed as \(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\).

The original problem involves transforming an expression \(-\frac{1}{\sin(\theta) + c}\), substituting for \(\sin(\theta)\) to obtain:

\[
-\frac{\sqrt{1+x^2}}{x + c}
\]

This transformation is part of what's known as "reversal of trigonometric substitution."

Additionally, the text presents an alternative approach by setting \(\tan(\theta) = x\), which implies \(\theta = \arctan(x)\). Substituting this into the original problem gives:

\[
-\frac{1}{\sin(\arctan(x)) + c}
\]

Both methods yield equivalent expressions involving \(x\), providing solutions to the initial problem.
