This text outlines a Julia programming project focused on introductory medical statistics. The project involves setting up and analyzing a basic medical research study from start to finish using Julia, specifically through juliabox.org. Participants can follow along or access resources on GitHub if they prefer not to create everything themselves.

The key steps in the project include:

1. Formulating a research question.
2. Conducting a literature search related to that question.
3. Deciding on the type of study and necessary variables for answering the research question.
4. Establishing null and alternate hypotheses based on these variables.
5. Discussing protocol development and obtaining ethics approval.
6. Creating a data collection tool that ensures patient anonymity.
7. Importing the dataset into Julia for analysis.

The initial focus will be on developing a suitable research question, which will guide subsequent steps in the project.

The text outlines a project focused on introductory medical statistics using Julia, specifically through juliabox.org. The project involves setting up and analyzing a basic medical research study from inception to completion. Key steps include:

1. Formulating a research question.
2. Conducting a literature search to review existing publications related to the question.
3. Deciding on the type of study and identifying necessary variables for answering the research question.
4. Setting null and alternative hypotheses based on those variables.
5. Developing a protocol and obtaining ethics approval.
6. Creating a data collection tool that ensures patient anonymity.
7. Importing the dataset into Julia for analysis.

The project files are available on GitHub for reference, allowing users to follow along without having to create everything from scratch. The next section will focus on defining the research question.
