The text describes a method for calculating a vector perpendicular to a given surface \( Z = G(X, Y) \) in three-dimensional space. The approach involves defining a new function \( \text{G}(X, Y, Z) = Z - G(X, Y) \), where the contour of this function at zero corresponds back to the original surface equation \( Z = G(X, Y) \). This construction is done in four-dimensional space, and by taking its gradient (using the del operator or nabla), we obtain a vector that is perpendicular to the original surface at every point.

The key insight here is using the contour of this new function to find the normal vector. The process concludes with converting this perpendicular vector into a unit vector by dividing it by its norm, resulting in a normalized vector that points directly away from the surface everywhere. This method provides an elegant way to determine normals for any given point on the surface within three-dimensional space.

The text describes a method for calculating a vector perpendicular to a given surface at any point on it. The surface is defined by \( Z = G(X, Y) \), where \( X \) and \( Y \) lie in the XY plane. To find the perpendicular vector, the author constructs a new function, \( G_{\text{capital}}(X, Y, Z) = Z - G(X, Y) \), which is defined in three-dimensional space.

By considering the contour of this new function at zero (\( G_{\text{capital}} = 0 \)), we return to the original surface equation \( Z = G(X, Y) \). The gradient (denoted by the nabla symbol) of the new function gives a vector that is perpendicular to its contour at zero. This vector is also perpendicular to the original surface in three-dimensional space.

To convert this perpendicular vector into a unit vector, each component of the vector is divided by its norm (or length), resulting in a unit vector pointing in the direction perpendicular to the original surface. This approach provides an elegant solution for determining the normal vector at any point on the surface.
