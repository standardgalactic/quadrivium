The text describes a method for calculating a vector perpendicular to a given surface \( Z = G(X, Y) \) in three-dimensional space. The approach involves defining a new function \( \text{G}(X, Y, Z) = Z - G(X, Y) \), where the contour of this function at zero corresponds back to the original surface equation \( Z = G(X, Y) \). This construction is done in four-dimensional space, and by taking its gradient (using the del operator or nabla), we obtain a vector that is perpendicular to the original surface at every point.

The key insight here is using the contour of this new function to find the normal vector. The process concludes with converting this perpendicular vector into a unit vector by dividing it by its norm, resulting in a normalized vector that points directly away from the surface everywhere. This method provides an elegant way to determine normals for any given point on the surface within three-dimensional space.
