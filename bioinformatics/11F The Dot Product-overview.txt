The text describes how to calculate the angle between a diagonal of a cube and one of its sides, specifically using vectors. The cube is considered with unit side lengths aligned along the x, y, and z axes, making each axis vector a unit vector: \( \mathbf{i} = (1, 0, 0) \), \( \mathbf{j} = (0, 1, 0) \), and \( \mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1) \).

The diagonal vector from one corner of the cube to the opposite corner is \( \mathbf{d} = (1, 1, 1) \). The task is to find the angle between this diagonal vector \( \mathbf{d} \) and the z-axis vector \( \mathbf{k} \).

Using the dot product formula, the cosine of the angle \( \theta \) between two vectors \( \mathbf{a} \) and \( \mathbf{b} \) is given by:

\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|}
\]

For vectors \( \mathbf{d} \) and \( \mathbf{k} \):

- The dot product \( \mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{k} = 1 \times 0 + 1 \times 0 + 1 \times 1 = 1 \).
- The magnitude of \( \mathbf{d} \) is \( \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{3} \).
- The magnitude of \( \mathbf{k} \) is \( \sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = 1 \).

Thus, the cosine of the angle is:

\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} \times 1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Therefore, the angle \( \theta \) is:

\[
\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
\]

The text describes how to calculate the angle, \(\theta\), between a diagonal and any one of the sides of a cube. This is done using vectors and involves several steps:

1. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The formula for \(\theta\) is derived using the dot product and magnitudes of vectors representing the side and diagonal of the cube.
   - For unit length (side = 1), it simplifies to finding \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\).
   - This gives \(\theta = \text{arc cosine}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\).

2. **Generalization:**
   - The calculation is generalized for a cube with side length \(p\), not just 1.
   - The vectors representing the sides are scaled by \(p\), but the formula remains \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) because the \(p\) terms cancel out.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The angle between a diagonal and any side of a cube is independent of the actual length of the sides, as long as they are equal (i.e., it's a cube).
   - This result can be verified using vector mathematics, where \(\theta\) is defined by the dot product of vectors \(u\) and \(v\), constrained between 0 and \(\pi\).

The text emphasizes that understanding these principles allows for calculating angles in geometric shapes like cubes, regardless of their specific dimensions.

The text explains how to determine the angle between two vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \). It states that when calculating angles, we use values between 0 and 180 degrees, avoiding negative angles or those greater than 180 degrees.

1. **Dot Product Basics**: 
   - The dot product of a vector with itself (\( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} \)) is equal to the square of its norm (magnitude), because the angle between a vector and itself is zero, making \( \cos(0) = 1 \).

2. **Angle Determination**:
   - If \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} > 0 \), the angle (\(\theta\)) between them is acute (less than 90 degrees or \( \pi/2 \)).
   - If \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} < 0 \), the angle is obtuse (between 90 and 180 degrees).
   - If \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \), the vectors are perpendicular, forming a right angle (\( \theta = 90^\circ \)).

The text emphasizes remembering these relationships to quickly determine whether angles between vectors are acute, obtuse, or right based on their dot product.
