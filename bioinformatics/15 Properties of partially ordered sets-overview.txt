The text discusses the conditions under which a relation partially orders a set, specifically when it is not a total order. For a relation \( R \) to partially order a set, it must satisfy three properties: reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity.

- **Reflexivity**: Every element is related to itself.
- **Anti-symmetry**: If an element \( a \) is related to another element \( b \), and vice versa (\( aRb \) and \( bRa \)), then \( a \) must equal \( b \).
- **Transitivity**: If one element relates to a second, which in turn relates to a third (\( aRb \) and \( bRc \)), then the first relates directly to the third (\( aRc \)).

A partial order does not necessarily form a total order because not every pair of elements needs to be comparable. The text provides an example with the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 12\}\) and the relation "divides," illustrating how subsets can maintain a partial order without being totally ordered. For instance, in the subset \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), not all elements are comparable (e.g., 2 does not divide 3), while in the subset \(\{1, 2, 4\}\), every element is comparable, making it a total order.

The text discusses conditions under which a relation partially orders a set without necessarily resulting in a total order. A relation \( R \) on a set partially orders it if \( R \) is reflexive (every element relates to itself), anti-symmetric (if two elements are related both ways, they must be equal), and transitive (if one element relates to a second and the second relates to a third, then the first relates to the third).

A total order requires an additional property: comparability among all pairs of elements. The text illustrates this with examples using divisibility as the relation on sets containing numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12. It shows that while some subsets may form a partial order (e.g., {1, 2, 3}), others can be totally ordered (e.g., {1, 2, 4} under divisibility), but the presence of a partial order in a set guarantees at least a partial order for all its subsets.
