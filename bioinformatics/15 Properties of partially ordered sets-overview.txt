The text discusses the conditions under which a relation partially orders a set, specifically when it is not a total order. For a relation \( R \) to partially order a set, it must satisfy three properties: reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity.

- **Reflexivity**: Every element is related to itself.
- **Anti-symmetry**: If an element \( a \) is related to another element \( b \), and vice versa (\( aRb \) and \( bRa \)), then \( a \) must equal \( b \).
- **Transitivity**: If one element relates to a second, which in turn relates to a third (\( aRb \) and \( bRc \)), then the first relates directly to the third (\( aRc \)).

A partial order does not necessarily form a total order because not every pair of elements needs to be comparable. The text provides an example with the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 12\}\) and the relation "divides," illustrating how subsets can maintain a partial order without being totally ordered. For instance, in the subset \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), not all elements are comparable (e.g., 2 does not divide 3), while in the subset \(\{1, 2, 4\}\), every element is comparable, making it a total order.
