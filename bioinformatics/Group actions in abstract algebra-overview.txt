Certainly! Let's break down the concept of a group acting on a set, focusing on the properties that define such an action.

### Group Action Basics

1. **Group and Set**: 
   - A group \( G \) consists of elements with a binary operation (like multiplication or addition) satisfying closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.
   - A set \( A \) is just a collection of distinct objects.

2. **Action**:
   - A group \( G \) acts on a set \( A \) if there's a function \( \sigma: G \times A \to A \) satisfying two properties:
     1. **Identity**: For every element \( a \in A \), the identity element \( e \) of \( G \) satisfies \( \sigma(e, a) = a \).
     2. **Compatibility**: For all \( g_1, g_2 \in G \) and \( a \in A \), \( \sigma(g_1, \sigma(g_2, a)) = \sigma(g_1g_2, a) \).

### Explanation

- **Identity Property**: This ensures that the identity element of the group acts as a "do nothing" operation on any element of the set. It's like multiplying by 1 in arithmetic.

- **Compatibility Property**: This ensures that performing two group operations consecutively is the same as performing their combined operation once. It mirrors how you can rearrange parentheses in multiplication without changing the result (associativity).

### Bijection and Permutations

- The function \( \sigma(g, a) \) essentially permutes elements of \( A \). For each \( g \in G \), there's a corresponding permutation of \( A \).
  
- **Faithful Action**: If different group elements always result in different permutations (i.e., the map from \( G \) to the set of permutations is injective), the action is faithful. This means you can distinguish all elements of \( G \) by how they permute \( A \).

### Cayley's Theorem

- **Cayley’s Theorem**: Every group \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on \( G \). This theorem essentially shows that any abstract group can be represented concretely as permutations.

### Visualizing Group Actions

- Imagine each element of \( G \) shuffling or rearranging elements of \( A \) in some way. The action is like a dance where each step (group element) leads to a specific configuration of dancers (elements of the set).

### Non-Faithful Actions

- In non-faithful actions, different group elements might lead to the same permutation of the set. This means some information about the group's structure is "lost" in how it acts on the set.

By understanding these concepts, you can see how group theory connects abstract algebraic structures with concrete operations like permutations.

The text describes an example illustrating a group action, specifically using two permutations, \(\tau_1\) and \(\sigma\), acting on a set. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: Define two permutations: 
   - \(\tau_1 = (1 \ 2)\) which swaps 1 and 2.
   - \(\sigma = (1 \ 2 \ 3)\) which cycles 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 back to 1.

2. **Action on an Element**: 
   - Consider the element \(a = 2\).
   - Compute \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma(2)\):
     - First apply \(\sigma\) to 2: \(\sigma(2) = 3\).
     - Then apply \(\tau_1\) to 3: \(\tau_1(3) = 3\) (since 3 is unchanged by \(\tau_1\)).
   - Result: \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma(2) = 3\).

3. **Composition of Permutations**:
   - Determine the composition \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma\):
     - Apply \(\sigma\) first, then \(\tau_1\).
     - For 1: \(\sigma(1) = 2\), then \(\tau_1(2) = 1\).
     - For 2: \(\sigma(2) = 3\), then \(\tau_1(3) = 3\).
     - For 3: \(\sigma(3) = 1\), then \(\tau_1(1) = 2\).
   - Resulting permutation: \((1 \ 1)(2 \ 3)\) or simply \((2 \ 3)\).

4. **Verification**:
   - Verify that the composition \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma\) is equivalent to \(\tau_3 = (2 \ 3)\).
   - Check: \(\tau_3(2) = 3\), which matches \((\tau_1 \circ \sigma)(2) = 3\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The property of group actions holds, demonstrating that the composition of permutations results in another permutation.
   - This example illustrates a group action on a set, showing how elements of a group can act as permutations of a set.

The text emphasizes understanding the connection between group elements and their action as permutations, highlighting this as an instance of a faithful group action.

Certainly! Let’s delve into the concept of group actions, particularly focusing on understanding how a group acts on a set through permutations. This will help clarify how properties like bijections and faithful representations are involved.

### Group Actions

A **group action** is a way to describe how elements of a group \( G \) can interact with or "act" on elements in a set \( A \). Formally, a group action of \( G \) on \( A \) is defined as a function:

\[ \cdot : G \times A \to A \]

such that for all \( g, h \in G \) and \( a \in A \):

1. **Identity Property**: The identity element \( e \) of the group acts as the identity on \( A \):
   \[
   e \cdot a = a
   \]
2. **Compatibility Property**: The action respects the group operation:
   \[
   (g \cdot h) \cdot a = g \cdot (h \cdot a)
   \]

### Permutations and Bijections

When we say that \( G \) acts on \( A \), each element \( g \in G \) induces a permutation of the set \( A \). This means there is a bijection from \( A \) to itself, defined by:

\[ \sigma_g : A \to A, \quad \text{where} \quad \sigma_g(a) = g \cdot a \]

The function \( \sigma_g \) is a permutation of the set \( A \). For \( G \) acting faithfully on \( A \), each non-identity element of \( G \) must induce a different permutation. This ensures that:

\[ \forall g, h \in G, \quad g \neq h \Rightarrow \sigma_g \neq \sigma_h \]

### Cayley's Theorem

Cayley’s theorem states that every group \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on \( G \). This can be seen through the group action where each element acts by left multiplication:

\[ g \cdot h = gh \quad \text{for} \quad h \in G \]

This creates a homomorphism from \( G \) into the permutation group of \( G \), showing that every group is representable as permutations.

### Example with Properties

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate these concepts:

- **Group**: Let \( G = \{e, g\} \) where \( e \) is the identity and \( g^2 = e \).
- **Set**: Let \( A = \{a, b\} \).

Define an action of \( G \) on \( A \):

- \( e \cdot a = a \), \( e \cdot b = b \)
- \( g \cdot a = b \), \( g \cdot b = a \)

This defines permutations:

- \( \sigma_e: \{a, b\} \to \{a, b\} \) is the identity permutation.
- \( \sigma_g: \{a, b\} \to \{b, a\} \) swaps \( a \) and \( b \).

Check properties:

1. **Identity**: \( e \cdot (g \cdot a) = g \cdot a = b \) and \( (e \cdot g) \cdot a = g \cdot a = b \).
2. **Compatibility**: \( g \cdot (g \cdot a) = g \cdot b = a \) and \( (g \cdot g) \cdot a = e \cdot a = a \).

This shows the group action satisfies both properties, demonstrating how elements of \( G \) permute the set \( A \).

### Conclusion

Understanding group actions as permutations helps visualize how groups can systematically interact with sets. The bijection aspect ensures each group element corresponds uniquely to a permutation, especially in faithful actions where no two different elements induce the same permutation on the set. This framework is foundational for exploring deeper topics like representation theory and symmetry in mathematics.

The text describes an example of a group action on a set, using permutations. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: Two permutations are defined:
   - \(\tau_1\) swaps 1 and 2, leaving 3 unchanged.
   - \(\sigma\) cycles 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 back to 1.

2. **Operation**:
   - The action of \(\tau_1\) on the result of \(\sigma(2)\) is considered.
   - Since \(\sigma(2) = 3\), we find \(\tau_1(3) = 3\).

3. **Composition**:
   - The composition \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma\) is calculated by applying \(\sigma\) first, then \(\tau_1\).
   - For each element: 
     - \(1 \to 2\) (via \(\sigma\)), then \(2 \to 1\) (via \(\tau_1\)), resulting in \(1 \to 1\).
     - \(2 \to 3\) (via \(\sigma\)), and \(3 \to 3\) (via \(\tau_1\)), resulting in \(2 \to 3\).
     - \(3 \to 1\) (via \(\sigma\)), then \(1 \to 2\) (via \(\tau_1\)), resulting in \(3 \to 2\).

4. **Result**:
   - The composition \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma\) results in the permutation \((1)(2 \to 3 \to 1)\), which is equivalent to \(\tau_3\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - This demonstrates a group action, as the property of associativity and identity holds.
   - The example illustrates how permutations can act on sets, forming a faithful group action.

This explanation highlights the connection between group elements (permutations) and their actions on sets, showcasing a fundamental concept in abstract algebra.
