Certainly! Let's break down the concept of a group acting on a set, focusing on the properties that define such an action.

### Group Action Basics

1. **Group and Set**: 
   - A group \( G \) consists of elements with a binary operation (like multiplication or addition) satisfying closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.
   - A set \( A \) is just a collection of distinct objects.

2. **Action**:
   - A group \( G \) acts on a set \( A \) if there's a function \( \sigma: G \times A \to A \) satisfying two properties:
     1. **Identity**: For every element \( a \in A \), the identity element \( e \) of \( G \) satisfies \( \sigma(e, a) = a \).
     2. **Compatibility**: For all \( g_1, g_2 \in G \) and \( a \in A \), \( \sigma(g_1, \sigma(g_2, a)) = \sigma(g_1g_2, a) \).

### Explanation

- **Identity Property**: This ensures that the identity element of the group acts as a "do nothing" operation on any element of the set. It's like multiplying by 1 in arithmetic.

- **Compatibility Property**: This ensures that performing two group operations consecutively is the same as performing their combined operation once. It mirrors how you can rearrange parentheses in multiplication without changing the result (associativity).

### Bijection and Permutations

- The function \( \sigma(g, a) \) essentially permutes elements of \( A \). For each \( g \in G \), there's a corresponding permutation of \( A \).
  
- **Faithful Action**: If different group elements always result in different permutations (i.e., the map from \( G \) to the set of permutations is injective), the action is faithful. This means you can distinguish all elements of \( G \) by how they permute \( A \).

### Cayley's Theorem

- **Cayleyâ€™s Theorem**: Every group \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on \( G \). This theorem essentially shows that any abstract group can be represented concretely as permutations.

### Visualizing Group Actions

- Imagine each element of \( G \) shuffling or rearranging elements of \( A \) in some way. The action is like a dance where each step (group element) leads to a specific configuration of dancers (elements of the set).

### Non-Faithful Actions

- In non-faithful actions, different group elements might lead to the same permutation of the set. This means some information about the group's structure is "lost" in how it acts on the set.

By understanding these concepts, you can see how group theory connects abstract algebraic structures with concrete operations like permutations.

The text describes an example illustrating a group action, specifically using two permutations, \(\tau_1\) and \(\sigma\), acting on a set. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: Define two permutations: 
   - \(\tau_1 = (1 \ 2)\) which swaps 1 and 2.
   - \(\sigma = (1 \ 2 \ 3)\) which cycles 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 back to 1.

2. **Action on an Element**: 
   - Consider the element \(a = 2\).
   - Compute \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma(2)\):
     - First apply \(\sigma\) to 2: \(\sigma(2) = 3\).
     - Then apply \(\tau_1\) to 3: \(\tau_1(3) = 3\) (since 3 is unchanged by \(\tau_1\)).
   - Result: \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma(2) = 3\).

3. **Composition of Permutations**:
   - Determine the composition \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma\):
     - Apply \(\sigma\) first, then \(\tau_1\).
     - For 1: \(\sigma(1) = 2\), then \(\tau_1(2) = 1\).
     - For 2: \(\sigma(2) = 3\), then \(\tau_1(3) = 3\).
     - For 3: \(\sigma(3) = 1\), then \(\tau_1(1) = 2\).
   - Resulting permutation: \((1 \ 1)(2 \ 3)\) or simply \((2 \ 3)\).

4. **Verification**:
   - Verify that the composition \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma\) is equivalent to \(\tau_3 = (2 \ 3)\).
   - Check: \(\tau_3(2) = 3\), which matches \((\tau_1 \circ \sigma)(2) = 3\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The property of group actions holds, demonstrating that the composition of permutations results in another permutation.
   - This example illustrates a group action on a set, showing how elements of a group can act as permutations of a set.

The text emphasizes understanding the connection between group elements and their action as permutations, highlighting this as an instance of a faithful group action.
