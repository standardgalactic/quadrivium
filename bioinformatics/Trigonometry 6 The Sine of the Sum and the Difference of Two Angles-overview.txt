The text explores the relationships between the sine function and the addition or subtraction of two angles using a scalene triangle ABC. In this setup:

1. **Triangle and Line Setup**: Triangle ABC has sides AB and AC, with none of its angles being 90 degrees. A perpendicular line from angle C intersects side AC at point P, dividing it into segments AP (length X) and PC (length C-X).

2. **Angle Division**: The line CP divides angle C into two smaller angles, alpha and beta.

3. **Sine and Cosine Relationships**:
   - Using the sine rule in triangle ABC: \(\frac{\sin C}{C} = \frac{\sin A}{A} = \frac{\sin B}{B}\).
   - In triangles CAP and CBP, relationships are established using \(\sin\) and \(\cos\):
     - \(\sin A = \frac{H}{B}\), \(\cos \alpha = \frac{H}{B}\) (triangle CAP).
     - \(\sin B = \frac{H}{A}\), \(\cos \beta = \frac{H}{A}\) (triangle CBP).

4. **Sine Addition Identity**:
   - Deriving the sine of alpha plus beta: 
     \[
     \sin(\alpha + \beta) = X \cdot \frac{\cos \beta}{B} + (C-X) \cdot \frac{\sin \alpha}{A}
     \]
   - Simplified to the identity:
     \[
     \sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cdot \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cdot \cos \alpha
     \]

5. **Sine Double Angle Identity**:
   - By setting alpha equal to beta, derive:
     \[
     \sin(2\alpha) = 2 \cdot \sin \alpha \cdot \cos \alpha
     \]

6. **Even and Odd Function Properties**:
   - Sine is an odd function: \(\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)\).
   - Cosine is an even function: \(\cos(-x) = \cos(x)\).

7. **Sine Subtraction Identity**:
   - Using the properties of sine and cosine, derive:
     \[
     \sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cdot \cos \beta - \sin \beta \cdot \cos \alpha
     \]

The text concludes by mentioning that future discussions will cover the cosine identities for the sum and difference of two angles.
