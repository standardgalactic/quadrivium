so this channel has been quiet for quite some time number one right outside my office there's
construction work and no matter what time i come in in the morning or what time i leave in the
evening they are hammering away it is just absolute chaos number two is a bit more important
a research group is really concentrating on one thing and really putting so much effort into it
and that is machine learning so much so that i'm in one of my favorite cities in the world i could
really live here no problem whatsoever i'm in amsterdam and the reason why i'm in amsterdam
is to attend a conference medical imaging deep learning it's going to be a fantastic conference
i think i'm really looking forward to it before it starts though come and have a look at the hotel i'm
singing
Thank you.
Thank you.
