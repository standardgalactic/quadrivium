The text explains how to solve a problem involving repeated eigenvalues, specifically focusing on the case where an eigenvalue has multiplicity 2. It begins by defining multiplicity and setting up the equation for \(x_m\) when dealing with repeated eigenvalues.

For a matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) that is 2x2, the text describes how to find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation of \(\mathbf{A} - \lambda\mathbf{I}\). Given the specific matrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & -18 \\
2 & -9
\end{bmatrix},
\]

the characteristic polynomial is derived as \((3-\lambda)(-9-\lambda) + 36 = 0\), simplifying to \(\lambda^2 + 6\lambda + 9 = 0\). This factors into \((\lambda + 3)^2 = 0\), indicating a repeated eigenvalue of \(\lambda = -3\) with multiplicity 2.

Next, the text describes finding eigenvectors and generalized solutions. For the eigenvalue \(-3\), an eigenvector is found by solving:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
6 & -18 \\
2 & -6
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
k_1 \\
k_2
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to \(3k_1 - 9k_2 = 0\) or \(k_1 = 3, k_2 = 1\), giving the eigenvector \(\mathbf{k} = [3, 1]\).

Since only one linearly independent eigenvector is found for a multiplicity of 2, the text uses the generalized eigenvector approach. Solving:

\[
(\mathbf{A} + 3\mathbf{I})\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{k},
\]

yields the generalized eigenvector \(\mathbf{p} = [0.5, 0]\).

The general solution to the system is then expressed as a combination of solutions:

\[
\mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} e^{-3t} + c_2 \left( t 
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} \right) e^{-3t},
\]

where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants determined by initial conditions. This solution reflects both the eigenvector and generalized eigenvector contributions due to the repeated eigenvalue.

The text discusses solving a differential equation problem involving repeated eigenvalues and their multiplicities. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Multiplicity**: The concept of multiplicity is introduced, particularly for repeated real eigenvalues. In this context, an eigenvalue with multiplicity 2 means it appears twice in the characteristic equation.

2. **Problem Setup**: A matrix \( A \) is given as:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -18 \\ 2 & -9 \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   The task involves finding eigenvalues by setting up and solving the determinant of \( (A - \lambda I) = 0 \).

3. **Eigenvalue Calculation**: The characteristic equation derived is:
   \[
   (\lambda + 3)^2 = 0
   \]
   This results in a repeated eigenvalue of \(\lambda = -3\) with multiplicity 2.

4. **Eigenvector and General Solution**:
   - For the eigenvalue \(\lambda = -3\), an eigenvector \( k \) is found by solving:
     \[
     (A + 3I)k = 0
     \]
   - Only one linearly independent eigenvector can be obtained, indicating a need for generalized solutions.

5. **Generalized Eigenvector**:
   - To find the generalized eigenvector \( p \), solve:
     \[
     (A + 3I)p = k
     \]
   - This leads to a second solution involving both an eigenvector and a generalized eigenvector.

6. **General Solution**: The general solution for the system is expressed as:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{-3t} + c_2 \left( t \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \right) e^{-3t}
   \]
   where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants determined by initial conditions.

This approach highlights how to handle differential equations with repeated eigenvalues using both eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors to form a complete solution set.
