The text explains how to solve a problem involving repeated eigenvalues, specifically focusing on the case where an eigenvalue has multiplicity 2. It begins by defining multiplicity and setting up the equation for \(x_m\) when dealing with repeated eigenvalues.

For a matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) that is 2x2, the text describes how to find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation of \(\mathbf{A} - \lambda\mathbf{I}\). Given the specific matrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & -18 \\
2 & -9
\end{bmatrix},
\]

the characteristic polynomial is derived as \((3-\lambda)(-9-\lambda) + 36 = 0\), simplifying to \(\lambda^2 + 6\lambda + 9 = 0\). This factors into \((\lambda + 3)^2 = 0\), indicating a repeated eigenvalue of \(\lambda = -3\) with multiplicity 2.

Next, the text describes finding eigenvectors and generalized solutions. For the eigenvalue \(-3\), an eigenvector is found by solving:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
6 & -18 \\
2 & -6
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
k_1 \\
k_2
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to \(3k_1 - 9k_2 = 0\) or \(k_1 = 3, k_2 = 1\), giving the eigenvector \(\mathbf{k} = [3, 1]\).

Since only one linearly independent eigenvector is found for a multiplicity of 2, the text uses the generalized eigenvector approach. Solving:

\[
(\mathbf{A} + 3\mathbf{I})\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{k},
\]

yields the generalized eigenvector \(\mathbf{p} = [0.5, 0]\).

The general solution to the system is then expressed as a combination of solutions:

\[
\mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} e^{-3t} + c_2 \left( t 
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} \right) e^{-3t},
\]

where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants determined by initial conditions. This solution reflects both the eigenvector and generalized eigenvector contributions due to the repeated eigenvalue.
