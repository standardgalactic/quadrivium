The text describes a scenario where an object is set into motion with zero initial velocity, leading to certain simplifications in its equation of motion. Initially, two constants, \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), are involved in the expression for position as a function of time. However, due to the condition that the initial velocity (represented by \( x' \)) is zero, \( c_2 \) becomes 0 because it's associated with a term involving sine which would otherwise represent an initial velocity component.

As a result, only \( c_1 \) remains in the equation for position over time. The simplified expression for \( x(t) \), which describes the motion of the object, is now given by \( c_1 \cos(10\sqrt{2}t) \). The value of \( c_1 \) is specified as 0.1, making it the amplitude of oscillation. Therefore, the position oscillates with an amplitude of 0.1 units, moving between +0.1 and -0.1. This describes a simple harmonic motion where the object moves back and forth symmetrically about its equilibrium point.
