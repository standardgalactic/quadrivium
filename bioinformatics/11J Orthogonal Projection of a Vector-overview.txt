The text explains how to work with vectors and their angles within a three-dimensional right-hand coordinate system. It introduces unit vectors \( \mathbf{i} \), \( \mathbf{j} \), and \( \mathbf{k} \) corresponding to the x, y, and z axes, respectively, each having a magnitude of 1.

A vector \( \mathbf{v} \) with components \( (a, b, c) \) is considered. The angles between \( \mathbf{v} \) and the unit vectors are denoted as \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), and \( \gamma \). The task is to show that the cosine of these angles can be expressed in terms of the components of \( \mathbf{v} \) and its magnitude.

1. **Cosine of Angles**:
   - The cosine of angle \( \alpha \) between \( \mathbf{v} \) and \( \mathbf{i} \) is given by:
     \[
     \cos(\alpha) = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{i}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \frac{a}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
     \]
   - Similarly, for angles \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \):
     \[
     \cos(\beta) = \frac{b}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
     \]
     \[
     \cos(\gamma) = \frac{c}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
     \]

2. **Normalized Vector**:
   - The normalized vector \( \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \) is expressed as:
     \[
     \left( \frac{a}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}, \frac{b}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}, \frac{c}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \right)
     \]
   - This shows that the components of the normalized vector are the cosines of the angles \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), and \( \gamma \).

3. **Sum of Squares of Cosines**:
   - The sum of the squares of these cosines equals 1:
     \[
     \cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta) + \cos^2(\gamma) = \left(\frac{a}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{c}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\right)^2
     \]
   - Simplifying, this becomes:
     \[
     \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{\|\mathbf{v}\|^2} = 1
     \]
   - Since \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 \), the equation holds true, confirming that:
     \[
     \cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta) + \cos^2(\gamma) = 1
     \]

This demonstrates the relationship between a vector's components and its direction cosines in three-dimensional space.
