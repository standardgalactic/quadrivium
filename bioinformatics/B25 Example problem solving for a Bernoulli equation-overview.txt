The text provides a detailed process for solving a differential equation using Bernoulli's method. Initially presented with an equation \( \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{xy} = xy^2 \), the solution involves substituting \( y = u^{-1} \) to transform it into a linear form, as \( n=2 \). The substitution changes \( y \) and its derivative, leading to \( \frac{du}{dx} = -u^{-2}(\frac{dy}{dx}) \).

The solution discusses recognizing singular solutionsâ€”solutions not fitting the general family defined by an arbitrary constant. By setting \( y = 0 \), it's noted that this satisfies the original equation as a singular solution.

Next, using the substitution and rearranging terms, the transformed equation becomes linear in terms of \( u \). An integrating factor is calculated as \( e^{-\ln|x|} = x^{-1} \), simplifying further steps. Multiplying through by this factor integrates to find \( u/x = -x + c_1 \).

Reverting back to \( y \) using the original substitution, we obtain a family of solutions: 

\[ y = \frac{1}{cx - x^2} \]

The singular solution \( y=0 \) is noted separately, as it cannot be derived from the general form for any constant \( c \). This highlights the complete set of solutions: both the parametric family and the singular case.
