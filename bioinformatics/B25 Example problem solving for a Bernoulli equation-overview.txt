The text provides a detailed process for solving a differential equation using Bernoulli's method. Initially presented with an equation \( \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{xy} = xy^2 \), the solution involves substituting \( y = u^{-1} \) to transform it into a linear form, as \( n=2 \). The substitution changes \( y \) and its derivative, leading to \( \frac{du}{dx} = -u^{-2}(\frac{dy}{dx}) \).

The solution discusses recognizing singular solutionsâ€”solutions not fitting the general family defined by an arbitrary constant. By setting \( y = 0 \), it's noted that this satisfies the original equation as a singular solution.

Next, using the substitution and rearranging terms, the transformed equation becomes linear in terms of \( u \). An integrating factor is calculated as \( e^{-\ln|x|} = x^{-1} \), simplifying further steps. Multiplying through by this factor integrates to find \( u/x = -x + c_1 \).

Reverting back to \( y \) using the original substitution, we obtain a family of solutions: 

\[ y = \frac{1}{cx - x^2} \]

The singular solution \( y=0 \) is noted separately, as it cannot be derived from the general form for any constant \( c \). This highlights the complete set of solutions: both the parametric family and the singular case.

The text outlines the process of solving a Bernoulli differential equation and highlights the concept of a singular solution. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The original differential equation is given, but it lacks constant coefficients, prompting division by \( x \). This transforms it into a form that resembles a Bernoulli equation with \( n = 2 \).

2. **Substitution**: A substitution \( y = u^{-1} \) is applied to simplify the equation. The derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is expressed in terms of \( u \), using the chain rule.

3. **Simplification**: After substituting, the equation is manipulated to isolate \( \frac{du}{dx} \). This involves multiplying through by negative powers of \( u \) to simplify and linearize the equation.

4. **Integrating Factor**: An integrating factor is determined using the standard form of a linear differential equation, resulting in \( x^{-1} \).

5. **Solution Process**: The equation is solved using the integrating factor, leading to an expression for \( u \) in terms of \( x \). Reverting back from \( u \) to \( y \), the general solution is found.

6. **Singular Solution**: It's noted that \( y = 0 \) is a singular solution, which does not fit into the family of solutions derived from the constant \( c \).

7. **Conclusion**: The complete solution includes both the family of solutions parameterized by \( c \) and the singular solution \( y = 0 \). Verification steps are suggested to ensure correctness.

The text emphasizes understanding both general and singular solutions in differential equations, with a focus on methodical substitution and integration techniques.
