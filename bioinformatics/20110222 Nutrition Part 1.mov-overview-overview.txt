This text outlines the critical role of nutritional support for surgical patients, emphasizing that malnutrition can lead to increased complications such as higher morbidity rates, prolonged hospital stays, delayed recovery, elevated mortality, frequent readmissions, and greater healthcare costs. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as an imbalance between nutrient supply and demand, affecting individuals who are underweight, overweight, or obese.

Nutrients are divided into macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements), with deficiencies contributing to various forms of malnutrition. The goals for surgical nutrition have shifted from maintaining lean body mass to addressing the hypermetabolic effects of acute or chronic malnutrition through stabilization of lean mass, prevention of inflammation, modulation of immune function, and glycemic control.

Identifying malnourished patients involves clinical assessments like weight loss history, physical exams for signs such as temporal wasting, skin changes, muscle wasting, and technical methods including BMI, mid-arm muscle circumference, triceps skin folds, hand grip strength, and biochemical markers like albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin.

Certain patient groups are more prone to malnutrition due to conditions that increase their energy needs, such as pancreatitis, burns, intracutaneous fistula, bowel failure, liver disease, chronic alcoholism, critical illnesses, polytrauma, or head injuries. These patients require tailored nutritional support.

The text also references scoring systems like the prognostic nutritional index and subjective global assessment to evaluate malnutrition risk, but it stresses that healthcare providers should use clinical judgment alongside these tools for effective identification and management of malnutrition in surgical patients.
