The text describes how to perform a statistical analysis using a t-test with the goal of comparing the means of two sets of numerical data. This involves calculating a p-value, which is crucial for determining if there is a statistically significant difference between the dataset means. The use of a t-test facilitates this comparison process by assessing whether any observed differences are likely due to chance or reflect true variation between the datasets.
