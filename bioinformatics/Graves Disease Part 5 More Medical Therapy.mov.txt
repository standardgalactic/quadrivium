In this video I continue the discussion on medical treatment of Graves disease and will
consider the use of lithium, cholestyramine and the immunomodulator rituximab.
Lithium probably affects both hormone synthesis and release.
Its use has been published in papers with respect to the use in the period where thionamides
are discontinued before and after radioactive iodine therapy, in cases of amiodarone induced
thyrotoxicosis and with respect to cases of severe thyrotoxicosis in patients allergic
to iodide.
The dose is usually 300mg per day and the serum level should be monitored to avoid toxicity
and kept below 1mEq per liter.
Cholestyramine is a resin that binds various elements in the small bowel, including biliary
excreted conjugated thyroid hormone.
Normally some of this conjugated thyroid hormone is deconjugated in the gut and reabsorbed,
this enterohepatic circulation is increased in thyrotoxicosis and cholestyramine can be
used effectively.
More novel approaches to the treatment of Graves disease are currently under investigation
and small studies are being published on the use of immunomodulatory drugs such as rituximab,
which is a monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 expressed by pre-B cells before differentiating
to plasma cells.
The resultant cell depletion affects disease processes where plasma cells damage tissue such
as in Graves disease.
Other immunomodulatory drugs are under investigation too.
Hopefully future video series may include some successes with these classes of drugs, but
for now they remain experimental and their widespread efficacy and safety in Graves disease
have been proven.
In the next video I will take a look at the use of radioactive iodine therapy for Graves disease.
