I just wanted to iterate one concept and we have a PV diagram and this is one isotherm
and a second isotherm.
So the only difference between these two is T and that one is T plus delta T.
We start in sub-initial position.
We go to one third final position, second final position and third final position.
You'll see number one is isochotic or as we might say in medicine isovalemic.
It's the same volume so there's no work done there.
Part three would be isobaric inasmuch as the pressure stays constant.
Now for the first law of thermodynamics, delta E internal is going to equal Q minus W.
So for all three of those parts it's going to be different inasmuch as we have different processes going on.
But irrespective of which one of those parts we take, the only thing that changed here is delta T.
We only added delta T there.
So the change in internal energy equals stop NCV delta T or C over 2 NR delta T.
It's only delta T that differs between these.
So even though this might have different values, the change for going from one isotherm to the other, irrespective of where the final process is,
there's still the same difference in internal energy.
And remember if you just want to look at internal energy,
that gas has at that moment not a change in internal energy is NCVT.
Okay, so now we understand the molar specific heat and the constant volume.
Let's look at molar specific heat for constant pressure.
And this is going to be Q equals NC.
Now this time it's constant pressure delta T.
And again first law of thermodynamics delta T internal equals Q minus W.
Q minus W.
And we can replace this for Q.
Now remember this is constant work.
And what is work if the pressure remains constant?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
That it's P volume 5 minus volume initial from,
remember the integral of getting some initial volume to some final volume of P to V.
Where P is just a constant.
Please replace all these values.
And remember that PV equals NRT from the ideal gas law.
And what we'll notice is that Cp equals Cv plus R.
I couldn't do this whole derivation,
but certainly you can see that Cp is actually larger than Cv.
And it turns out that Cp equals Cv plus R.
So that's the important one to remember.
So remember for one atomic,
for one atomic that was 3 over 2R,
this R for 5 over 2 for diatomic and 3R.
So that will be Cp will be 4R for polyatomic gases.
So just remember this one.
Again just this concept of if I have these isotherms,
so that's T,
that's T plus delta T,
and that's T plus, for instance,
2 delta T.
It does not matter.
The change if I have this path,
I have this one,
I have this,
I have so many when I have,
and I have that one.
If you had to rank them in descending order of change in internal energy,
this path will be more.
Because the only thing,
in respect of how the path follows,
with the first law of thermodynamics,
the only thing that's changing here is delta T between these.
So this one will have the largest change in internal.
Now here is a lovely problem to start with,
just to make sure that there's no confusion between Q, E,
and delta E internal.
There's a 5 mol bubble of a monatomic ideal gas in water.
And you heat the bubble, the water,
and therefore the bubble by 20 kelvins.
The pressure remains constant.
We don't know what the change in volume is.
And the question is,
when this temperature increases,
obviously energy is transferred to that bubble in the form of heat.
What is that amount of heat transferred?
Now this is Q equals,
and think about this very carefully,
N, C, P, delta T.
Do not get confused between delta E internal and its equations,
and Q and its equations.
Q and its equations.
Now we can do this,
if we know, say for instance that monatomic gas was helium,
and we know this,
the molar specific heat and the constant pressure of helium.
If we knew that, we could do that problem.
We also know that N equals,
Cp equals Cv plus R delta T.
We know that Cp for a monatomic ideal gas is 3 over 2.
So that is going to be 3 over 2R plus 2 over 2R delta T.
So this is going to equal 5 over 2R delta T.
Now the question is,
so this is Q.
Please remember,
Q, not delta E internal.
Now the question comes.
I think the second part of the question,
what is the change,
what is the change
in internal energy of the helium
during the temperature increase?
Now,
we've got to now look at the equations for,
and I've done it here before,
just looking at what I did.
The change in internal energy.
So now we're looking at
the equations for change in internal energy.
Delta E internal.
Remember that is 3 over 2NR delta T.
So we were given N,
we know the value of R equals 3,
1,
and we were given delta T.
So it's easy for us to say
what the change in internal energy was.
The last part of the question,
how much work is done by the helium
as it expands?
And there are two ways to do this.
Inasmuch as we can remember the work done
under constant pressure.
Work done under constant pressure
equals that pressure times delta V.
We're not told what delta V is,
but remember P delta V to the ideal gas law
equals NR delta T.
And we certainly know that.
So we can work out work
under constant pressure here
is going to equal NR delta T.
And remember where I got this from,
it's from the integral
under constant pressure.
So we can do it that way.
Another way to do it
is to remember the first law of thermodynamics.
And this is beautiful
because you can check your answer
in two ways.
change in internal energy
equals Q minus W.
In other words,
let's get another piece of chalk.
I need some white chalk.
In other words, work.
Work was going to equal Q minus delta E internal.
So we can do work in two ways in this problem.
And we should get to exactly the same answer.
But please please please do not get confused between these two.
Don't get confused between these two.
Which equations belong to heat
and which belong to change in internal energy.
several others.
If they don't have instant power to temperature,
they're going to be非常的 busy in real life.
So, for more than anything,
let's show up our daily thinking.
And what's next in another day.
so, solidICA,
it goes to hablamos andNot- PPE.
Do not?
Again, that's what I want to do to do.
You couldn't menace Fachwarfaat.
