The text discusses the importance of effectively managing diabetic patients in a surgical setting due to their increased risk of complications and mortality. It begins by defining normal glucose levels (60-90 mg/dL) and describes how fasting blood glucose levels between 100-125 mg/dL indicate pre-diabetes, while levels above 125 mg/dL signify diabetes. Pre-diabetics may become glucose intolerant due to factors like medication or stress. Two types of diabetes are described: Type 1 (insulin insufficient) and Type 2 (insulin resistant). It is noted that a significant portion of the population, particularly in America, may be diabetic or pre-diabetic, with many unaware of their condition.

The text advises against developing new diabetic care protocols from scratch, as existing evidence-based ones are usually available. Instead, healthcare providers should familiarize themselves with these established protocols and collaborate with medical and anesthetic colleagues to ensure proper care for diabetic patients in surgical units.
