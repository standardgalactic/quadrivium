The text discusses the importance of effectively managing diabetic patients in a surgical setting due to their increased risk of complications and mortality. It begins by defining normal glucose levels (60-90 mg/dL) and describes how fasting blood glucose levels between 100-125 mg/dL indicate pre-diabetes, while levels above 125 mg/dL signify diabetes. Pre-diabetics may become glucose intolerant due to factors like medication or stress. Two types of diabetes are described: Type 1 (insulin insufficient) and Type 2 (insulin resistant). It is noted that a significant portion of the population, particularly in America, may be diabetic or pre-diabetic, with many unaware of their condition.

The text advises against developing new diabetic care protocols from scratch, as existing evidence-based ones are usually available. Instead, healthcare providers should familiarize themselves with these established protocols and collaborate with medical and anesthetic colleagues to ensure proper care for diabetic patients in surgical units.

The text focuses on the importance of managing diabetic patients in surgical settings due to their higher risk of complications, including increased mortality rates. Key points include:

1. **Diagnosis and Classification:**
   - Normal fasting blood glucose levels range from 60-90 mg/dL (3.3-5 mmol/L).
   - Fasting blood glucose levels between 100-125 mg/dL (5.5-6.9 mmol/L) indicate pre-diabetes.
   - A level above 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) confirms diabetes, warranting a glucose tolerance test.

2. **Types of Diabetes:**
   - Type 1: Characterized by insulin insufficiency due to beta cell problems.
   - Type 2: Marked by insulin resistance, often seen in obese individuals, where the body produces insulin but is resistant to its effects.

3. **Prevalence and Awareness:**
   - Approximately 10% of patients may be diabetic, with half being unaware of their condition.
   - Up to 25% are pre-diabetic, with a significant risk (60-70%) of progressing to diabetes.

4. **Management in Surgical Settings:**
   - Diabetics require careful management due to higher complication rates.
   - Most healthcare institutions have existing protocols based on evidence and experience for diabetic care during surgery.
   - Surgical teams should consult medical and anesthetic colleagues and familiarize themselves with institutional protocols, rather than developing new ones independently. 

This summary underscores the need for effective collaboration among healthcare professionals in managing diabetic patients undergoing surgical procedures to mitigate risks and improve outcomes.
