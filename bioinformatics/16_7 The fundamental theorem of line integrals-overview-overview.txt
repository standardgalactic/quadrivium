The text explains the fundamental theorem of line integrals in multivariable calculus, drawing an analogy to the fundamental theorem of calculus from single-variable calculus. It highlights that when a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is conservative (i.e., it can be expressed as the gradient of some scalar function \( f \), where \( \nabla f = \mathbf{F} \)), the line integral of this vector field between two points depends only on those endpoints, not the path taken. This property is known as path independence.

The theorem states that for a conservative vector field \( \mathbf{F} = \nabla f \), the line integral along a curve from point \( a \) to point \( b \) equals the difference in the scalar function's values at these points: 

\[
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = f(b) - f(a)
\]

This result implies that computations like work, modeled by line integrals of conservative fields, are determined solely by the endpoints. The curve \( C \) can be piecewise smooth as long as each segment is suitable for integration and lies within the domain where \( \mathbf{F} \) is defined.

The theorem simplifies calculations in physics and engineering by reducing complex path-dependent integrals to straightforward evaluations at boundary points, making it a powerful tool for practical applications.
