The text addresses solving a differential equation involving trigonometric functions by identifying parameters and an appropriate annihilating operator. Key points include:

- Parameters: \( \alpha = -1 \) and \( \beta = 2 \).
- The presence of an \( x^0 \) term suggests \( n = 1 \).
- Calculations:
  - \( d^2 \)
  - \( -2\alpha d \), which simplifies to \( +2d \) due to \(\alpha = -1\).
  - \( \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 5 \).

The differential equation is:

\[ d^2 - 2\alpha d + (\alpha^2 + \beta^2) = 0 \]

Simplified, it becomes:

\[ d^2 + 2d + 5 = 0 \]

An annihilating operator is used to eliminate cosine and sine terms from the equation. This operator works for any power \( n \), confirming \( n = 1 \) when \( x^0 \) is present. The solution involves applying this operator to simplify the differential equation.
