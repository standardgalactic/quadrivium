The text outlines a method for determining the enthalpy change (\(\Delta H^\circ\)) and entropy change (\(\Delta S^\circ\)) associated with the equilibrium between two states (A and B) of a protein. At equilibrium, the ratio of concentrations of state B to A is constant and described by the equilibrium constant \(K_{\text{eq}}\). The free energy change (\(\Delta G^\circ\)) at equilibrium can be expressed through equations involving temperature, the universal gas constant \(R\), \(\Delta H^\circ\), and \(\Delta S^\circ\).

To find these thermodynamic parameters, experiments are conducted to measure \(K_{\text{eq}}\) across various temperatures. Plotting the natural log of \(K_{\text{eq}}\) against the inverse temperature (\(1/T\)) yields a straight line. This linear relationship is described by the equation \(Y = MX + C\), where \(M\) (the slope) equals \(-\Delta H^\circ/R\) and \(C\) (the intercept) equals \(\Delta S^\circ/R\). From this graph, \(\Delta H^\circ\) and \(\Delta S^\circ\) can be calculated using the slope and intercept of the line. This approach combines experimental data with mathematical modeling to determine the thermodynamic properties of the protein's state transition.
