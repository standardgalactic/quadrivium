Let's do this quick problem so that we see that this doesn't really differ from any of the equations that we used in transverse waves, and that there's just a slight little trick in it as well, but because I put the curly braces around there, which was not put in the original problem that I did, it might catch you up, but certainly it's not that difficult.
So we have the change in pressure as a function of x and t as that, and we want to know what the change in maximum amplitude is going to be, that's very simple, we can read that off of that, 1.50 pascal, which is directly, I've taken it off now, which is directly read from the frequency.
How are we going to do frequency? Well, remember that omega equals 2 pi times the frequency, in other words, the frequency is going to be omega divided by 2 pi, what is omega in this?
You might say that's 315 inverse seconds, but it's not, it's just a little trick that there's a pi there as well, so this is going to be 315 pi inverse seconds divided by 2 pi,
those will cancel, those will cancel, and this is going to be, I did it before, 157.5 equals seconds, because we're dealing with 3 significant digits in this problem, it's going to be about 158 seconds.
Same goes for lambda, we remember, what is the equation for lambda, inclusive of the angular wave number, and this angular wave number equals 2 pi divided by lambda,
in other words, lambda is going to equal 2 pi divided by the angular wave number, and that's going to equal 2 pi divided by, now what is scale, again the same little trick there, in as much as there is a pi there,
it's going to be 0.9 pi inverse meters, and the pi's will cancel out, 2 divided by 0.9 is 20 over 9 meters,
and with 2 significant digits, so it comes to about 2.22 meters, and lastly we want the velocity of, velocity of this wave, and this easiest of the lot,
if you didn't make any mistakes here, it's going to be frequency times, frequency times, frequency times, wavelength,
and that works out to exactly 350 meters, per second, as simple as, as simple as, as simple as all of that, we could have also just used,
instead of frequency times, lambda, we could have also used, equals, omega divided by, by k, and as long as we put in the fact that omega is actually,
315 pi, and k was 0.95, and that's what's going to cancel out, because I said, exactly the same, exactly the same equation, okay.
Here is a lovely problem, we're given an equation for, the displacement, in x and t of 6 nanometers, times the cosine of kx plus,
3,000 inverse seconds, t plus phi, and we want to know, how much time elapses, how much time elapses,
for s to go from 2 nanometers to minus 2 nanometers, so for that element to go from 2 nanometers to minus 2 nanometers,
to negative 2 nanometers, there's probably more than one way to look at this, but, in essence, it's quite simple,
we want to know, if this is 2 and this is 1, we want to know t2 minus t1, the difference between the 2, or delta t.
Well, let's just, we are given some values, so, for the first one, we could have 2.0 nanometers,
equals 6.0 nanometers, times the cosine of kx plus 3,000,
I'm not going to write the, oh, well, let's do it, t plus phi,
and if I take this to this side, I'm just going to be left with a third on the other side,
just a third dimensionless, because an enemy is divided by an enemy,
and if I put negative 2 in again, I'm going to get negative a third,
I'm going to get negative a third, equals the cosine of kx plus 3,000 nanometers seconds t plus phi,
plus phi.
Now, I need to get, I need to get to this oscillating factor,
one thing I didn't mention when we just looked at the equations,
first off, inside the brackets, this is the oscillating factor,
but what I can do is, I can just take the arc cosine,
arc cosine on this side,
that gets me, that gets rid of the cosine,
and this cosine,
let me just get some more chalk,
that gets rid of those two cosines,
arc cosine,
and now I have exposed
these factors, and I can deal with them directly.
So, what I'm looking at is what is
one minus the other one,
the second time 2 minus t1,
so I'm going to have the arc cosine of negative a third,
minus the arc cosine of a third,
is going to equal this,
kx plus 3000 t,
let's call that t2,
plus phi,
minus this,
so it's minus kx,
minus the 3000 t1,
minus phi,
so the phi's are going to go,
the kx's are going to go,
I can take our 3000 as a common factor,
and I'm left with t2 minus t1,
which is the term I'm looking for,
and whatever the arc cosine of negative a third is,
minus the arc cosine of a third,
I'm going to divide that by 3000,
and I'm left with the difference between the two times,
and if you plug in those values,
t2 minus t1 is going to get you,
which I just did,
as 0 point,
if I round it off,
0 point,
I'm going to move that side,
so it's 0.23,
micro,
oops,
no,
that's going to be milliseconds,
so on the calculator,
it's actually 2.3 times 10 to the power negative 4 seconds,
I move one that side,
this becomes a negative 3,
which is 0.23 milliseconds,
so in the end,
all I needed to do is just to expose,
the oscillating factor,
so that I could algebraically,
just get to them,
now,
let's do a fantastic,
an absolutely fantastic copy,
we know the equation for displacement,
of a longitudinal wave,
which is added the phase angle there,
and we are told,
you won't be told this as neatly as it's written here,
but what you will be told is that,
at some x equals 2 meter,
in an longitudinal wave,
so the x position of 2 meters,
the displacement,
so s,
the displacement is 6 nanometers,
and we are also told that,
that's the maximum amplitude,
that's the amplitude,
so it's the maximum displacement,
so we also know that this equals,
s,
n,
we are also told that,
at an x value of 2.07 meters,
down this tube,
with a sound wave in,
we get a displacement of 2 nanometers,
and we tell that the velocity is,
343 meters per second of that wave,
what is the frequency of this wave,
what is the frequency of this wave,
now we have two situations here,
we do have an s1 and an s2,
let's write the equations with what we have,
with what we have,
let's write the two equations,
so we're going to write the s1,
is going to be 6 nanometers,
6 nanometers equals,
now sm is also 6 nanometers,
6 nanometers,
times the cosine of,
now x here is 2 meters,
so it's 2 meters times k,
minus,
we don't know omega,
we don't know t,
we don't know phi,
if we just simplify this,
6 nanometers divided by,
6 on this side is 1,
when will the cosine,
the cosine of what angle is 1,
well the cosine of 0 is 1,
so the arc cosine,
of 1 equals 0,
so we'll have 0 equals this,
this is going to equal 0,
we can all see that,
so 2k,
I'm leaving the meters out now,
because I've divided away the nanometers,
so 2k minus omega t plus phi,
equals 0,
and because I've looked at this problem before,
just before I made this video,
I'm going to do something weird,
I'm just going to write omega t on its own,
you'll see why in that shortly,
there's 2k plus phi,
okay,
let's look at the second equation,
you're going to have 2 nanometers,
equals 6 nanometers,
times again the cosine,
but that's not 2 meters,
but 2.07,
2.07k minus omega t plus phi,
if I divide this in here now,
I'm going to get a third,
equals the cosine,
oops,
cosine of 2 times,
2.07k minus omega t plus phi,
and if I take an arc cosine of the third,
I'm left with this oscillating factor,
so I can work with the factors,
that are in there,
so I'm going to get the arc cosine of a third,
equals 2.07k minus omega t plus phi,
now I have two equations,
one, two equations,
and I need to get rid of quite a few,
of these unknowns,
but look at these unknowns,
they're exactly the same in these two equations,
so I know I'm going to be able to get rid of them,
so what's going to happen,
and that's why I wrote the omega t on its own here,
because I just want to replace this omega t with this,
remember I need to solve for k,
because I need to get to frequency,
and I don't know what omega is,
I don't know what t is,
I don't know what phi is,
and if I can get rid of them,
I should,
because it's only through k,
that I'm going to get,
the wavelength,
and I have the wavelength,
and I have the velocity,
I will pop the frequency,
so that's what I'm going to replace,
with this omega t,
so I'm left with an arc cosine,
of a third,
equals 2.07k,
minus,
and for omega t,
for omega t,
I'm going to put,
2k plus that,
so it'll be negative 2k,
negative phi,
negative phi,
and then still this positive phi there,
so I'm going to get,
negative phi plus to phi,
and rid of the phi's,
2 minus,
2.07 minus,
2 is going to be,
0.07,
0.07k,
equals the arc cosine of a third,
of a third,
or k is going to equal,
the arc cosine,
of a third,
divided by 0.07,
and we said,
that frequency,
equals velocity,
divided by lambda,
we know that,
lambda equals,
2 pi over k,
lambda equals,
2 pi over k,
so here I'm going to have,
frequency equals velocity,
divided by 2 pi over k,
or velocity of times k,
divided by 2 pi,
and I know what k is,
so we're going to have,
velocity,
times the arc,
cosine of a third,
divided by 0.07,
times 2 pi,
and if you plug,
those values in,
you're going to get,
to about,
960 hertz,
960 hertz,
again,
in the final analysis,
this is quite a simple,
algebraic problem,
but you've got to know,
what the question is telling you,
and when you do have,
these equations,
you've got to realize,
that you can't get rid,
of these unknown factors,
because they're exactly,
the same,
in both of your equations,
then it becomes easy,
when k is on its own,
and you get a wave number,
and when you're doing,
the wave number,
it's so easy,
because it's related,
to the wavelength,
you have the velocity,
and you have,
now have,
you have,
by this equation,
you have the wavelength,
so,
it's such a nice problem,
but in the end,
it's basic algebra,
and it's easy to solve.
Thank you.
Thank you.
