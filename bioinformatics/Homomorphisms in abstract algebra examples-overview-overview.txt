The provided text explores examples of determining whether specific functions between groups are homomorphisms by checking if they preserve the group operation. Here's a summary:

1. **First Example:**
   - Groups \( g \) (integers under addition) and \( h \) (fourth roots of unity under multiplication) are considered.
   - The function \( f(x) = i^x \) is analyzed to see if it preserves the operation from \( g \) to \( h \).
   - Verification: For integers \( a, b, c \in g \) such that \( a + b = c \), \( f(a)f(b) = i^{a+b} = i^c = f(c) \). Thus, \( f \) is a homomorphism.

2. **Second Example:**
   - Groups \( g \) (real numbers under addition) and \( h \) (complex numbers with norm 1 under multiplication) are considered.
   - The function \( f(x) = e^{ix} \) maps from \( g \) to \( h \).
   - Verification: For real numbers \( a, b, c \in g \) such that \( a + b = c \), \( f(a)f(b) = e^{i(a+b)} = e^{ic} = f(c) \). Therefore, \( f \) is a homomorphism.

3. **Third Example:**
   - The text suggests a group mapping onto itself but does not provide details or calculations for this case.

Additionally, the text presents an example with the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) from real numbers under addition to themselves:

- To be a homomorphism, it must satisfy \( f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) \).
- For \( f(x) = x^2 \), this requires \( (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 \).
- However, \( (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \), which implies \( 0 = 2ab \), not true for all real numbers.
- Thus, \( f(x) = x^2 \) does not preserve the group operation and is not a homomorphism.

Overall, these examples illustrate how to verify if a function between groups maintains the structure necessary to be considered a homomorphism.
