The text addresses solving a specific type of non-homogeneous linear differential equation involving second-order derivatives. Initially, an error was found due to a missing factor of \( x \) in the setup. By correcting this, the problem reduces to finding roots for the quadratic equation \( 3m^2 + 3m + 1 = 0 \). The solutions are complex: \( m = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}i \).

Using these roots, the solution is expressed as:

\[ y = x^{-\frac{1}{2}} (c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \ln x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \ln x)) \]

The discussion highlights how easily mistakes can occur if one is too narrowly focused and stresses the importance of maintaining vigilance in problem-solving, even outside formal testing environments.
