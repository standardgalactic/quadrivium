Let's break down the problem you're addressing regarding light waves reflecting off mirrors and causing destructive interference.

### Understanding Destructive Interference

Destructive interference occurs when two waves are out of phase by half a wavelength (\(\lambda/2\)). This means that the crest of one wave aligns with the trough of another, resulting in cancellation or reduction of amplitude at certain points.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Situation 1**: A light beam reflects off a single plane mirror. The incident and reflected beams are initially in phase and have a wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of 620 nanometers in air.

2. **Situation 2**: An additional plane mirror is placed at a distance \(L\) from the first mirror, forming an "optical path" where light travels to the second mirror and back.

### Calculating Path Differences

- **Path for Situation 1 (N1)**: The light travels to the mirror and back, covering a total optical path length of \(2L\). Thus, the number of wavelengths fitting into this path is:
  \[
  N_1 = \frac{2L}{\lambda}
  \]

- **Path for Situation 2 (N2)**: The light travels to the second mirror and back through an additional segment. It covers \(4L\) in total (to the second mirror and back twice). Thus, the number of wavelengths fitting into this path is:
  \[
  N_2 = \frac{4L}{\lambda}
  \]

### Condition for Destructive Interference

For destructive interference, the difference in the number of wavelengths between the two paths should be a half wavelength (\(\lambda/2\)):
\[
N_2 - N_1 = \frac{\lambda}{2}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(N_1\) and \(N_2\):
\[
\frac{4L}{\lambda} - \frac{2L}{\lambda} = \frac{\lambda}{2}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\frac{2L}{\lambda} = \frac{\lambda}{2}
\]

Solving for \(L\):
\[
2L = \frac{\lambda^2}{2}
\]
\[
L = \frac{\lambda}{4}
\]

Given \(\lambda = 620\) nm:
\[
L = \frac{620 \, \text{nm}}{4} = 155 \, \text{nm}
\]

### Finding the Next Point of Destructive Interference

To find the next position where total destructive interference occurs, add a full wavelength to the initial condition:
\[
N_2 - N_1 = \frac{\lambda}{2} + \lambda = \frac{3\lambda}{2}
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{2L}{\lambda} = \frac{3\lambda}{2}
\]

Solving for \(L\):
\[
2L = \frac{3\lambda^2}{2}
\]
\[
L = \frac{3\lambda}{4}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda = 620\) nm:
\[
L = \frac{3 \times 620 \, \text{nm}}{4} = 465 \, \text{nm}
\]

### Conclusion

- The minimum distance \(L\) for the first instance of total destructive interference is **155 nanometers**.
- The next position where total destructive interference occurs is at **465 nanometers**. 

This approach uses the concept of optical path difference and conditions for destructive interference to solve the problem.

The text discusses the concept of wavelength and phase difference related to light or waves with a specific focus on 465 nanometers. It highlights an equation used to determine how many wavelengths fit into a unit length, \( L \). The main question addressed is determining how far one should move from an initial position based on these calculations. The key point is understanding the phase difference between two rays as they travel and reach a specific point, emphasizing the number of wavelengths that pass through each unit length and their impact on phase differences.
