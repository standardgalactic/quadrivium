The equation for the area of a triangle is half times the length of the base times the
height. It is because two similar triangles make a rectangle. There are also other equations
for the area of a triangle. Consider again the triangle that we used in the video on
the sine relationship. If S stands for surface area, the area of triangle ABC would be S
equals a half CH. H can be expressed in a number of ways. With sine of A equals H over B, H
equals B sine A. And with sine B equals H over A, H equals A sine B. Substituting for H leaves
us with other equations for the area of a triangle. S equals a half CB sine A or S equals a half
CA sine B. And through symmetry we can show that S equals a half AB sine C. There are
yet other ways to express the area of a triangle. Looking at triangles CAP and CBP separately,
we note that by the Pythagorean theorem, B squared equals H squared plus C minus X squared. And
A squared equals H squared plus X squared. Through algebraic manipulation, we can write these
two equations as H squared equals B squared minus C minus X squared. And H squared equals
A squared minus X squared. Since H is common to both triangles, we can write A squared minus
X squared equals B squared minus C squared minus 2CX plus X squared for triangle ABC where we have
expanded the C minus X squared. This leaves us with A squared minus X squared equals B squared
minus C squared plus 2CX minus X squared. The negative X squared on each side cancel and bringing
2CX on its own side leaves 2CX equals A squared minus B squared plus C squared. And solving for
X leaves X equals X equals A squared minus B squared plus C squared over 2C. With H squared
equals A squared minus X squared, H would be the square root of A squared minus X squared.
Substituting our known value of X leaves us with H equals the square root of A squared minus
A squared minus B squared plus C squared over 2C squared. And since the surface area equals
a half times C equals a half times C times H for triangle ABC, we can substitute our known
value of H and we get surface area equals a half times C times the square root of A squared
minus A squared minus B squared plus C squared or squared over 4C squared. There are many other
ways to express the area of a triangle. In the next video, we will look at the cosine relationship.
