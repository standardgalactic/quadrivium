Let us do another problem to see if we fully understand this.
This is the temperature of 2.00 moles of an ideal monatomic gas.
We read the problem so we go.
N equals, what are our thought processes as we read this?
The temperature of 2.00 moles of an ideal monatomic gas.
So N equals 2.00 mole.
My first thought.
Three significant digit problem.
I need to give my answers as three significant digits.
Of an ideal monatomic gas.
Its ideal is monatomic.
So I immediately know.
Let us see.
Molar specific heat of constant volume is going to be equal 3 over 2R.
I hope in previous videos I never wrote 2 over 3.
There is no 2 over 3.
It is 3 over 2.
Even kinetic energy is 3 over 2 KT.
Maltzman's constant times temperature.
So as I read this.
I have seen that 2.00 mole.
First thought.
Three significant digits.
It is ideal monatomic gas.
So immediately I am thinking Cv equals 3 over 2.
And its temperature is raised by 15 Kelvin.
So delta T equals 15.0 Kelvin.
Again three significant digits.
At constant volume.
So this is a constant volume problem.
So immediately this was correct there.
What are the work done by the gas?
What is the work done under constant volume?
It is zero.
Because remember my integral for work.
I always forget to put the music off.
So it is going from some volume initial to some volume final of PdB.
But here there is no change of volume.
So this equals that.
So my integral is just zero.
There is no work done.
Next question.
The energy transferred as heat.
Heat equals Ncv delta T.
We were given N.
This is monatomic ideal constant volume.
So I can replace that with N 3 over 2 R delta T.
Let's see how beautiful this works out.
Because next question is the change in internal energy.
First of all thermodynamics.
Wait.
That was bad.
Change in internal energy equals Q minus W.
But because work was zero.
This equation and this equation is going to be.
The change in internal energy and Q are going to be exactly the same.
Inasmuch as W is zero in this case.
And lastly what is the change in kinetic energy per atom?
The average kinetic energy per atom equals 3 over 2 K delta T.
If this becomes delta K average.
So a nice problem.
And we can start thinking about stuff as we read the problem.
In this video I just want to have a quick look at the equipartition of energy.
A concept by James Maxwell.
And he wanted to see why the.
Or trying to understand why the molar specific heat's constant volume.
Or then pressure is not the same for monatomic, diatomic and polyatomic.
And this degrees of freedom or the equipartition of energy.
He said that.
All the energy in a.
Gas.
Can be.
Only in certain forms.
And they would come in.
I don't want.
I don't want to call it packets.
But.
Say in units over half times.
The Boltzmann's constant times the temperature.
And if you look at a.
At a monatomic glass.
And you look at what motion.
Those.
Atoms can have.
Well first they can move in a three.
Three dimensional.
Space.
So they can move in the.
I.
I roof.
J roof.
K roof.
Direction.
Three degrees.
Of.
Of.
Freedom.
So this will be.
Three.
And that is where we.
We get the.
Three over two kT.
For.
Each.
Atoms.
Kinetic energy.
Now let's look at.
A.
Diatomic.
Molecule.
So I have.
One.
Two parts to it.
So they can still move.
In that direction.
Translational.
Up.
Down.
Left.
Right.
Front.
Back.
But they can also.
Rotate.
Along each other.
I think the textbook explains.
That they can move.
In the spring.
But let's just look at.
Their rotation.
So.
If I put this down there.
Two.
They can rotate.
This way around each other.
And this way around each other.
But this doesn't count.
This is not rotation.
There's no change.
I can.
I can.
I can.
Any way.
By any amount.
Of radians.
Or degrees.
You won't notice a difference.
Certainly there's a symmetry.
Along this axis.
Of rotation.
So there's actually.
Only.
They can rotate.
This way.
Or they can.
Rotate.
This way.
So that way.
Or this way.
But they.
This rotation.
So there will only be.
Another.
Two.
Half.
KTs.
So this is going to equal.
Three over two.
KT.
And this is going to equal.
One.
KT.
Or two over two.
So two over two.
KT.
And if you add those together.
You're going to get.
Five over two.
KT.
And that's where we get the.
Five over two.
Um.
Um.
Um.
For.
Um.
Remember.
For.
Diatomic gases.
They have three.
Three.
Polyatomic.
Or more.
They will have.
Three axes.
Of.
Rotational movement.
As well.
So here.
We were going to get.
Another three over two.
And three over two.
Plus three over two.
That's six over two.
And so that's going to equal.
Three.
KT.
For their average.
Kinetic.
For their average.
Kinetic energy.
The last concept.
For this chapter.
Is just to look at.
The two forms.
Of adiabatic processes.
Remember.
Right from the beginning.
We said.
An adiabatic process.
Um.
Two types.
Either.
It occurs.
So quickly.
If you think.
Of a sound wave.
I say.
Hello.
This is compressing.
An expansion.
Of air.
As the wave moves.
It happens.
So quickly.
That they can't be.
Transfer.
Of internal energy.
Of heat.
Actually I should say.
No time.
For transfer.
Of heat.
Um.
Because the process.
Happened so quickly.
So.
Q.
For adiabatic process.
Q equals zero.
There was another form.
Of adiabatic process.
And that was.
The free expansion.
Free expansion.
So.
And those two.
Have quite different.
Uh.
Expansion.
Uh.
Quite different.
Quite different.
Equations.
So.
This is an adiabatic process.
For which.
Q equals zero.
These are isotherms.
From some initial.
To some final state.
So there's a.
Change in temperature.
And so definitely.
There's going to be.
A change in internal.
There's going to be.
A change in internal energy.
But not as Q.
Only as work.
And since we have.
A different volume.
Volume initial.
Volume final.
There's a change.
So there is going to be work.
So the only change in internal energy.
Is going to come from work.
And there is a temperature difference.
For this first adiabatic process.
That it happens too quickly.
Or it's so well insulated.
That there's no.
Change in energy.
And what was noted.
Was that.
P.
Pressure.
Times.
The volume.
To the power.
Gamma.
Is a constant.
And what was noted.
Was that.
P.
Pressure.
Times.
The volume.
To the power.
Gamma.
Is a constant.
And what is that gamma.
Well gamma equals.
Cp.
Divided by.
Cv.
Molar specific.
Heat.
Under constant pressure.
Divided by molar specific heat.
At constant volume.
So that was.
That is a constant.
Now.
This line.
Is called.
An adiabatic.
While this was.
Isotherm.
This line.
Is called.
An adiabatic.
And.
If I just get.
P.
On its own.
On this side.
It's going to equal.
Some constant.
Divided by.
V.
To the power.
V.
To the power.
And gamma.
And.
Since the gas.
Goes from.
Some initial state.
Which I was.
Looking at.
Running through.
All the equations.
Quickly.
Sensitized from.
Some initial state.
To some final state.
And they're both equal.
To constants.
Remember.
That.
V initial.
V initial.
To the power.
Gamma.
Is going to equal.
V initial.
V final.
V final.
Also.
To the power.
Gamma.
Is also.
Going to be a constant.
And.
S.
Where.
PV.
Equals.
N.R.
T.
Where.
PV.
Equals.
N.R.
T.
Divide by.
V.
If I.
Replace.
That.
There.
We're.
Also.
Going to see.
N.R.
T.
Over.
V.
And then.
V.
To the power.
Gamma.
Is also.
Going to be a constant.
It's also.
Going to be a constant.
And.
Since.
N.R.
Is going to be a constant.
If I go.
From some initial.
To find.
Some final state.
N is a constant.
C is a constant.
I actually.
Get that.
T.
V.
So.
That's going to be.
Gamma.
Minus.
One.
If I go.
From some initial.
To final state.
Temperature.
Initial.
V.
Initial.
Gamma.
Minus.
One.
Is going to be.
Equal temperature.
Final.
Times.
Volume.
Final.
To the power.
Gamma.
Minus.
One.
So.
Those.
Are.
The important.
The important.
Equations.
This one.
Constant.
And then.
Finally.
This one.
Now.
Let's.
Quickly.
Consider.
Free expansion.
During.
Free expansion.
There's going to be.
No change in temperature.
Just remember that.
Free expansion.
Equals.
temperature.
Equals.
Cost.
So.
Temperature.
Initial.
And.
Temperature.
Final.
If.
Temperature.
Initial.
And.
Temperature.
Final.
Are.
The same.
Remember that.
With.
The.
P.
Initial.
Equals.
P.
Final.
P.
Final.
So.
These.
Are.
Both.
Ediabatic.
Processes.
But.
All.
Of.
This.
Is.
Only.
To.
Do.
Expansion.
We're.
Just.
Talking.
Normal.
Ideal.
Gas.
In.
As.
Much.
As.
This.
Would have been.
Over.
T.
Initial.
Equals.
T.
Final.
Equals.
T.
Final.
So.
That's.
Where.
We.
Are.
Left.
