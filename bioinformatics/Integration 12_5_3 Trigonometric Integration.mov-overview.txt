To solve the problem, we need to express \(\tan(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\), where \(x = \csc(\theta)\).

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**
   - Given: \(x = \csc(\theta) = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite}}\).
   - Therefore, \(\text{hypotenuse} = x\) and \(\text{opposite} = 1\).

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Let the adjacent side be \(p\).
   - According to the theorem: \(p^2 + 1^2 = x^2\).
   - Solving for \(p\): \(p = \sqrt{x^2 - 1}\).

3. **Finding \(\tan(\theta)\):**
   - \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\).

4. **Alternative Expression:**
   - \(\theta = \csc^{-1}(x)\).
   - Therefore, \(\tan(\theta) = \tan(\csc^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\).

This solution demonstrates the reversal of trigonometric substitution by expressing \(\tan(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\) using a right triangle approach.

To solve the problem, we begin with a right triangle where angle \(\theta\) is given. We know \(x = \csc(\theta)\), which means:

\[
\csc(\theta) = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite}} = \frac{x}{1}
\]

Thus, the hypotenuse is \(x\) and the opposite side is 1.

Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the adjacent side (\(p\)):

\[
p^2 + 1^2 = x^2
\]

Solving for \(p\):

\[
p^2 = x^2 - 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p = \sqrt{x^2 - 1}
\]

Now, to find \(\tan(\theta)\), which is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side:

\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}
\]

Alternatively, recognizing that \(\theta = \csc^{-1}(x)\), we express \(\tan(\theta)\) as:

\[
\tan(\theta) = \tan(\csc^{-1}(x))
\]

Thus, the simplified expression for \(\tan(\theta)\) is:

\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}
\] 

This solution involves reversing a trigonometric substitution to express \(\tan(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\).
