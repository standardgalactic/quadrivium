The text provides a mathematical argument demonstrating that a particular set defined as an equivalence class under a specific relation within group theory is equivalent to a left coset. Here's a summary:

1. **Context and Objective**: In the context of a group \( G \) and its subgroup \( H \), the aim is to show that for any element \( A \) in \( G \), an equivalence class defined by a specific relation matches the set formed by composing \( A \) with every element of \( H \).

2. **Equivalence Class Definition**: The equivalence class consists of elements \( X \) such that when you take the inverse of \( X \) and compose it with \( A \), the result is in \( H \). This relation qualifies as an equivalence relation, satisfying properties like symmetry.

3. **Establishing Subset Relations**:
   - It first proves that any element \( X \) in the equivalence class can be written as \( AH \), where \( H \) is an element of \( H \).
   - Then, it shows that if \( X \) can be expressed as \( aH \) (with \( a \in A \)), it satisfies the equivalence relation defining the original equivalence class.

4. **Conclusion**: By demonstrating these subset relations, the text concludes that the equivalence class and the set defined by left cosets are identical. This result is crucial for further mathematical concepts like Lagrange's theorem, which connects subgroup sizes to the order of the group.

Overall, the text proves that an abstract equivalence relation corresponds directly to the concept of left cosets in group theory.
