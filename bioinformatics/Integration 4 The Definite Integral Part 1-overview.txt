The text introduces the concept of definite integrals by adding interval bounds to integration. A definite integral represents the area under a curve within a specified interval, denoted as "the integral from \(a\) to \(b\)" where \(a\) is the lower bound and \(b\) is the upper bound on the x-axis. The process involves evaluating the antiderivative of the function at these bounds and subtracting the results.

The example provided uses the function \(y = 1 - x^2\) from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\). The definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} (1 - x^2) \, dx\) is calculated by finding the antiderivative: \(x - \frac{1}{3}x^3\), evaluated at the bounds. Substituting the upper and lower limits into this expression and subtracting yields an area of \(\frac{2}{3}\). This matches the result obtained using the limit of a Riemann sum, demonstrating consistency between methods for finding areas under curves with definite integrals. Unlike indefinite integrals, definite integrals do not include a constant \(C\), as they are evaluated over specific intervals.

This video introduces the concept of definite integrals by incorporating interval bounds into integration. A definite integral represents the area under a curve between two specified points, denoted as \(a\) and \(b\). Using an example with the function \(y = x^2\) in the first Cartesian quadrant, it explains how to calculate this area from point \(a\) to point \(b\).

The notation for a definite integral includes these bounds: \(\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx\), where \(a\) is placed below and \(b\) above in the notation. The text illustrates using an example with the function \(y = 1 - x^2\), finding the area from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\). By taking the antiderivative of the integrand, the equation becomes:

\[ \text{Area} = \int_{0}^{1} (1 - x^2) \, dx = \left[ x - \frac{1}{3}x^3 \right]_{0}^{1}. \]

Evaluating this at \(x = 1\) and \(x = 0\), the area under the curve from 0 to 1 is calculated as \(\frac{2}{3}\). This result matches what was previously found using the limit of a Riemann sum, demonstrating consistency between different methods for calculating definite integrals. Note that there's no constant of integration (\(+C\)) in definite integrals because the bounds are specified.
