The text introduces the concept of definite integrals by adding interval bounds to integration. A definite integral represents the area under a curve within a specified interval, denoted as "the integral from \(a\) to \(b\)" where \(a\) is the lower bound and \(b\) is the upper bound on the x-axis. The process involves evaluating the antiderivative of the function at these bounds and subtracting the results.

The example provided uses the function \(y = 1 - x^2\) from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\). The definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} (1 - x^2) \, dx\) is calculated by finding the antiderivative: \(x - \frac{1}{3}x^3\), evaluated at the bounds. Substituting the upper and lower limits into this expression and subtracting yields an area of \(\frac{2}{3}\). This matches the result obtained using the limit of a Riemann sum, demonstrating consistency between methods for finding areas under curves with definite integrals. Unlike indefinite integrals, definite integrals do not include a constant \(C\), as they are evaluated over specific intervals.
