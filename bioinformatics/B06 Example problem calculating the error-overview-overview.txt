The text outlines solving and analyzing the differential equation \( y' = 4xy \). By separating variables, integrating, and exponentiating, the general solution is found:

\[ y(x) = e^{2x^2 + C} \]

Using the initial condition \( y(1) = 1 \), the constant \( C \) is determined to be \(-2\), giving the specific solution:

\[ y(x) = e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

The first derivative is calculated as:

\[ y'(x) = 4x e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

For the second derivative, applying the product rule yields:

\[ y''(x) = (16x^2 + 4) e^{2x^2 - 2} \]

To estimate local truncation error with a step size \( h = 0.1 \), \( y''(c) \) is evaluated at its maximum within the interval, specifically at \( x = 1.1 \):

\[ y''(1.1) = (16 \times 1.1^2 + 4) e^{2 \times 1.1^2 - 2} \approx 35.553 \]

The error bound for one numerical step is given by:

\[ \text{Error} = \frac{h^2}{2} \times y''(c) \]

Substituting the values, the estimated maximum error for the first step with \( h = 0.1 \) is approximately 0.1778. The text suggests using methods like Weller's to continue solving while controlling errors.
