The text describes an example of forming a right coset in group theory, specifically within the context of permutations in the symmetric group \( S_4 \). Here's a summary:

1. **Context**: The discussion involves defining a right coset \( HA \) where \( H \) is a subgroup of the symmetric group \( S_4 \), and \( A \) is an element (permutation) from \( S_4 \).

2. **Elements of \( H \)**: 
   - Identity permutation: \( (1, 2, 3, 4) \rightarrow (1, 2, 3, 4) \)
   - Transposition: \( (1, 2) \rightarrow (2, 1), 3 \rightarrow 3, 4 \rightarrow 4 \)
   - Another transposition: \( (3, 4) \rightarrow (4, 3), 1 \rightarrow 1, 2 \rightarrow 2 \)
   - Composition of above two transpositions: \( (1, 2)(3, 4) \)

3. **Element \( A \)**:
   - Permutation: \( (1, 4, 3, 2) \), meaning \( 1 \rightarrow 4, 4 \rightarrow 3, 3 \rightarrow 2, 2 \rightarrow 1 \).

4. **Forming Right Coset \( HA \)**:
   - The right coset is formed by composing each element of \( H \) with \( A \).
   - Composition follows the rule: apply \( A \) first (right), then apply elements from \( H \).

5. **Examples**:
   - Identity composed with \( A \): results in \( A \) itself.
   - Other compositions are calculated step-by-step, showing how each element of \( H \) transforms when combined with \( A \).

6. **Result**: The right coset \( HA \) consists of the permutations obtained from these compositions.

The text encourages readers to work out the right coset for the same subgroup \( H \) and permutation \( A \), reinforcing understanding through practice.
