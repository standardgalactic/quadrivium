The text describes solving an initial value problem involving a first-order linear differential equation. The given equation is \( y' + y = x \) with the initial condition \( y(0) = 4 \). 

To solve it, the author identifies that the standard form of the differential equation allows for using an integrating factor, which in this case is \( e^x \). Multiplying through by this integrating factor transforms the original equation into one where the left side becomes the derivative of \( e^x y \). Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), they find that:

\[ e^x y = \int x e^x \, dx. \]

Using integration by parts, where \( u = x \) and \( dv = e^x \, dx \), the solution becomes:

\[ e^x y = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C_1. \]

Solving for \( y \) gives a family of solutions:

\[ y = x - 1 + \frac{C_1}{e^x}. \]

Applying the initial condition \( y(0) = 4 \), they substitute and solve for \( C_1 \):

\[ 4 = 0 - 1 + C_1 \implies C_1 = 5. \]

Thus, the specific solution to the initial value problem is:

\[ y = x - 1 + \frac{5}{e^x}. \]

This curve represents the particular solution corresponding to the given initial condition.

The text provides a step-by-step solution to an initial value problem involving a first-order linear differential equation. The equation given is \( y' + y = x \), with the initial condition \( y(0) = 4 \).

1. **Standard Form and Integrating Factor**: The equation is already in standard form, where the coefficient of \( y \) is 1. The integrating factor is determined to be \( e^x \).

2. **Multiplying Through by the Integrating Factor**: Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by \( e^x \) transforms it into:
   \[
   e^x y' + e^x y = x e^x
   \]
   This can be rewritten as the derivative of a product:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx}(e^x y) = x e^x
   \]

3. **Integration**: Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   e^x y = \int x e^x \, dx
   \]
   Using integration by parts, where \( u = x \) and \( dv = e^x \, dx \), the integral becomes:
   \[
   \int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C_1
   \]

4. **Solving for \( y \)**: Dividing through by \( e^x \) gives:
   \[
   y = x - 1 + \frac{C_1}{e^x}
   \]
   This represents the family of solutions.

5. **Applying Initial Condition**: Using the initial condition \( y(0) = 4 \):
   \[
   4 = 0 - 1 + C_1
   \]
   Solving for \( C_1 \), we find \( C_1 = 5 \).

6. **Final Solution**: The specific solution to the initial value problem is:
   \[
   y = x - 1 + \frac{5}{e^x}
   \]

This solution corresponds to a particular curve in the family of solutions, highlighted as the "darker" curve in the text's context.
