The text describes solving an initial value problem involving a first-order linear differential equation. The given equation is \( y' + y = x \) with the initial condition \( y(0) = 4 \). 

To solve it, the author identifies that the standard form of the differential equation allows for using an integrating factor, which in this case is \( e^x \). Multiplying through by this integrating factor transforms the original equation into one where the left side becomes the derivative of \( e^x y \). Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), they find that:

\[ e^x y = \int x e^x \, dx. \]

Using integration by parts, where \( u = x \) and \( dv = e^x \, dx \), the solution becomes:

\[ e^x y = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C_1. \]

Solving for \( y \) gives a family of solutions:

\[ y = x - 1 + \frac{C_1}{e^x}. \]

Applying the initial condition \( y(0) = 4 \), they substitute and solve for \( C_1 \):

\[ 4 = 0 - 1 + C_1 \implies C_1 = 5. \]

Thus, the specific solution to the initial value problem is:

\[ y = x - 1 + \frac{5}{e^x}. \]

This curve represents the particular solution corresponding to the given initial condition.
