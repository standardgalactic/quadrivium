The text addresses two problems related to capacitors and dielectric materials:

1. **Problem 1: Determining Dielectric Constant**
   - A capacitor with an initial capacitance of 7.4 pico-farads needs to store \(7.4 \times 10^{-6}\) joules at a potential difference of 652 volts.
   - The energy stored in a capacitor is given by \( u = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \).
   - To find the necessary dielectric constant (\(\kappa\)), use the formula:
     \[
     \kappa = \frac{2 U_{\text{final}}}{C_{\text{initial}} V^2}
     \]
   - This calculation determines the dielectric constant required to achieve the desired energy storage at the specified voltage.

2. **Problem 2: Maximum Plate Area for a Capacitor**
   - A parallel plate capacitor uses a material with a dielectric constant of 2.8 and a dielectric strength of 18 megavolts per meter.
   - The goal is to achieve a capacitance of \(7.0 \times 10^{-8}\) farads while handling a potential difference of 4 kilovolts.
   - The capacitance formula for parallel plates is \( C = \kappa \frac{A}{D} \), where \(A\) is the plate area and \(D\) is the separation between plates.
   - Using \( D = \frac{V}{\text{Dielectric Field Strength}} \), the minimum plate area can be calculated as:
     \[
     A = \frac{C \cdot V}{\kappa \times \text{Dielectric Field Strength}}
     \]
   - This calculation determines the minimum plate area needed to meet the specified capacitance and voltage requirements.

Both problems highlight the interplay between capacitance, dielectric properties, potential difference, and physical dimensions in designing capacitors.
