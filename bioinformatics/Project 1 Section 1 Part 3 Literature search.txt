And here we have our literature search. Now I'm not going to say too much about it. The first
place and the best place probably to start when you're looking for clinically relevant,
medically relevant literature to read, go to PubMed. You see the URL there that you can
copy into your browser and go to PubMed to do a search. Now it's almost like a Google search
when you just type in a keyword diabetes you're going to get back tens of thousands, hundreds of
thousands of results. And to wade through those are quite difficult. PubMed is nice. You can
kind of sort things on the left hand panel. But the best way probably or two of the best ways to get
the most out of PubMed is to use the advanced search or MESH, medical subject heading searches.
Now PubMed is very good. They've got nice YouTube tutorials, two little short videos that you can
watch both on doing an advanced search or doing a medical subject heading search. And you see the
shortened URLs there. Type them into your browser and watch those tutorials if you ever wondered about
doing some good medical literature searches. Once you've done that, once you know what's out there,
remember that is going to go into your protocol. That is going to go into your reference list.
Get some good articles together. Find out what is going on on these topics before you embark on any
type of research. Now in the next section, we'll quickly look at what type of research project this is going to be.
