The text provides definitions and properties for three types of matrices: diagonal, triangular, and symmetric.

1. **Diagonal Matrix (D):**
   - A matrix where all non-diagonal elements are zero.
   - It is invertible only if all diagonal elements are non-zero; otherwise, it becomes singular (non-invertible).
   - Raising a diagonal matrix to any power \( K \) involves raising each diagonal element to the power \( K \), provided none of them are zero. For example, if \( D = \text{diag}(D_1, D_2, D_3) \), then \( D^K = \text{diag}(D_1^K, D_2^K, D_3^K) \).
   - The inverse of a diagonal matrix is another diagonal matrix with each non-zero diagonal element replaced by its reciprocal.

2. **Triangular Matrix:**
   - There are two types: upper and lower triangular matrices.
     - **Upper Triangular:** All elements below the main diagonal are zero. The transpose of an upper triangular matrix is a lower triangular matrix, and vice versa.
     - **Lower Triangular:** All elements above the main diagonal are zero.
   - Multiplying two upper (or two lower) triangular matrices results in another upper (or lower) triangular matrix.
   - A triangular matrix is invertible if all its diagonal elements are non-zero. The inverse of a triangular matrix remains triangular.

3. **Symmetric Matrix:**
   - A square matrix that is equal to its transpose (\( A = A^T \)).
   - If \( A \) and \( B \) are symmetric, then both \( A + B \) and \( A - B \) are symmetric.
   - Multiplying a symmetric matrix by a scalar results in another symmetric matrix.
   - Symmetric matrices have properties that make them useful in various mathematical contexts.

These definitions highlight the special structural characteristics of these matrices, which simplify operations like inversion and exponentiation.
