The text explains "microgravity," a term used by NASA to describe conditions in space, particularly on the International Space Station (ISS). It clarifies that microgravity does not mean zero gravity; rather, both astronauts and objects aboard the ISS experience significant gravitational forces from Earth. However, they feel weightless because the ISS is in continuous freefall around Earth.

This sensation of weightlessness arises due to orbital mechanics: the ISS falls toward Earth but maintains enough tangential velocity to keep orbiting without collision, creating a state of perpetual freefall. The term "microgravity" reflects that gravity's effects are greatly reduced, not absent. Gravity weakens with distance according to Newton's law of universal gravitation, which explains why its pull on the ISS is slightly less than at Earth's surface but still present.

The concept relates to Einsteinâ€™s equivalence principle, where freefall mimics being far from gravitational forces, resulting in near-zero gravity effects due to continuous acceleration. An analogy with a falling elevator illustrates how both objects and their environment accelerate together during freefall, leading to weightlessness.
