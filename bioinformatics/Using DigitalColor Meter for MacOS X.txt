Another good way to choose color is to use a program such as Digital Color Meter as I have here.
This is on an Apple system.
Under programs or applications, I should say, utilities, there is a Digital Color Meter program.
When you launch it, it will look like this.
This and anywhere on screen where your mouse points, it will give you the RGB values of any color.
Therefore, go to a website that you like the design of.
Now, this is by no means a good design.
I think I need to change this very soon.
It's a bit outdated, I should say, but for instance, just look at the colors.
You might like these colors.
You might like the screen.
You point on it and you jot down the RGB values.
You can then go into a program or a website like Kula, Kula.Adobe.com,
and punch in those values for red, green and blue when you do edit your colors.
And you can use an existing website's color design that you like and bring it into your own design.
