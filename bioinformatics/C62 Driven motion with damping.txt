and now we move on to still having our damping force on our oscillatory motion
but now we're also going to introduce some driving force so we are going to
have our system oscillate there's going to be some damping involved but as it
moves we provide an external force on that moving mass on the spring for
instance and we're just going to do that in some form of a function in t so we
start with the equation that we already know we add the f of t we bring it all
over to the left hand side in decreasing order of primes equal f of t I'm going
to divide everything by the mass left with that and again by letting this
damping coefficient divided by m be two lambda so it makes it easy for me to
solve my differential equation still with the spring constant divided by m being
omega squared and then f of t divided by m I'm just going to call this new
function f of t uppercase let's solve a problem in the next video and see how
easy how easy this is
