The video introduces the concept of double integrals as an extension of single integrals. A single integral represents the area under a curve in two dimensions for a function of one variable. In contrast, a double integral calculates the volume beneath a surface defined by a function of two variables.

To illustrate this, the presenter imagines dividing a square region on the x-y plane into smaller squares, each contributing to a tiny volume with its height determined by the surface function \( f(x, y) \). The sum of these small volumes over the entire region gives the total volume under the surface.

The boundaries for integration do not have to be straight lines; they can also be curves. When computing a double integral, one can integrate with respect to \( x \) first and then \( y \), or vice versa. This is demonstrated through an example where both orders of integration yield the same result, confirming Fubini's theorem.

The process involves:
1. Treating one variable as constant while integrating with respect to the other.
2. Completing the inner integral before moving on to the outer integral.

This method ensures that regardless of the order of integration, the final result is consistent, provided the function and region meet certain conditions for Fubini's theorem to apply.
