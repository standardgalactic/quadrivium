The text outlines how to express solutions for systems involving complex eigenvalues of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix:

1. **Complex Exponential Representation**: A complex number \(e^{\alpha t + i\beta t}\) is rewritten as \(e^{\alpha t}(\cos(\beta t) + i\sin(\beta t))\).

2. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**:
   - Eigenvectors may have components involving complex numbers, expressed in terms of real (\(b_1\)) and imaginary (\(b_2\)) parts.

3. **General Solution Form**:
   - For matrices with complex conjugate eigenvalues, solutions are given by:
     - \(x_1 = e^{\alpha t}(b_1 \cos(\beta t) - b_2 \sin(\beta t))\)
     - \(x_2 = e^{\alpha t}(b_1 \sin(\beta t) + b_2 \cos(\beta t))\)

4. **Solution Set**:
   - The complete solution is a linear combination: \(c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2\), where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are constants.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Typically, specific values or further analysis are needed to find particular solutions or interpret them in context.
