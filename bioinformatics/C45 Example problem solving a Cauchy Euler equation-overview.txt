The video presenter outlines a plan to solve a second-order linear differential equation with variable coefficients using two different methods across two videos. Here's a summary of their approach:

1. **Formulation**: The given problem is characterized by non-constant, variable coefficients and is non-homogeneous.

2. **Solution Strategy**:
   - **Complementary Solution (Homogeneous Equation)**: The presenter suggests guessing the form of solutions for the homogeneous part as \( y = x^m \). By substituting this into the differential equation, they derive a characteristic equation:
     \[
     m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0
     \]
     which simplifies to \((m-1)^2 = 0\), resulting in repeated roots \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \).

   - **General Solution for Homogeneous Equation**: The complementary solution is given by:
     \[
     y_c = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x)
     \]
     Here, the Wronskian of \(y_1 = x\) and \(y_2 = x \ln(x)\) is calculated to be \(x\).

3. **Particular Solution (Non-Homogeneous Equation)**:
   - The equation is first converted to standard form by dividing through by \(x^2\), resulting in a non-homogeneous term.
   
   - Using the method of variation of parameters, they calculate \(u_1\) and \(u_2\):
     \[
     u_1 = -\int \frac{y_2 f(x)}{\text{Wronskian}} \, dx
     \]
     \[
     u_2 = \int \frac{y_1 f(x)}{\text{Wronskian}} \, dx
     \]

   - After integration and substitution, they find:
     \[
     u_1 = -\ln(x)^2, \quad u_2 = 2\ln(x)
     \]

4. **General Solution**:
   - The particular solution \(y_p\) is constructed using \(u_1 y_1 + u_2 y_2\):
     \[
     y_p = (-x \ln(x)^2) + (2x \ln(x))
     \]
     Simplifying this yields:
     \[
     y_p = x \ln(x)^2
     \]

5. **Final Solution**: The complete solution to the differential equation is:
   \[
   y = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) + x \ln(x)^2
   \]

The presenter concludes by planning to use a different method in another video, involving substitution \( t = \ln(x) \), to verify or obtain the same solution.
