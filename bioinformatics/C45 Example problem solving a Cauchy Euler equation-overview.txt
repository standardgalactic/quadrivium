The video presenter outlines a plan to solve a second-order linear differential equation with variable coefficients using two different methods across two videos. Here's a summary of their approach:

1. **Formulation**: The given problem is characterized by non-constant, variable coefficients and is non-homogeneous.

2. **Solution Strategy**:
   - **Complementary Solution (Homogeneous Equation)**: The presenter suggests guessing the form of solutions for the homogeneous part as \( y = x^m \). By substituting this into the differential equation, they derive a characteristic equation:
     \[
     m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0
     \]
     which simplifies to \((m-1)^2 = 0\), resulting in repeated roots \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \).

   - **General Solution for Homogeneous Equation**: The complementary solution is given by:
     \[
     y_c = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x)
     \]
     Here, the Wronskian of \(y_1 = x\) and \(y_2 = x \ln(x)\) is calculated to be \(x\).

3. **Particular Solution (Non-Homogeneous Equation)**:
   - The equation is first converted to standard form by dividing through by \(x^2\), resulting in a non-homogeneous term.
   
   - Using the method of variation of parameters, they calculate \(u_1\) and \(u_2\):
     \[
     u_1 = -\int \frac{y_2 f(x)}{\text{Wronskian}} \, dx
     \]
     \[
     u_2 = \int \frac{y_1 f(x)}{\text{Wronskian}} \, dx
     \]

   - After integration and substitution, they find:
     \[
     u_1 = -\ln(x)^2, \quad u_2 = 2\ln(x)
     \]

4. **General Solution**:
   - The particular solution \(y_p\) is constructed using \(u_1 y_1 + u_2 y_2\):
     \[
     y_p = (-x \ln(x)^2) + (2x \ln(x))
     \]
     Simplifying this yields:
     \[
     y_p = x \ln(x)^2
     \]

5. **Final Solution**: The complete solution to the differential equation is:
   \[
   y = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) + x \ln(x)^2
   \]

The presenter concludes by planning to use a different method in another video, involving substitution \( t = \ln(x) \), to verify or obtain the same solution.

The video presents a plan to solve a differential equation using two methods across multiple videos. The equation is characterized as linear, second-order, with non-constant variable coefficients, and it's non-homogeneous.

1. **Method 1: Power Series Solution**
   - Assumes solutions of the form \( y = x^m \).
   - Derives that for the complementary solution (homogeneous part), the characteristic equation is \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \) with roots \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \).
   - This results in a complementary solution of \( y_c = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) \).
   - The Wronskian for this solution is computed as \( x \), confirming linear independence.
   - For the particular solution, the equation is put into standard form by dividing through by \( x^2 \).
   - Integrals involving the function \( f(x) = 2/x \) are calculated using variation of parameters:
     - \( u_1 \) involves integrating \(-\int (x \ln(x) \cdot \frac{2}{x}) / x \, dx = -\int \frac{2 \ln(x)}{x} \, dx \), resulting in \(-(\ln(x))^2\).
     - \( u_2 \) involves integrating \(\int (x \cdot \frac{2}{x}) / x \, dx = 2 \int \frac{1}{x} \, dx\), resulting in \(2 \ln(x)\).
   - The particular solution is found as \( y_p = u_1 y_1 + u_2 y_2 = -x (\ln(x))^2 + 2x \ln(x) \).
   - Combining with the complementary solution gives \( y = c_1 x + c_2 x \ln(x) + x (\ln(x))^2 \).

2. **Plan for Method 2: Substitution**
   - The presenter plans to use a substitution method where \( t = \ln(x) \) in a subsequent video.
   - This method aims to verify the results obtained by the first method.

The solution strategy involves solving both the homogeneous and non-homogeneous parts of the differential equation, using mathematical techniques such as power series assumptions, variation of parameters, and potential substitution methods. The final expression for \( y \) includes constants of integration and terms involving natural logarithms.
