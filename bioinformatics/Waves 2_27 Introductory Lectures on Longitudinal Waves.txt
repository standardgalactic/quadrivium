Here we have a lovely Doppler effect problem.
We measure the sound through air in our experiment to be 340 meters per second.
And in our experiment we have a wall on one side, an observer on the other side,
and here we have a tuning fork.
It has a frequency of 400 hertz,
and it is traveling away from the observer towards the wall at 2 meters per second.
Firstly, we want to know what is the apparent frequency that the observer hears
from the sound that comes directly from the tuning forks.
In other words, not the reflected sound from the wall, but directly from there.
So we draw a unit vector, so we're just looking at direction,
from observer to source, so it's going to be a new in that direction.
Okay, so let's look.
Frequency, the apparent of the observer equals frequency of the source.
Now velocity, now is it going to be positive or negative?
Well, this unit vector is in this direction.
The tuning fork moves in the same direction,
so that is going to be plus the V source.
And velocity, this velocity of the observer,
we're looking at the observer, sorry.
Silly, silly mistake, we don't do that.
Observer is an enumerator.
Okay, it is standing still, so there's no movement.
And at the bottom, we're going to have plus 2 meters per second,
in as much as the direction or velocity of the source
is in the same direction as our unit vector there.
So we're going to see a slightly lower frequency,
which is what we want,
because they're looking away from each other.
As the train passes you by with higher frequency,
you'll have lower frequency on that side.
So that works for us.
Now what is the frequency of, let's work that out.
So that's going to be 340 divided by 342 times 340.
I think I got 398 hertz.
398 hertz.
And if we then look at the reflected wave,
what is going to happen now?
So we're still going to have the frequency of the source
times the velocity.
Now again, the observer,
the observer is standing still,
but which now is the observer?
Now, the frequency of the waves that bounce off here
is going to be the same as the ones that come in,
or the ones that bounce off.
So he's not the observer anymore.
The wall is now the observer.
And I've got to draw a unit vector
in the direction of observer to source.
And my observer is again standing still,
so this will be plus zero.
Now what happens here?
My source is traveling in the opposite direction
to this unit vector,
so that is going to be minus 2 meters per second.
Okay, so he's not in the equation anymore,
although he's going to hear this reflective sound.
But now this becomes, remember this,
obviously, the reason that becomes the observer.
So that's going to be 340 divided by 342.
And I, 398, 4 in 2.
That's going to be 4 in 2 hertz.
4 in 2 hertz.
So the difference in frequency is going to be 4 hertz.
And I think that's the next question.
Let's see.
Now I think that was 397.7.
Let's just be accurate.
397.7.
And this was, that one was, let me see, 402.4.
402.4 hertz.
Okay, a bit more accuracy,
because the last part asks what is the number of beats per second.
And remember, the number of beats per second
is the difference in frequency.
So it's going to be this minus that,
which is going to be about 4.7.
4.7 beats per minute.
So generally, you want to write beats per minute.
But certainly, that is going to be,
4.7 is going to be,
that's not per minute, is it?
That's the beats.
Beats.
Okay.
It's just the difference.
So that's going to be per second.
Because that is,
hertz is inverse seconds, inverse seconds.
So the beats per second
is the difference between the two frequencies.
Okay.
This is the problem,
just to make sure that you can think logically.
It's stuck open window with all the outside sounds.
Well, it's just for that.
So I have source 1 and source 2,
the observer there.
And I want to know for what values of L1,
the length here,
minus L2,
while the wave patterns there fall on to each other
so that the sound brain is in phase.
So we get a superposition of waves there
with interference there
that you get twice the amplitude.
Now, if S1 was on top of S2,
L1 would be equal to L2.
So then we know
that the two weight lengths
will be exactly,
will exactly coincide.
So we can get maximum
interference there.
So if L1 equals L2
equals L2,
so L1 minus L2
is going to be 0.
So that's 1,
certainly.
But I think we're more interested in L1
being more than L2.
Well,
if you have the two waves of three,
if we look at the waves
as transverse waves,
they will interfere
if both of them fall
on top of each other.
So I've got to move
exactly one wavelength
longer than the other one
so that we do get
this constructive interference.
So L2 minus L1,
L1 minus L2,
so is this going to equal
the wavelength?
If I add another wavelength there,
the two will coincide
once again.
And if I move
in another wavelength
long,
that's two wavelengths,
so this is just going to be
n where n is an integer.
So just an integer
times the wavelength
and the difference
between L2 and L1
will give us
constructive interference
at the observer.
