The lecture covers performing derivatives using SymPy in Python within a notebook environment. Key steps include:

1. **Symbol Initialization**: Variables \( A \), \( B \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) are defined as symbols with `sym.Symbol`.

2. **Defining Expressions**: An expression \( f = \sin(XZ) + \cos(XY) \) is created for derivative computations.

3. **Derivatives**:
   - **First Derivative**: The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( X \) is computed using `SYM.D(f, X)`.
   - **Second Derivative**: Achieved by chaining differentiation or using syntax like `X, 2`.

4. **Higher-Order Partial Derivatives**: For an expression \( F = \sin(XY) + \cos(XZ) \), higher-order partial derivatives are computed by specifying orders for each variable.

5. **Using `diff` Function**: The `diff` function is recommended for computing derivatives, allowing direct specification of variables and order (e.g., `f.diff(X)`).

The session provides a foundational understanding of symbolic differentiation with SymPy, covering both basic and complex derivative computations.

The lecture covers how to perform symbolic differentiation using the SymPy library in Python. It outlines setting up a notebook environment with SymPy for better visualization through prettyprinting. The key topics discussed include:

1. **Symbol Initialization**: Variables such as \( A \), \( B \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) are defined as symbols using `sym.Symbol`.

2. **Defining Expressions**: An expression involving trigonometric functions, \( f = \sin(XZ) + \cos(XY) \), is set up for derivative computation.

3. **Derivatives**:
   - **First Derivative**: The first partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( X \) is computed using `SYM.D(f, X)`.
   - **Second Derivative**: The second derivative with respect to \( X \) can be calculated either by repeating the differentiation or using syntax like `(X, 2)`.

4. **Higher-Order Partial Derivatives**: Demonstrates computing higher-order partial derivatives for an expression \( F = \sin(XY) + \cos(XZ) \), specifying orders for each variable (e.g., once with respect to \( X \), three times with respect to \( Y \), and twice with respect to \( Z \)).

5. **Using `diff` Function**: The `diff` function is emphasized as the preferred method for computing derivatives, allowing specification of variables and order directly within its parameters (e.g., `f.diff(X)`). This facilitates efficient computation of higher-order derivatives.

Overall, the session provides a foundational understanding of symbolic differentiation with SymPy, covering both basic and advanced derivative computations.
