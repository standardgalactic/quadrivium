Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder first identified in 1835 by Robert Graves, primarily causing hyperthyroidism with potential symptoms including an enlarged thyroid gland, eye problems (ophthalmopathy), and skin issues (dermopathy). However, these symptoms are not present in all patients. Typically diagnosed between ages 20 to 40, it more commonly affects women.

The disorder results from a loss of self-tolerance to thyroid antigens, particularly the TSH receptor, leading antibodies can either stimulate or inhibit thyroid activity, resulting in hyperthyroidism and sometimes hypothyroid episodes.

Research involves studying orbital pre-adipocyte fibroblasts expressing TSH receptors affected by these antibodies. Insights have been primarily derived from animal studies using mice injected with TSH receptor antigens to replicate symptoms. While early models had limitations, advances like gene delivery methods and engineered mouse models have enhanced understanding.

Current research aims to simulate chronic thyroid stimulation through techniques such as T-cell depletion followed by adenoviral vector immunization, seeking to closely model human conditions. This ongoing work aids in understanding the complex manifestations of Graves' disease. The next video will delve into its clinical symptoms and signs.
