The text explains how to find the indefinite integral of \(\tan(x)\) using substitution and logarithmic properties. It begins by expressing \(\int \tan(x) \, dx\) as \(\int \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \, dx\). Using \(u\)-substitution with \(u = \cos(x)\), we find \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\), allowing us to rewrite the integral in terms of \(u\):

\[
\int \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \, dx = \int \frac{-1}{u} \, du
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
- \ln |u| + C
\]

Substituting back for \(u\), we get:

\[
-\ln |\cos(x)| + C
\]

Using properties of logarithms, this can be expressed as:

\[
\ln |\sec(x)| + C
\]

The text also notes that recognizing the form \(\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\) allows for a direct application of the natural log rule to find the integral more quickly. Additionally, it provides an example with \(\int \cot(x) \, dx\), resulting in:

\[
- \ln |\csc(x)| + C
\] 

This demonstrates how these techniques can be applied to similar integrals.
