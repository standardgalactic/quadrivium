Pythagoras noted that for a right triangle the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of each of the other two sides.
You can clearly see this from the diagram shown here.
Each small square in each of the three larger squares is the same size.
This is larger square 1, larger square 2 and larger square 3.
There are 9 small squares in square 1 and 16 small squares in square 2.
That would represent 3 squared and 4 squared.
The total surface area of squares 1 and 2 would thus be 25 squares.
Square 3 also counts 25 squares.
Thus, the surface area of square 3, which represents 5 squared,
is equal to the surface area of the sum of squares 1 and 2.
If the sides were labelled x and y and the hypotenuse labelled h,
then h squared equals x squared plus y squared.
The Pythagorean theorem.
