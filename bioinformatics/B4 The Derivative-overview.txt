The text provides an overview of derivative rules often used in biomathematics, specifically focusing on the product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.

1. **Product Rule**: 
   - When two functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are multiplied together to form a new function \( y = f(x) \cdot g(x) \), their derivative is given by:
     \[
     y' = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)
     \]
   - This can be remembered as the derivative of the first function times the second plus the first function times the derivative of the second.

2. **Quotient Rule**:
   - When one function is divided by another, forming \( y = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \), the derivative is calculated using:
     \[
     y' = \frac{f'(x) \cdot g(x) - f(x) \cdot g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}
     \]
   - This rule emphasizes that the denominator cannot be zero. The derivative of the numerator is multiplied by the entire denominator, subtracted by the product of the original numerator and the derivative of the denominator, all divided by the square of the denominator.

3. **Chain Rule**:
   - Used when a function is composed of another function, such as \( y = \sin(x^3) \).
   - If \( u = x^3 \), then \( y = \sin(u) \). The derivative \( y' \) is found by taking the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function and multiplying it by the derivative of the inner function:
     \[
     y' = \cos(x^3) \cdot 3x^2
     \]
   - This involves differentiating the outer function first, then multiplying by the derivative of the inner function.

These rules are essential for understanding how to differentiate composite functions, products, and quotients in biomathematics.
