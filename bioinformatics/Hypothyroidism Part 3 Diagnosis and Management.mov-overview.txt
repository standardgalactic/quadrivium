The text provides an overview of diagnosing and managing hypothyroidism. Diagnosis primarily relies on clinical evaluation and laboratory tests, focusing on thyroxine (T4), T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Sintigraphy and sonography are less significant compared to their use in hyperthyroidism.

Key diagnostic points include:
- Primary hypothyroidism presents with elevated TSH and low thyroid hormone levels.
- Central hypothyroidism involves inappropriately low TSH for the decreased thyroid hormones, requiring further hypothalamic-pituitary evaluation and MRI scans.

Specific clinical scenarios are highlighted:
1. Non-compliance in patients on thyroxine replacement therapy can lead to misleading lab results; honesty from the patient is crucial.
2. Patients recovering from severe illness may exhibit abnormal thyroid function tests (TFTs) without needing medication, as normalization typically occurs over time.

For diagnosis involving thyroid antibodies, further resources are suggested. Most hypothyroid patients require lifelong hormone replacement and monitoring unless their condition is transient or drug-induced.

Therapy aims to achieve a euthyroid state:
- Initial thyroxine dosage is generally 6 mcg/kg/day, with lower starting doses for elderly patients or those with coronary artery disease.
- Thyroxine absorption is optimal on an empty stomach; food can reduce it by about 40%.
- Various medications may interfere with thyroxine's absorption and blood levels, necessitating dose adjustments.
- Monitoring TSH levels every 4-6 weeks during initial treatment helps maintain them within the lower normal range.

Potential side effects include allergic reactions to manufacturing compounds and serious consequences from over-replacement. Combination therapy of T3 with thyroxine shows no significant benefits over monotherapy based on current studies, though ongoing research is examining this further.

The text discusses the diagnosis, management, and considerations for treating hypothyroidism:

1. **Diagnosis**:
   - Based on clinical symptoms and lab tests; key markers are thyroxine (T4), T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.
   - Primary hypothyroidism shows elevated TSH and low thyroid hormones.
   - Central hypothyroidism presents with inappropriately low TSH for decreased thyroid hormones, necessitating a hypothalamic-pituitary axis evaluation.

2. **Specific Considerations**:
   - Non-compliance with thyroxine replacement can lead to misleading lab results; patients should be honest about medication adherence.
   - Patients recovering from severe illness may show abnormal thyroid function tests (TFTs) temporarily, often not requiring intervention.

3. **Treatment and Monitoring**:
   - Most hypothyroid patients need lifelong hormone replacement therapy.
   - The goal is a euthyroid state achieved through clinical assessment and lab monitoring.
   - TSH levels guide dosage adjustments, typically aiming to keep them at the lower end of normal.
   - Initial dosing considerations include patient age and comorbidities like coronary artery disease.

4. **Absorption and Interactions**:
   - Thyroxine should be taken on an empty stomach for optimal absorption.
   - Certain medications can affect thyroxine levels; dosage may need adjustment accordingly.

5. **Formulations and Side Effects**:
   - Switching manufacturers requires TSH monitoring due to formulation differences.
   - Over-replacement is a concern, as it can lead to low TSH levels and potential side effects.
   - Combination therapy with T3 shows no significant advantage over monotherapy in current studies.
