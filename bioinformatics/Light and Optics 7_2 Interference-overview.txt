The video explains the relationship between light's frequency, wavelength, and velocity in different mediums, focusing on how refractive index affects these properties. Here's a summary:

1. **Frequency Constancy**: The frequency of light remains constant when transitioning from one medium to another.

2. **Wavelength and Refractive Index**:
   - The relationship between the wavelength of light in a vacuum (\(\lambda\)) and its wavelength in a medium with refractive index \(n\) is given by \(\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda}{n}\).
   - This means that as light enters a medium with a higher refractive index, its wavelength decreases.

3. **Velocity Relationship**:
   - The velocity of light in a vacuum (\(c\)) relates to the velocity in a medium (\(v\)) through the refractive index: \(n = \frac{c}{v}\).
   - Consequently, when light enters a medium with a higher refractive index, its speed decreases.

4. **Frequency and Velocity**:
   - Since frequency remains constant, any change in velocity results in a proportional change in wavelength (\(v = f\lambda\)).

5. **Snell's Law Context**:
   - When discussing refraction at an interface between two media with different refractive indices \(n_1\) and \(n_2\), the incident angle is larger than the refracted angle if \(n_1 < n_2\).
   - The wavelength and velocity are inversely related to the refractive index, meaning a higher refractive index results in a shorter wavelength and slower speed.

6. **Phase Difference**:
   - When light travels through different mediums with varying refractive indices, phase differences can occur.
   - These phase differences affect interference patterns; complete constructive or destructive interference depends on whether the waves are in phase or out of phase upon exiting the mediums.

The video uses these principles to discuss how light behaves at interfaces and how its properties change depending on the medium it travels through.

The text provides an explanation of how to calculate the number of wavelengths fitting within a given length \( L \) and determine the phase difference between two waves traveling through different media.

1. **Wavelength in Length \( L \):**  
   - The wavelength is defined as one-third of \( L \), so there are three wavelengths per unit length \( L \).

2. **Calculating Number of Wavelengths:**  
   - To find the number of wavelengths fitting inside \( L \), divide \( L \) by the wavelength (\( \lambda \)), resulting in 3.

3. **Wavelength in Different Media:**  
   - In a medium with refractive index \( N \), the wavelength is given by \( \lambda/N \). Thus, for two indices \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \), wavelengths are \( \lambda/N_1 \) and \( \lambda/N_2 \).

4. **Phase Difference Calculation:**  
   - The difference in number of waves per length \( L \) is given by \( (N_2 - N_1) \times (L/\lambda) \).
   - This phase difference, expressed in radians, can be calculated since a full wavelength corresponds to \( 2\pi \) radians.

5. **Example Illustration:**  
   - Consider waves traveling through air (\( N_1 = 1 \)) and plastic (\( N_2 = 1.600 \)), with vacuum wavelength \( \lambda = 550 \) nm, and plastic width \( L = 2.6 \) µm.
   - The phase difference is calculated as \( (L/\lambda) \times (N_2 - N_1) = (2.6 \text{ µm} / 0.55 \text{ µm}) \times 0.6 \approx 2.836 \), indicating approximately 2.836 wavelengths fit in the difference.

The explanation connects wavelength calculations to phase differences, using refractive indices and wave properties.

The text discusses the concept of wavelengths and their units. A wavelength is measured in meters, but when describing multiple wavelengths (e.g., 2.836 wavelengths), only the fractional part (.836) affects calculations like phase differences. The discussion centers on sinusoidal waves repeating every 360 degrees or \(2\pi\) radians. When considering a phase difference between two such waves with identical frequency, wavelength, and amplitude, the integer number of complete wavelengths cancels out, leaving only the fraction to determine the actual phase shift. In this example, a phase difference of approximately 300 degrees results from the fractional part (0.836) of the wavelength count.
