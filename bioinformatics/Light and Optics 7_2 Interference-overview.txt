The video explains the relationship between light's frequency, wavelength, and velocity in different mediums, focusing on how refractive index affects these properties. Here's a summary:

1. **Frequency Constancy**: The frequency of light remains constant when transitioning from one medium to another.

2. **Wavelength and Refractive Index**:
   - The relationship between the wavelength of light in a vacuum (\(\lambda\)) and its wavelength in a medium with refractive index \(n\) is given by \(\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda}{n}\).
   - This means that as light enters a medium with a higher refractive index, its wavelength decreases.

3. **Velocity Relationship**:
   - The velocity of light in a vacuum (\(c\)) relates to the velocity in a medium (\(v\)) through the refractive index: \(n = \frac{c}{v}\).
   - Consequently, when light enters a medium with a higher refractive index, its speed decreases.

4. **Frequency and Velocity**:
   - Since frequency remains constant, any change in velocity results in a proportional change in wavelength (\(v = f\lambda\)).

5. **Snell's Law Context**:
   - When discussing refraction at an interface between two media with different refractive indices \(n_1\) and \(n_2\), the incident angle is larger than the refracted angle if \(n_1 < n_2\).
   - The wavelength and velocity are inversely related to the refractive index, meaning a higher refractive index results in a shorter wavelength and slower speed.

6. **Phase Difference**:
   - When light travels through different mediums with varying refractive indices, phase differences can occur.
   - These phase differences affect interference patterns; complete constructive or destructive interference depends on whether the waves are in phase or out of phase upon exiting the mediums.

The video uses these principles to discuss how light behaves at interfaces and how its properties change depending on the medium it travels through.

The text provides an explanation of how to calculate the number of wavelengths fitting within a given length \( L \) and determine the phase difference between two waves traveling through different media.

1. **Wavelength in Length \( L \):**  
   - The wavelength is defined as one-third of \( L \), so there are three wavelengths per unit length \( L \).

2. **Calculating Number of Wavelengths:**  
   - To find the number of wavelengths fitting inside \( L \), divide \( L \) by the wavelength (\( \lambda \)), resulting in 3.

3. **Wavelength in Different Media:**  
   - In a medium with refractive index \( N \), the wavelength is given by \( \lambda/N \). Thus, for two indices \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \), wavelengths are \( \lambda/N_1 \) and \( \lambda/N_2 \).

4. **Phase Difference Calculation:**  
   - The difference in number of waves per length \( L \) is given by \( (N_2 - N_1) \times (L/\lambda) \).
   - This phase difference, expressed in radians, can be calculated since a full wavelength corresponds to \( 2\pi \) radians.

5. **Example Illustration:**  
   - Consider waves traveling through air (\( N_1 = 1 \)) and plastic (\( N_2 = 1.600 \)), with vacuum wavelength \( \lambda = 550 \) nm, and plastic width \( L = 2.6 \) µm.
   - The phase difference is calculated as \( (L/\lambda) \times (N_2 - N_1) = (2.6 \text{ µm} / 0.55 \text{ µm}) \times 0.6 \approx 2.836 \), indicating approximately 2.836 wavelengths fit in the difference.

The explanation connects wavelength calculations to phase differences, using refractive indices and wave properties.

The text discusses the concept of wavelengths and their units. A wavelength is measured in meters, but when describing multiple wavelengths (e.g., 2.836 wavelengths), only the fractional part (.836) affects calculations like phase differences. The discussion centers on sinusoidal waves repeating every 360 degrees or \(2\pi\) radians. When considering a phase difference between two such waves with identical frequency, wavelength, and amplitude, the integer number of complete wavelengths cancels out, leaving only the fraction to determine the actual phase shift. In this example, a phase difference of approximately 300 degrees results from the fractional part (0.836) of the wavelength count.

The video explains the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and velocity of light as it transitions from a vacuum into a medium with refractive index \( n \). The key points are:

1. **Frequency Consistency**: The frequency of light remains unchanged when transitioning from one medium to another.

2. **Wavelength Relationship**: In a medium with refractive index \( n \), the wavelength (\( \lambda_n \)) is shorter than in a vacuum, described by the equation:
   \[
   \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda}{n}
   \]
   where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength in a vacuum.

3. **Velocity and Refractive Index**: The velocity of light (\( v \)) in a medium is related to its refractive index by:
   \[
   n = \frac{c}{v}
   \]
   where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

4. **Equation Derivation**:
   - Starting with the relationship between velocity and wavelength: 
     \[
     v = f\lambda
     \]
     where \( f \) is frequency.
   - In a medium, replace \( v \) with \( \frac{c}{n} \) and \( \lambda \) with \( \frac{\lambda}{n} \):
     \[
     f_n = \frac{c/n}{\lambda/n} = \frac{c}{\lambda}
     \]
   - This shows that the frequency remains constant, while velocity decreases by a factor of \( n \), and wavelength shortens by the same factor.

5. **Snell's Law Context**: The discussion connects these concepts with Snell’s law, indicating how angles and velocities change when light enters a medium with different refractive indices (\( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \)). If \( n_2 > n_1 \), the velocity decreases and the wavelength shortens.

6. **Phase Changes and Interference**: When light travels through two media with differing refractive indices, phase differences can occur upon exiting, potentially leading to constructive or destructive interference. This is crucial for understanding phenomena like thin-film interference.

Overall, the video emphasizes that while frequency remains constant across mediums, changes in velocity and wavelength are governed by the medium's refractive index, affecting how light behaves as it transitions between different materials.

The text explains how to calculate the number of wavelengths that fit within a given length \( L \) and how this relates to phase differences in waves traveling through different media.

1. **Wavelength Calculation**: The wavelength \( \lambda \) is described as one-third of the length \( L \). Therefore, the number of wavelengths per length \( L \) is 3 (since \( L / \lambda = 3 \)).

2. **Phase Difference**: To find the phase difference when waves travel through media with different refractive indices (\( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \)), we use:
   - \( \lambda_N = \frac{\lambda}{N} \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength in a vacuum.
   - The difference in the number of wavelengths over length \( L \) is given by \( N_2 - N_1 \).
   - This phase difference can be expressed in radians, with one full wavelength corresponding to \( 2\pi \) radians.

3. **Example**: For an example where a wave travels through air (\( N_1 = 1 \)) and plastic (\( N_2 = 1.600 \)), with the vacuum wavelength \( \lambda = 550 \) nanometers and plastic width of \( 2.6 \) micrometers:
   - Calculate \( L / \lambda \times (N_2 - N_1) \), which results in approximately 2.836 wavelengths fitting into the given length.

The text illustrates these calculations with a practical example, demonstrating how phase differences can be determined based on refractive indices and physical dimensions.

The text discusses how wavelengths, typically measured in meters, can be considered unitless when referring to their count (e.g., "2.836 wavelengths"). A wavelength corresponds to one complete cycle of a sine or cosine wave and repeats every 360 degrees or \(2\pi\) radians. When expressing phase differences between waves, only the fractional part of a wavelength matters; in this case, 0.836 out of a full wavelength is significant.

The text explains that multiplying wavelengths by their angular equivalent (360 degrees or \(2\pi\) radians) allows you to calculate phase difference without explicitly referencing the unit of wavelength, as these units cancel out. The integer part of the wavelength count doesn't affect the phase difference; thus, only 0.836 wavelengths contribute to it.

For waves with identical frequency, wavelength, and amplitude but differing by a phase, this fractional part results in a phase difference of approximately 300 degrees when converted from radians or degrees associated with that fraction of a wavelength cycle. This means two otherwise identical waves can be out of phase by 300 degrees.
