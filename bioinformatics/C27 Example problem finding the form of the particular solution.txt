Again with this problem, let's try to get to the form of the particular solution.
We've got to realize, always look at its non-homogeneous, higher order, linear, ordinary differential equation, constant coefficients.
We're going to use the annihilator approach.
First of all, as far as the auxiliary equation is concerned,
so we're going to have m to the power 3 minus 4m squared plus 4m.
All of that equals 0 as far as the auxiliary equation.
By setting this right-hand side to 0, making it a homogeneous equation,
we can take out an m and we'll have m squared minus 4m plus 4 equaling 0.
That'll be m and it looks like it'll be m minus 2 squared equals 0.
So I'm going to have m sub 1 equals 0 and I'm going to have m sub 2 equaling m sub 3 and that equaling 2.
So my complementary solution is going to be c sub 1 e to the power 0x.
So that's this one, c sub 2 e to the power 2x and c sub 3 x e to the power 2x.
I've got to increase that because they're both the same.
So I know these have got to be taken out.
Now I've got to look for my annihilator differential operator.
How are we going to do that?
Well, it looks like they're different equations here.
I think if I put those together I'm going to get some polynomial
and I'll get an annihilator operator for that.
These two, I suppose, you can't put x to the power 0 on this one
because I have two different alpha values here, so that's never going to work out for me.
So I'll have to make these into separate ones.
That'll be an L2 and that'll be an L3.
Remembering my annihilator differential operators is going to be the product of those three.
As far as polynomials go, just remember that it's going to be d to the power n.
So L1 is going to be in that form.
L2 is going to be in what form?
Well, that's going to be in the form of d minus alpha to the power n.
And then as far as this one, as L3 is concerned, I suppose I can put in an x to the power 0 here.
So that is also going to be in the form d minus alpha to the power n.
So as far as L1 is concerned, let's just have a look.
What is going to happen to L1?
What is n?
Well, the highest order there is 2, but that represents n minus 1, that highest one.
So that equals 2.
In other words, n equals 3.
So as far as L1 is concerned, it's just going to be d to the power 3.
As far as, I don't know if you can see with all the sun shining, L2 is going to be, what is alpha?
Well, alpha here, my alpha value is, try and shield it a bit.
My alpha value is 2.
And my n sub 1, n minus 1, there's also 2.
So n is going to equal 3.
So I'm going to have d minus 2 to the power 3.
And as far as my L3 is concerned, my alpha now is 5.
My n minus 1 equals 0.
In other words, n equals 1.
So I'm going to have d minus 5 to the power 1.
So my annihilator operator in the end is going to be d3, d minus 2 cubed, and d minus 5.
And I've got to multiply that by rewriting this.
Remember, I can rewrite the left hand side as d to the power 3 minus 4d squared plus 4d of y.
Now, I've got, if I apply this differential operator to this side, they'll leave me 0.
And if I apply it to this side, I'm going to have the following fact.
I'm going to have a d3, d cubed, d minus 2 also cubed, and a d minus 5.
I can take another d out from here and be left again with d minus 2 squared.
So, y is going to equal 0.
Now, how do I do this?
Because this was exactly the same as this auxiliary equation.
And I took a d out and I was left with that, which then factored into that.
So, I did that all in one step.
So, if you don't see that, just pause the video and just work this out for yourself.
Factor it all the way down.
And it's good to factor it out because now it's an auxiliary equation in differential form.
And I can just write the auxiliary equation, which is going to be m cubed, and then m minus 2 cubed,
and then m minus 5, and another m, and then m minus 2 cubed equals 0.
So, how many m's am I going to have?
I'm going to have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
So, I better have 10 m values.
It's quite easy to see.
This m, these 3, and that one, that's going to all equal 0.
So, I'm going to have m sub 1 equals m sub 2 equals m sub 3 equals m sub 4 equaling 0.
There's 1, 2, 3, 4 of them is going to equal 0.
Then I'm going to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of them.
5 of them has got to equal 2.
So, there's m sub 5 equals m sub 6 equals m sub 7 equals m sub 8 equals m sub 9 and they equal 2.
And lastly, I'm going to have an m sub 10 and that's going to equal 5.
So, I'm squeezing things in there.
So, as far as my y is concerned, for all these zeros, I'm going to have a c sub 1, c sub 1 x, c sub 2, c sub 3, x squared and c sub 4 x cubed.
So, I've got to grow my x values.
e to the power 0 x is just 1.
So, that's going to be there.
Now, c sub 5, I have a 2 there.
So, it's going to be e to the power 2 x.
Now, I've got to grow it.
e to the power, not e, I have to grow my x values here.
So, that's going to be x e to the power 2 x plus c sub 7 x squared e to the power 2 x plus c sub 8 x cubed e to the power 2 x plus c sub 9 x to the power 4 e to the power 2 x.
Finally, c sub 10 e to the power 5 x.
Okay, pause the video and you can work out all these, all these m's have got to have their corresponding c sub whatever.
Now, let's have a look.
Which ones of all of these are in there?
Well, c1 is in there.
c sub 2 e to the power 2 x.
There it is.
Just a different constant.
Let's not concern us.
These two are just constant multiples of each other.
If I divide these two by each other, I'm just left with a constant.
And x e to the power x, that one is also there.
So, all these others are going to appear in my particular solution.
And I'm going to use a, b and c.
So, it's going to be a x plus b, sorry, b x squared plus c x cubed plus we don't use d e.
x squared e to the power 2 x for that one plus f x cubed e to the power 2 x plus g x to the power 4 e to the power 2 x plus h e to the power 5 x.
Which I now will have to differentiate three times.
So, as to substitute it back in there and then get my answer.
Which will be a very long problem indeed.
But, you guys know, this one might look proper for all or two will be like, ok?
But I will explain the point.
Because of course the grammar.
The grammar.
And the���amen are working through to get the rest of our perspective.
So, a simple lesson we can ability to trim this one, but don't even later.
