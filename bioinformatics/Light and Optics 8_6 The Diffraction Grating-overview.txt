The text describes three distinct problems involving diffraction gratings and monochromatic light:

1. **Determining Lines per Centimeter on a Diffraction Grating:**
   - Monochromatic light with a wavelength of 495 nm is used, observed through a spectroscope to have a second-order maximum at an angle of 9.79 degrees.
   - Using the diffraction grating equation \( m \sin(\theta) = \frac{m \lambda}{d} \), where \( m = 2 \), \( \lambda = 495 \times 10^{-9} \) meters, and \( \theta = 9.79^\circ \), one can solve for the grating spacing \( d \).
   - After finding \( d \), it is converted to lines per meter by taking its reciprocal, then adjusted to lines per centimeter.
   - The result is approximately \( 1.72 \times 10^3 \) lines per centimeter.

2. **Effect of Heating on Diffraction Angle:**
   - A diffraction grating with spacing \( d = 1.25 \times 10^{-5} \) meters and using light at a wavelength of 656 nm is heated, causing it to expand.
   - The change in the angle for the 7th order maximum is calculated considering thermal expansion.
   - Using the linear expansion formula \(\Delta L = \alpha L \Delta T\), where \( \alpha = 1.30 \times 10^{-4} \) per Kelvin and \(\Delta T = 100\) K, the new grating spacing \( d_2 \) is determined.
   - The angle change (\(\Delta \theta\)) is found by recalculating the diffraction equation with the expanded grating. The result indicates a decrease in the angle due to increased grating spacing.

3. **Identifying Wavelengths Producing a Bright Fringe:**
   - A mixture of light ranging from 410 nm to 660 nm is used, and the grating has 2850 lines per centimeter.
   - A bright fringe at 30 degrees is observed.
   - Using the equation \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{m \lambda}{d} \), where \( d = \frac{1}{28500} \) meters, one calculates possible wavelengths for different orders (\( m \)).
   - The calculations show that the 3rd and 4th order maxima produce bright fringes at 30 degrees corresponding to wavelengths of approximately 585 nm and 459 nm, respectively.
   - These wavelengths are within the given range (410-660 nm) and thus produce observable bright fringes.
