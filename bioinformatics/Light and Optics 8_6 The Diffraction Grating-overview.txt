The text describes three distinct problems involving diffraction gratings and monochromatic light:

1. **Determining Lines per Centimeter on a Diffraction Grating:**
   - Monochromatic light with a wavelength of 495 nm is used, observed through a spectroscope to have a second-order maximum at an angle of 9.79 degrees.
   - Using the diffraction grating equation \( m \sin(\theta) = \frac{m \lambda}{d} \), where \( m = 2 \), \( \lambda = 495 \times 10^{-9} \) meters, and \( \theta = 9.79^\circ \), one can solve for the grating spacing \( d \).
   - After finding \( d \), it is converted to lines per meter by taking its reciprocal, then adjusted to lines per centimeter.
   - The result is approximately \( 1.72 \times 10^3 \) lines per centimeter.

2. **Effect of Heating on Diffraction Angle:**
   - A diffraction grating with spacing \( d = 1.25 \times 10^{-5} \) meters and using light at a wavelength of 656 nm is heated, causing it to expand.
   - The change in the angle for the 7th order maximum is calculated considering thermal expansion.
   - Using the linear expansion formula \(\Delta L = \alpha L \Delta T\), where \( \alpha = 1.30 \times 10^{-4} \) per Kelvin and \(\Delta T = 100\) K, the new grating spacing \( d_2 \) is determined.
   - The angle change (\(\Delta \theta\)) is found by recalculating the diffraction equation with the expanded grating. The result indicates a decrease in the angle due to increased grating spacing.

3. **Identifying Wavelengths Producing a Bright Fringe:**
   - A mixture of light ranging from 410 nm to 660 nm is used, and the grating has 2850 lines per centimeter.
   - A bright fringe at 30 degrees is observed.
   - Using the equation \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{m \lambda}{d} \), where \( d = \frac{1}{28500} \) meters, one calculates possible wavelengths for different orders (\( m \)).
   - The calculations show that the 3rd and 4th order maxima produce bright fringes at 30 degrees corresponding to wavelengths of approximately 585 nm and 459 nm, respectively.
   - These wavelengths are within the given range (410-660 nm) and thus produce observable bright fringes.

The text describes three physics problems involving diffraction gratings and monochromatic light. Here's a summary:

1. **Determining Lines per Centimeter:**
   - Monochromatic light with a wavelength of 495 nm in a vacuum is used, observed through a spectroscope to produce a second-order maximum at an angle of 9.79 degrees.
   - The diffraction grating equation \( m \sin(\theta) = m\lambda/d \) is used to calculate the distance between lines (d).
   - By rearranging and solving for \( d \), the calculation gives a result in meters, which is then converted to inverse centimeters. The final result is approximately 1.72 × 10³ lines per centimeter.

2. **Effect of Temperature on Diffraction Angle:**
   - A diffraction grating with a known line spacing (d = 1.25 × 10⁻⁵ m) and monochromatic light of wavelength 656 nm is used.
   - The angle for the seventh-order maximum is calculated using the diffraction equation.
   - After heating the grating by 100°C, its linear expansion causes a change in d. The coefficient of linear expansion (1.30 × 10⁻⁴ per °C) helps calculate this change.
   - A new angle is calculated with the expanded d value, and the change in angle (∆θ) is found to be approximately -0.2901 radians, indicating that the angle decreases as the grating expands.

3. **Identifying Wavelengths for a Given Angle:**
   - A diffraction grating experiment uses light ranging from 410 to 660 nm with a line density of 2850 lines per centimeter.
   - A bright fringe is observed at 30 degrees, and the task is to identify which wavelengths cause this angle using the equation \( \sin(\theta) = m\lambda/D \).
   - By calculating for different orders (m), it's found that third-order maxima (m=3) with a wavelength of 585 nm, and fourth-order maxima (m=4) with a wavelength of 459 nm, fit within the given range and produce a bright fringe at 30 degrees.
