To solve the problem described, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Problem Details
1. **Sodium Ion Acceleration**: A sodium ion (Na⁺) is accelerated through a potential difference of 300 volts.

2. **Charged State**: The sodium ion has lost one electron, meaning its charge \( q \) is equal to the elementary charge \( e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \) C.

3. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the momentum of the ion.
   - Determine the de Broglie wavelength of the ion.

### Key Concepts and Equations

- **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: When a charge \( q \) is accelerated through a potential difference \( V \), it gains kinetic energy given by:
  \[
  KE = qV
  \]
  
- **Momentum (p)**: The momentum of an object with mass \( m \) and velocity \( v \) is:
  \[
  p = mv
  \]
  Also, from the kinetic energy equation:
  \[
  KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{2KE}{m}}
  \]
  Therefore, momentum can be expressed as:
  \[
  p = m\sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} = \sqrt{2mqV}
  \]

- **de Broglie Wavelength (\(\lambda\))**: The wavelength associated with a particle is given by de Broglie's equation:
  \[
  \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
  \]
  where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \) Js is Planck’s constant.

### Calculations

1. **Calculate the Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   KE = qV = (1.60 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C})(300 \, \text{V}) = 4.80 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Determine the Mass of Sodium Ion**:
   - Number of protons \( = 11 \)
   - Number of neutrons \( = 12 \)
   - Approximate mass of proton \( m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
   - Approximate mass of neutron \( m_n = 1.68 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)

   Total mass \( m \) of the sodium ion:
   \[
   m = 11m_p + 12m_n = 11(1.67 \times 10^{-27}) + 12(1.68 \times 10^{-27})
   \]
   \[
   m = (18.37 + 20.16) \times 10^{-27} = 38.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Momentum**:
   \[
   p = \sqrt{2mqV} = \sqrt{2(38.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg})(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C})(300 \, \text{V})}
   \]
   \[
   p = \sqrt{2 \times 38.53 \times 10^{-27} \times 4.80 \times 10^{-17}}
   \]
   \[
   p = \sqrt{3.698784 \times 10^{-42}} = 1.92 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{kg m/s}
   \]

4. **Calculate the de Broglie Wavelength**:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}}{1.92 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{kg m/s}}
   \]
   \[
   \lambda = 3.45 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m}
   \]

### Conclusion
- **Momentum**: \( p = 1.92 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{kg m/s} \)
- **de Broglie Wavelength**: \( \lambda = 3.45 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m} \) (or 0.345 nm)

Note: There was an error in the original statement regarding the wavelength unit; it should be nanometers or meters, not micrometers.

The text suggests that solving the given problem is straightforward, with the primary challenge being determining the mass of a sodium ion. This implies that other aspects of the problem are manageable once the mass is known.
