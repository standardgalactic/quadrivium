The text provides an overview of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism risks among hospitalized patients, highlighting the importance of prophylaxis due to high incidence rates. It focuses on prevention strategies, including mechanical methods like stockings and pharmacological agents such as Clexane (enoxaparin) and heparin. Timing of thromboprophylaxis around surgeries and anesthesia is crucial to avoid complications like epidural hematomas, necessitating effective communication among healthcare providers.

The text also considers immune-compromised patients, especially those with HIV or undergoing transplants, noting that drugs affecting liver and renal function require careful pre-surgical optimization. Nutrition issues are discussed, contrasting morbid obesity with malnutrition; serum albumin is noted as a predictor for pulmonary complications, while obesity is debated as an independent risk factor due to its association with post-operative infections and longer ICU stays. BMI is used to assess surgical risks, affecting healthcare costs.

Age-related risks in anesthesia are examined, emphasizing the impact of coexisting diseases over age itself. Pain management and psychological considerations, including end-of-life care, are highlighted as crucial for elderly patients. The text concludes with gratitude.
