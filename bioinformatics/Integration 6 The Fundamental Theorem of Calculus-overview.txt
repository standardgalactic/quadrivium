The text emphasizes understanding the fundamental theorem of calculus, which connects differentiation and integration by stating that they are inverse processes. While memorizing methods is helpful, grasping this concept aids in easier application.

To illustrate, consider distance (s) and velocity (v) from physics: 

- Differentiation transforms a function representing distance over time into one representing instantaneous velocity.
- Conversely, integration calculates the total distance traveled by finding the area under the velocity-time curve between two points.

This process is encapsulated by the fundamental theorem of calculus: the definite integral of a function on an interval equals the difference in its antiderivative evaluated at the interval's bounds. 

The explanation uses simple examples (like \(s = 2t\)) to show that integrating velocity over time gives distance traveled, represented by the area under the curve between two points. This concept holds even for more complex functions, where integration involves summing infinite infinitesimal areas.

Additionally, the text discusses notation: \(\int f(x) \, dx\) represents the integral of \(f\) with respect to \(x\), analogous to finding the area of small rectangles under a curve (\(v \cdot dt\) in velocity-time terms).

Ultimately, understanding this theorem clarifies why substituting limits and subtracting after integration returns the original function's change over an interval.

The text discusses the importance of understanding the fundamental theorem of calculus, which connects differentiation and integration by showing they are inverse processes. It emphasizes grasping the reasoning behind this theorem rather than just memorizing methods or proofs.

To illustrate the concept, it uses an example from physics involving distance (denoted as uppercase \( f \)) and velocity (lowercase \( f' \) or \( v \)). Differentiation of a distance function gives the velocity. For instance, if \( s(t) = 2t \), then its derivative \( s'(t) = 2 \) represents constant velocity.

The text explains that integrating velocity over time yields the total distance traveled, which is represented as the area under the velocity-time curve. This area corresponds to a definite integral of the velocity function. When calculating this, one evaluates the original distance function at two points and subtracts these values (i.e., \( f(b) - f(a) \)), reinforcing that integration over an interval gives back the difference in the initial function's values.

The explanation also touches on notation: why we write integrals as \( \int f(x) \, dx \). This stems from considering infinitesimally small rectangles under a curve (height \( f(x) \), width \( dx \)) to compute areasâ€”key to understanding definite integrals.

In essence, the fundamental theorem of calculus bridges derivatives and integrals, providing a powerful framework for analyzing continuous change across various fields like physics.
