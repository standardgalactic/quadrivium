The text discusses the process of constructing mathematical proofs with a focus on using definitions as foundational elements. It outlines an approach where proofs are built by starting with agreed-upon definitions, such as those related to set operations. The example provided involves proving that \( A_1 - A_2 = A_1 \cap A_2^c \), which requires demonstrating both subset relations: 

1. Proving \( A_1 - A_2 \subseteq A_1 \cap A_2^c \) using the definition of set difference.
2. Showing \( A_1 \cap A_2^c \subseteq A_1 - A_2 \) through definitions of intersection and complement.

This dual demonstration establishes that two sets are equal by showing mutual subset relationships, encapsulated in the principle: if \( f \subseteq g \) and \( g \subseteq f \), then \( f = g \). The text highlights a methodological approach where foundational definitions form a "box" of known information used to construct new proofs.

Key points include:

1. **Utilizing Definitions**: Employing established definitions within this "box" helps construct logical arguments.
   
2. **Proof Construction**: An example is given where set expressions are shown as equivalent using these foundational definitions.

3. **Logical Flow**: Proofs are constructed by logically rewriting one operation in terms of another, demonstrating equivalence through defined steps.

4. **Building on Previous Work**: New proofs add to the "box" of known information, aiding future proof construction.

5. **Complexity Management**: Managing this growing body of knowledge is essential for developing complex arguments from simpler truths.

Overall, the text underscores the critical role of definitions in mathematical reasoning and their utility in building intricate proofs from established principles.

The text discusses the methodology of constructing mathematical proofs by leveraging well-defined terms and concepts. It highlights starting with agreed-upon definitions as foundational elements to build proofs. The example provided is demonstrating the equality \( A_1 - A_2 = A_1 \cap A_2^c \). This involves proving two subset relationships:

1. Showing that \( A_1 - A_2 \subseteq A_1 \cap A_2^c \) by using the definition of set difference.
2. Demonstrating \( A_1 \cap A_2^c \subseteq A_1 - A_2 \) through definitions of intersection and complement.

The concept is that proving equality requires demonstrating both directions, thereby establishing that the two sets are identical. It introduces a criterion for set equality: if one set is a subset of another and vice versa, then they are equal.

Key ideas presented include:

- **Utilizing Definitions**: Employing established definitions to construct proofs.
- **Proof Construction**: Using definitions to show equivalence between expressions involving sets.
- **Logical Flow**: Rewriting one set operation in terms of another using logical steps.
- **Building on Previous Work**: Once proven, results become part of known information for future proofs.
- **Complexity Management**: As more proofs accumulate, managing this knowledge is crucial for further proof construction.

Overall, the text underscores the role of definitions in mathematical reasoning, enabling complex arguments to be developed from simpler truths.
