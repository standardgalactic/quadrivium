Kidney failure can cause coagulation problems and higher bleeding risks during surgery due to impaired platelet function from uremia. This impairment affects platelet adhesion, aggregation, and release, leading to extended bleeding time. Desmopressin may help correct this, but if unsuccessful and the bleeding risk is high, a platelet transfusion might be needed. Hemodialysis may also be necessary to treat the underlying uremia.
