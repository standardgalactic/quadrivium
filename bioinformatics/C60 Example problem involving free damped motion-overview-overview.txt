The text provides an overview of solving second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients using two example problems: one for an overdamped system and another for a critically damped system.

1. **First Problem (Overdamped System):**
   - The equation is homogeneous, leading to the auxiliary equation \( m^2 + 5m + 4 = 0 \).
   - Solving this gives distinct roots \( m_1 = -4 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \), resulting in a general solution: 
     \[
     x(t) = c_1 e^{-4t} + c_2 e^{-t}
     \]
   - Applying initial conditions \( x(0) = 1 \) and \( x'(0) = 1 \), the constants are determined by solving:
     - \( c_1 + c_2 = 1 \)
     - \( -4c_1 - c_2 = 1 \)
   - This results in \( c_1 = -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( c_2 = \frac{5}{3} \).
   - The specific solution is:
     \[
     x(t) = -\frac{2}{3} e^{-4t} + \frac{5}{3} e^{-t}
     \]

2. **Second Problem (Critically Damped System):**
   - The auxiliary equation \( m^2 + 8m + 16 = 0 \) factors to \( (m + 4)^2 = 0 \), giving a repeated root \( m_1 = m_2 = -4 \).
   - The general solution is:
     \[
     x(t) = c_1 e^{-4t} + c_2 te^{-4t}
     \]
   - With initial conditions \( x(0) = 0 \) and \( x'(0) = -3 \), we find:
     - \( c_1 = 0 \)
     - Solving for \( c_2 \) using the derivative gives \( c_2 = -3 \).
   - The specific solution is:
     \[
     x(t) = -3te^{-4t}
     \]

The text concludes by indicating that future topics will cover solving problems involving complex numbers.
