The text explains how to convert a complex number into polar form using the example of \(-3 - 3i\). Here is a summary:

1. **Plotting on the Complex Plane:**
   - The complex number \(-3 - 3i\) corresponds to moving left 3 units (negative real part) and down 3 units (negative imaginary part).
   - This places the point in the third quadrant of the complex plane.

2. **Angle Calculation:**
   - Since both components are equal in magnitude, the angle with the negative x-axis bisects a 90-degree angle, resulting in an angle of \(\pi/4\) radians (45 degrees) from either axis.
   - As the direction is clockwise from the positive real axis to the point, the total angle is \(180^\circ + 45^\circ = 225^\circ\), or in radians, \(\pi + \pi/4 = 5\pi/4\).
   - To adhere to polar coordinate conventions (angles between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\)), this becomes \(-3\pi/4\).

3. **Modulus Calculation:**
   - The modulus \(r\) is calculated as \(\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}\).

4. **Polar Form Representation:**
   - The polar form of the complex number is \(3\sqrt{2} (\cos(-3\pi/4) + i\sin(-3\pi/4))\).

The text also briefly describes a second example, \(2\sqrt{3} - 2i\), indicating it will be positioned at an angle around \(-\pi/6\) radians in the fourth quadrant.

The text appears to be an explanation of how to determine the angle for a complex number in polar form. Here's a summary:

1. **Context**: The goal is to find the argument (angle) of a complex number and it has been deduced that this angle will be \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\).

2. **Modulus Calculation**: 
   - Given a complex number with components, the modulus is calculated as \(4\) using the formula for magnitude: \(\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}\), where \(x = 2\sqrt{3}\) and \(y = -2\).

3. **Trigonometric Values**:
   - The cosine of the angle \(\theta\) is found to be \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).
   - The sine of the angle \(\theta\) is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Quadrant Determination**: 
   - Since cosine is positive and sine is negative, the angle lies in the fourth quadrant.

5. **Angle Identification**:
   - In standard position for a 30-degree reference (\(\frac{\pi}{6}\)), if placed in the fourth quadrant, it becomes \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\).

6. **Conclusion**: 
   - The complex number is expressed as \(4e^{i(-\pi/6)}\) or \(4(\cos(-\pi/6) + i\sin(-\pi/6))\).
   - Visualizing the problem on a unit circle helps quickly identify which quadrant and angle are appropriate, emphasizing the importance of drawing it to scale for clarity.

The text highlights how understanding trigonometric values and their signs in different quadrants can simplify determining angles in complex numbers.
