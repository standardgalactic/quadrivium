The text explains how to convert a complex number into polar form using the example of \(-3 - 3i\). Here is a summary:

1. **Plotting on the Complex Plane:**
   - The complex number \(-3 - 3i\) corresponds to moving left 3 units (negative real part) and down 3 units (negative imaginary part).
   - This places the point in the third quadrant of the complex plane.

2. **Angle Calculation:**
   - Since both components are equal in magnitude, the angle with the negative x-axis bisects a 90-degree angle, resulting in an angle of \(\pi/4\) radians (45 degrees) from either axis.
   - As the direction is clockwise from the positive real axis to the point, the total angle is \(180^\circ + 45^\circ = 225^\circ\), or in radians, \(\pi + \pi/4 = 5\pi/4\).
   - To adhere to polar coordinate conventions (angles between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\)), this becomes \(-3\pi/4\).

3. **Modulus Calculation:**
   - The modulus \(r\) is calculated as \(\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}\).

4. **Polar Form Representation:**
   - The polar form of the complex number is \(3\sqrt{2} (\cos(-3\pi/4) + i\sin(-3\pi/4))\).

The text also briefly describes a second example, \(2\sqrt{3} - 2i\), indicating it will be positioned at an angle around \(-\pi/6\) radians in the fourth quadrant.

The text appears to be an explanation of how to determine the angle for a complex number in polar form. Here's a summary:

1. **Context**: The goal is to find the argument (angle) of a complex number and it has been deduced that this angle will be \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\).

2. **Modulus Calculation**: 
   - Given a complex number with components, the modulus is calculated as \(4\) using the formula for magnitude: \(\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)}\), where \(x = 2\sqrt{3}\) and \(y = -2\).

3. **Trigonometric Values**:
   - The cosine of the angle \(\theta\) is found to be \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).
   - The sine of the angle \(\theta\) is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Quadrant Determination**: 
   - Since cosine is positive and sine is negative, the angle lies in the fourth quadrant.

5. **Angle Identification**:
   - In standard position for a 30-degree reference (\(\frac{\pi}{6}\)), if placed in the fourth quadrant, it becomes \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\).

6. **Conclusion**: 
   - The complex number is expressed as \(4e^{i(-\pi/6)}\) or \(4(\cos(-\pi/6) + i\sin(-\pi/6))\).
   - Visualizing the problem on a unit circle helps quickly identify which quadrant and angle are appropriate, emphasizing the importance of drawing it to scale for clarity.

The text highlights how understanding trigonometric values and their signs in different quadrants can simplify determining angles in complex numbers.

The text describes how to convert a complex number from rectangular form (a + bi) into polar form (r(cos θ + i sin θ)), specifically for the complex numbers \(-3 - 3i\) and \(2\sqrt{3} - 2i\).

1. **Complex Number: \(-3 - 3i\)**
   - **Plotting on the Complex Plane:** The real part is \(-3\) (moving left) and the imaginary part is \(-3i\) (moving down), placing the point in the third quadrant.
   - **Angle Calculation:** Since both components are equal in magnitude but negative, it bisects the 90-degree angle between the axes into two 45-degree angles. The full angle from the positive real axis is \(180^\circ + 45^\circ = 225^\circ\) or \(\frac{5\pi}{4}\) radians.
   - **Polar Form Consideration:** Since the angle must be between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\), it becomes \(-135^\circ\) or \(-\frac{3\pi}{4}\).
   - **Modulus Calculation:** The modulus \(r\) is calculated as \(\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}\).

2. **Complex Number: \(2\sqrt{3} - 2i\)**
   - **Plotting on the Complex Plane:** The real part is \(2\sqrt{3}\) (moving right) and the imaginary part is \(-2i\) (moving down), placing the point in the fourth quadrant.
   - **Angle Calculation:** The angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the point is approximately \(30^\circ\) or \(\frac{\pi}{6}\). Since it's in the fourth quadrant, the angle is negative: \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\).
   - **Modulus Calculation:** The modulus \(r\) is calculated as \(\sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{12 + 4} = \sqrt{16} = 4\).

In summary, the polar forms are:
- For \(-3 - 3i\): \(3\sqrt{2} (\cos(-\frac{3\pi}{4}) + i\sin(-\frac{3\pi}{4}))\)
- For \(2\sqrt{3} - 2i\): \(4 (\cos(-\frac{\pi}{6}) + i\sin(-\frac{\pi}{6}))\)

The text appears to be discussing trigonometric concepts related to finding an angle in polar coordinates or complex numbers. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: Determine that the angle is \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\).

2. **Calculations**:
   - Find the modulus: \(\sqrt{4^2} = 4\).
   - Calculate \(\cos(\theta)\) using \(x = 2\sqrt{3}\), resulting in \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).
   - Determine \(\sin(\theta)\) as \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

3. **Quadrant Analysis**:
   - \(\cos(\theta)\) is positive, and \(\sin(\theta)\) is negative, placing the angle in the fourth quadrant.
   - The reference angle for these values is \(\frac{\pi}{6}\), but since it's in the fourth quadrant, the angle is \(-\frac{\pi}{6}\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Emphasizes drawing the scenario to scale to visually confirm the angle.
   - Highlights the importance of understanding trigonometric signs and quadrants for accurate angle determination.

The text combines mathematical calculations with a visual approach to reinforce understanding of angles in trigonometry.
