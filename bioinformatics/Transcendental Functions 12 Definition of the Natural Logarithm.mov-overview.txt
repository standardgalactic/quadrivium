The text provides an explanation and definition of the natural logarithm function using definite integrals. It begins by discussing the inverse relationship between exponential functions \( f(x) = a^x \) and logarithmic functions, specifically explaining that if \( y = a^x \), then its inverse is \( x = \log_a(y) \). By taking the logarithm of both sides, this relationship becomes clear: \( x = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(a)} \).

The discussion progresses to define the natural logarithm (\(\ln(x)\)) as a definite integral. The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) and its inverse is described through integration from 1 to \( x \) of \( \frac{1}{t} dt\). While this does not yield a simple antiderivative (as it involves integrating over an interval where the exponent would become zero), it defines \(\ln(x)\) on the interval from 1 to \( x \).

The text elaborates on interpreting \(\ln(x)\) as areas under curves. For \( x > 1 \), \(\ln(x)\) represents the area under \( y = \frac{1}{t} \) from \( t = 1 \) to \( t = x \). For \( 0 < x < 1 \), \(\ln(x)\) is negative, representing the negative of the area from \( t = x \) to \( t = 1\). The natural logarithm at \( x = 1 \) results in zero because it represents an interval with no width. Additionally, \(\ln(e) = 1\) due to the properties of Euler's number (\( e \)) as the base of natural logs.

Overall, this definition ties together concepts from calculus and algebra to provide a comprehensive understanding of the natural logarithm function through integration and its graphical interpretation.
