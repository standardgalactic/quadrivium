The text discusses the concept of a dielectric in capacitors, particularly focusing on how inserting a dielectric affects various properties when either a battery is attached or removed. Here’s a summary:

1. **Dielectrics and Capacitance**: A dielectric is a material inserted between capacitor plates to increase capacitance. The constant for vacuum (kappa, denoted as κ) equals one. Materials with a higher dielectric constant (κ > 1) increase the capacitance when placed in a capacitor.

2. **Initial Scenario**: A parallel plate capacitor with an initial capacitance of \(13.5 \times 10^{-12}\) farads and connected to a 12.5-volt battery builds up charge. After charging, the battery is disconnected, and then a porcelain slab (κ = 6.50) is inserted.

3. **Electric Potential Energy Calculation**: The initial potential energy (\(U\)) of the capacitor can be calculated using \( U = \frac{1}{2} CV^2 \). Since charge remains constant after disconnecting the battery, inserting a dielectric reduces voltage but keeps charge constant.

4. **Effect of Dielectrics**:
   - If the battery is removed before inserting a dielectric: Charge (q) remains constant, so \( V \) decreases.
   - With the dielectric inserted and the battery still connected: 
     - The potential difference (V) remains constant due to the battery.
     - Capacitance increases as \( C_{\text{final}} = \kappa C \).
     - Charge on the capacitor increases because it is maintained by the battery, leading to an increase in stored energy (\( U_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} \kappa C V^2 \)).
     - The electric field decreases due to increased capacitance and dielectric constant (though charge increase with battery connected slightly modifies this).

5. **Key Points**: 
   - Replace ε₀ with κε₀ in equations.
   - Capacitance changes to \( \kappa C \).
   - Determine if the battery remains or is removed to decide which equations to use.
   - Charge and potential energy calculations depend on whether the battery stays connected during dielectric insertion.

This summary emphasizes how dielectrics affect capacitance, charge, potential difference, electric field, and stored energy in capacitors under different conditions.

The text discusses changes in a capacitor's properties when modifications are made, specifically involving the insertion of a dielectric material and changing the distance between plates.

1. **Initial Conditions**: A plate capacitor with capacitance \( C \) is given an initial separation distance \( d \).

2. **Modifications**:
   - A dielectric with dielectric constant \( \kappa \) is inserted.
   - The separation distance between the plates is doubled (\( 2d \)).

3. **Resulting Changes**:
   - The final capacitance becomes twice the initial capacitance, i.e., \( 2C \).
   
4. **Calculation of Dielectric Constant \( \kappa \)**:
   - Capacitance formula for a plate capacitor is given by \( C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d} \), where \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space and \( A \) is the area of the plates.
   - After inserting the dielectric and doubling the distance, the new capacitance formula becomes \( C' = \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{2d} \).
   - Setting \( C' = 2C \), we derive: 
     \[
     \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{2d} = 2 \times \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
     \]
   - Solving for \( \kappa \) gives:
     \[
     \kappa = 4
     \]

Thus, the dielectric constant \( \kappa \) is determined to be 4. The text confirms this as a well-posed problem and provides reassurance of its correctness.
