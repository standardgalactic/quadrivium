The text discusses the concept of a dielectric in capacitors, particularly focusing on how inserting a dielectric affects various properties when either a battery is attached or removed. Here’s a summary:

1. **Dielectrics and Capacitance**: A dielectric is a material inserted between capacitor plates to increase capacitance. The constant for vacuum (kappa, denoted as κ) equals one. Materials with a higher dielectric constant (κ > 1) increase the capacitance when placed in a capacitor.

2. **Initial Scenario**: A parallel plate capacitor with an initial capacitance of \(13.5 \times 10^{-12}\) farads and connected to a 12.5-volt battery builds up charge. After charging, the battery is disconnected, and then a porcelain slab (κ = 6.50) is inserted.

3. **Electric Potential Energy Calculation**: The initial potential energy (\(U\)) of the capacitor can be calculated using \( U = \frac{1}{2} CV^2 \). Since charge remains constant after disconnecting the battery, inserting a dielectric reduces voltage but keeps charge constant.

4. **Effect of Dielectrics**:
   - If the battery is removed before inserting a dielectric: Charge (q) remains constant, so \( V \) decreases.
   - With the dielectric inserted and the battery still connected: 
     - The potential difference (V) remains constant due to the battery.
     - Capacitance increases as \( C_{\text{final}} = \kappa C \).
     - Charge on the capacitor increases because it is maintained by the battery, leading to an increase in stored energy (\( U_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} \kappa C V^2 \)).
     - The electric field decreases due to increased capacitance and dielectric constant (though charge increase with battery connected slightly modifies this).

5. **Key Points**: 
   - Replace ε₀ with κε₀ in equations.
   - Capacitance changes to \( \kappa C \).
   - Determine if the battery remains or is removed to decide which equations to use.
   - Charge and potential energy calculations depend on whether the battery stays connected during dielectric insertion.

This summary emphasizes how dielectrics affect capacitance, charge, potential difference, electric field, and stored energy in capacitors under different conditions.

The text discusses changes in a capacitor's properties when modifications are made, specifically involving the insertion of a dielectric material and changing the distance between plates.

1. **Initial Conditions**: A plate capacitor with capacitance \( C \) is given an initial separation distance \( d \).

2. **Modifications**:
   - A dielectric with dielectric constant \( \kappa \) is inserted.
   - The separation distance between the plates is doubled (\( 2d \)).

3. **Resulting Changes**:
   - The final capacitance becomes twice the initial capacitance, i.e., \( 2C \).
   
4. **Calculation of Dielectric Constant \( \kappa \)**:
   - Capacitance formula for a plate capacitor is given by \( C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d} \), where \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space and \( A \) is the area of the plates.
   - After inserting the dielectric and doubling the distance, the new capacitance formula becomes \( C' = \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{2d} \).
   - Setting \( C' = 2C \), we derive: 
     \[
     \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{2d} = 2 \times \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
     \]
   - Solving for \( \kappa \) gives:
     \[
     \kappa = 4
     \]

Thus, the dielectric constant \( \kappa \) is determined to be 4. The text confirms this as a well-posed problem and provides reassurance of its correctness.

The text discusses the concept of a dielectric in capacitors and how it affects various properties such as capacitance, electric potential energy, charge, and electric fields. Here's a summary:

1. **Dielectric Basics**:
   - A dielectric is a material placed between the plates of a capacitor.
   - In a vacuum (kappa = 1), inserting a dielectric with kappa > 1 increases capacitance.
   
2. **Capacitor Problem Example**:
   - A parallel plate capacitor with a given capacitance and voltage is charged, then isolated from the battery.
   - Inserting a porcelain slab (dielectric constant of 6.50) affects its properties.

3. **Potential Energy Calculation**:
   - Before inserting the dielectric, potential energy \( U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \).
   - After removing the battery and inserting the dielectric, charge remains constant, but capacitance increases by a factor of kappa.
   
4. **Effect on Capacitor Properties**:
   - With dielectric: 
     - Capacitance increases (becomes \( kC \)).
     - If battery remains connected: Voltage stays constant, charge increases, and energy stored increases (\( U = \frac{1}{2} kCV^2 \)).
     - Electric field decreases due to increased capacitance but can increase if charge also increases because the battery is connected.

5. **Important Considerations**:
   - Always adjust equations to include kappa.
   - Determine if the battery remains connected or is removed, as this affects whether charge (q) remains constant or changes with dielectric insertion.

In summary, inserting a dielectric in a capacitor generally increases capacitance and can affect other properties like potential energy and electric fields depending on whether the battery remains connected.

The text discusses changes in a capacitor system when a dielectric material is inserted, and the distance between the plates is doubled. Initially, the capacitance (\(C\)) of the plate capacitor is given as \(c\). The process involves two main steps: inserting a dielectric with a constant \(\kappa\) (kappa) and doubling the separation distance from \(d\) to \(2d\).

Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Capacitance**: For a parallel plate capacitor without a dielectric, capacitance is given by:
   \[
   C = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d}
   \]
   where \(\varepsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space, \(A\) is the area of the plates, and \(d\) is the distance between them.

2. **Effect of Dielectric**: Inserting a dielectric with constant \(\kappa\) modifies the capacitance:
   \[
   C' = \frac{\kappa \varepsilon_0 A}{d}
   \]

3. **Doubling the Distance**: The distance is doubled to \(2d\), altering the new capacitance:
   \[
   C'' = \frac{\kappa \varepsilon_0 A}{2d}
   \]

4. **Final Capacitance and Calculation of \(\kappa\)**: It's given that the final capacitance is twice the initial (\(2c\)):
   \[
   C'' = 2C
   \]
   Substituting for \(C\) and rearranging gives:
   \[
   \frac{\kappa \varepsilon_0 A}{2d} = 2 \times \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d}
   \]

5. **Solving for \(\kappa\)**: Simplifying the equation results in:
   \[
   \frac{\kappa}{2} = 2
   \]
   Therefore, solving for \(\kappa\) gives:
   \[
   \kappa = 4.0
   \]

The text concludes that the dielectric constant \(\kappa\) is determined to be 4.0 based on these changes.
