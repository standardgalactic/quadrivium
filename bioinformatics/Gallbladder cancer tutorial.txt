So today on Let's Talk Surgery we're going to discuss gallbladder carcinoma or cancer of the
gallbladder. Now for many places that would be the most common cancer of the biliary tree and
indeed so it is with my unit. Now we do see this in the older population and we have a female
predominance as far as these tumors are concerned. Unfortunately the vast majority of the patients
that do come to us have very advanced disease because what happens to gallbladder cancer it
invades locally, it spreads via the venous system, it spreads via lymphatics so when we do see these
patients they already have obstructive jaundice as there's local infiltration of the biliary tree
and many of these tumors are unresectable and all we can really do for the patient is palliative care
where we will drain the biliary system either via drainage percutaneously or via
the biliary duct from the ampulla side. Why do these patients develop gallbladder cancer?
There are a few risk factors that you must be aware of. The vast majority of them will have
gallstones although gallstones are very prevalent in the vast majority of people gallstones will not
develop gallbladder cancer so you know we have to say though that the vast majority of them do have
gallstones. Porcelain gallbladder that's calcification of the wall you know there are various reports from
a very low incidence of porcelain gallbladder to about 60% incidence of porcelain gallbladder I think
the majority of cases these days only put it about two or three percent so not really. We do see
polyps as well as a premalignant lesion you get benign and premalignant polyps at least
adenomatous polyps but we also see just normal cholesterol or inflammatory polyps as well so you've got
to think of patients with polyps. Patients with sclerosing cholangitis that would also be a risk
factor and then certain parts of the world like South America where we see salmonella infections
they have a higher incidence at least of gallbladder cancer than we would have down here locally so
you've got to think of those infections. There are some reports of Helicobacter pylori in the biliary
tree as well so that might also be one of the risk factors. So many of these patients will have previous
symptoms of biliary colic some form of biliary tree or symptoms at least similar to perhaps
biliary colic from just normal cholelothiasis we do see patients with that the majority of them will
come in they would already have lost weight as I said they are jaundiced from local infiltration
and obstruction of the biliary tree and we do see I must say also the very fortunate patient where we
will do an ultrasound we will see gallstones diagnose acute cholecystitis and we'll book a
cholecystectomy and then on histology it might come back that there's an insight to a very early
gallbladder carcinoma and in those cases where there's a clear margin it's well within the wall
of the gallbladder we're not going to go back and do any further surgery. In a tertiary unit where we deal
with gallbladder carcinomas patients will be fully worked up as I said many of these cases advanced
and it's all about is surgery possible so the patient will go through a full range of investigations
imaging investigations which might just mean a CT scan and MRI but also then specifically of the
biliary tree and we might just do ERCPs as well or PTCs etc those of course are also used just for the
palliation in case there is a resection is not possible you have to have a wide margin or at
least a clear margin of resection so parts of the liver will also have to be removed and in many
cases that would mean the biliary tree as well so there will need to be a hookup between the
intra-hepatic bile ducts and the enteric system so these patients tend to have a very poor prognosis
and we see you know on average for us nothing more than a six month survival and very poor
five-year survival rates and the only ones that we do see are those incidental
in cytocarcinomas that we do a normal cholecystectomy for for acute cholecystitis
so fortunately a rare disease that we don't see often very poor prognosis and something that you
just have to watch out for and please refer them to a tertiary unit where these patients can be managed
properly
