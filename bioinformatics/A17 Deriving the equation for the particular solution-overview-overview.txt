The text describes the process of solving non-homogeneous linear differential equations using the variation of parameters method. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Initial Setup**: The goal is to solve \( x' = Ax + f(t) \), where \( A \) is a matrix and \( f(t) \) is a vector function.

2. **Complementary Solution**: The solution for the homogeneous part, \( x_c = \Phi(t)c \), involves the fundamental matrix \( \Phi(t) \).

3. **Variation of Parameters**: Replace constants in \( x_c \) with a vector function \( u(t) \). Propose a particular solution as \( x_p = \Phi(t)u(t) \).

4. **Derivative and Substitution**: Differentiate to get \( x'_p = \Phi(t)u'(t) + A\Phi(t)u(t) \). Substitute into the original equation, simplifying to \( \Phi(t)u'(t) = f(t) \).

5. **Solving for \( u(t) \)**: Multiply by \( \Phi^{-1}(t) \) and integrate:
   \[
   u(t) = \int \Phi^{-1}(t)f(t) \, dt
   \]

6. **Particular Solution**: The particular solution is:
   \[
   x_p = \Phi(t) \int \Phi^{-1}(t)f(t) \, dt
   \]

7. **General Solution**: Combine the complementary and particular solutions:
   \[
   x = \Phi(t)c + \Phi(t) \int \Phi^{-1}(t)f(t) \, dt
   \]

This method provides a structured approach to finding particular solutions for non-homogeneous linear differential equations.
