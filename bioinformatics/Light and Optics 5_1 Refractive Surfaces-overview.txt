The text provides an explanation of how refraction occurs at a spherical refracting surface, specifically distinguishing it from lenses. It introduces an equation for determining image formation by refraction:

\[ \frac{N_1}{S_0} + \frac{N_2}{S_i} = \frac{N_2 - N_1}{R} \]

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and conventions discussed in the text:

1. **Refracting Surface**: The context is about refraction at a single spherical surface, not lenses.

2. **Mediums and Refractive Indices**:
   - \(N_1\): Refractive index of the medium containing the object.
   - \(N_2\): Refractive index of the medium on the other side of the refracting surface.
   
3. **Curvature (R)**:
   - For a concave surface facing the object, \( R \) is negative.
   - For a convex surface facing the object, \( R \) is positive.

4. **Image Position (\(S_i\))**:
   - If the image forms on the opposite side of the refracting surface compared to the object, \( S_i \) is positive (real image).
   - If it forms on the same side as the object, \( S_i \) is negative (virtual image).

5. **Example Problem**:
   - A piece of amber (\(N_1 = 1.6\)) with a convex surface facing air (\(N_2 = 1.0\)).
   - The radius \( R \) is +3 mm because it appears convex from the outside but concave for an object inside, making it effectively negative in this context.
   - The insect's image is virtual and located 5 mm deep as viewed from outside (\(S_i = -5\) mm).

6. **Calculation**:
   - Using the equation: 
     \[ \frac{1.6}{S_0} + \frac{1.0}{-5} = \frac{1.0 - 1.6}{-3} \]
   - Solving this will determine \( S_0 \), the actual depth of the object inside the amber.

The text emphasizes understanding these conventions for correctly determining image properties in various optical setups involving spherical refracting surfaces.

The text describes a calculation process where various fractions are summed up. It starts with calculating \( \frac{1.6}{\left(\frac{0.6}{3}\right)} + \frac{1}{5} \), which results in the total of 4.00. This result is given in millimeters, indicating that an object will be located at a distance of 4 millimeters from a reference point. The calculation takes into account positive distances from the object to the surface, concluding positively as planned.
