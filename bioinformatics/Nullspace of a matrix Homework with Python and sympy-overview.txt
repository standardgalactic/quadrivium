To calculate the dimension of the null space (also known as the nullity) for your matrix \( A \), you can use the Rank-Nullity Theorem. This theorem states:

\[ 
\text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n 
\]

where:
- \(\text{rank}(A)\) is the rank of the matrix, i.e., the number of linearly independent rows or columns.
- \(\text{nullity}(A)\) is the dimension of the null space of \( A \).
- \(n\) is the number of columns in the matrix.

For your specific example:

1. **Matrix \( A \):**

   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 
   1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
   2 & 1 & 1 \\ 
   3 & 1 & 4 
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

   You've already determined that the rank of \( A \) is 3, since all columns are linearly independent.

2. **Number of Columns (\( n \)):**

   Matrix \( A \) has 3 columns.

3. **Apply the Rank-Nullity Theorem:**

   \[
   \text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n 
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   3 + \text{nullity}(A) = 3
   \]

4. **Solve for Nullity:**

   \[
   \text{nullity}(A) = 3 - 3 = 0
   \]

Thus, the dimension of the null space of matrix \( A \) is 0. This means that the only solution to the homogeneous system \( Ax = 0 \) is the trivial solution \( x = 0 \). Therefore, the null space contains only the zero vector, and it does not span any subspace other than the trivial one-dimensional subspace consisting solely of the zero vector.

It seems like you're exploring concepts in linear algebra related to vector spaces, specifically dealing with the sum of subspaces, rank, nullity, and Gauss-Jordan elimination. Let me summarize and clarify these concepts for you:

### Key Concepts

1. **Subspace Sum**: 
   - When you add two subspaces \( U \) and \( V \), denoted as \( U + V \), the result is a subspace consisting of all vectors that can be expressed as the sum of a vector from \( U \) and a vector from \( V \).

2. **Rank**:
   - The rank of a matrix \( A \) refers to the maximum number of linearly independent column vectors in the matrix, which is also equal to the dimension of its column space (the span of its columns).
   - If you have more columns than rows in your matrix, the rank cannot exceed the number of rows because each row can contribute at most one independent direction.

3. **Nullity**:
   - The nullity of a matrix \( A \) is the dimension of its null space (the set of all solutions to the homogeneous equation \( Ax = 0 \)).
   - According to the Rank-Nullity Theorem, for an \( m \times n \) matrix \( A \): 
     \[
     \text{Rank}(A) + \text{Nullity}(A) = n
     \]
   - This means that if you know the rank, you can determine the nullity as \( n - \text{Rank}(A) \).

4. **Gauss-Jordan Elimination**:
   - This is a method used to transform matrices into row-reduced echelon form (RREF), which makes it easier to solve systems of linear equations and find ranks, null spaces, etc.

5. **Column Space vs. Null Space**:
   - The column space of \( A \) consists of all possible linear combinations of its column vectors.
   - The null space contains all solutions to the equation \( Ax = 0 \), essentially describing the "deficiencies" in terms of column space coverage by columns of \( A \).

### Application

In your example, you have a matrix with more columns than rows. Here's how these concepts apply:

- **Rank**: Since there are only three rows, the rank can be at most 3.
- **Nullity**: Given an \( m \times n \) matrix with \( n = 4 \) (four columns) and rank 3, the nullity is \( 4 - 3 = 1 \).
- **Column Space**: The first three linearly independent columns span the column space in this case.
- **Null Space**: A vector that forms a basis for the null space can be found using Gauss-Jordan elimination, resulting in a solution like \([-1, -1, 1, 0]^T\).

### Conclusion

Understanding these concepts allows you to analyze and decompose linear systems effectively. The rank-nullity theorem provides a powerful tool for relating the dimensions of different vector spaces associated with a matrix, helping you predict the structure and solutions of linear equations. If you have further questions or need more examples, feel free to ask!

To prove that the null space is a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^n \), we need to verify three conditions: it contains at least one vector (the zero vector), and it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

### 1. Contains the Zero Vector

The null space of a matrix \( A \) consists of all vectors \( x \) such that \( Ax = 0 \). By definition, if you take \( x = 0 \) (the zero vector in \( \mathbb{R}^n \)), then:

\[ 
A \cdot 0 = 0 
\]

Thus, the zero vector is always in the null space.

### 2. Closed Under Addition

Suppose \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are vectors in the null space of \( A \). This means:

\[ 
Ax_1 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad Ax_2 = 0 
\]

We need to show that their sum, \( x_1 + x_2 \), is also in the null space. Consider:

\[ 
A(x_1 + x_2) = Ax_1 + Ax_2 = 0 + 0 = 0 
\]

Thus, \( x_1 + x_2 \) is in the null space.

### 3. Closed Under Scalar Multiplication

Suppose \( x \) is a vector in the null space of \( A \), and let \( c \) be any scalar. We need to show that \( cx \) is also in the null space. Consider:

\[ 
A(cx) = c(Ax) = c \cdot 0 = 0 
\]

Thus, \( cx \) is in the null space.

### Conclusion

Since the null space contains the zero vector and is closed under both addition and scalar multiplication, it satisfies all the conditions to be a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^n \). Therefore, the null space is indeed a vector space.

The text explains the concept of the null space in linear algebra, emphasizing that if \( \mathbf{x} \) is in the null space of a matrix, then multiplying \( \mathbf{x} \) by any scalar \( c \) results in another vector that is still the zero vector. This demonstrates that scalar multiplication holds within the null space. The text also mentions the ease of verifying such properties using Python, suggesting that computational tools can simplify checking these concepts compared to traditional pen-and-paper methods. Overall, it highlights a clear understanding of the null space's properties when dealing with matrices and encourages the use of programming for verification.

To understand the null space and related concepts, let's break down the process you've described using Python with the `SymPy` library.

### Key Concepts

1. **Matrix Definition**: You defined a \(3 \times 3\) matrix \( A \) as:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 
   1 & 2 & 1 \\ 
   2 & 1 & 3 \\ 
   3 & 1 & 4 
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. **Homogeneous System**: The homogeneous system you're considering is \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \), where \(\mathbf{x}\) is a vector of variables.

3. **Augmented Matrix for Homogeneous System**: You augmented the matrix \( A \) with a column of zeros to form:
   \[
   [A | \mathbf{0}] = \begin{bmatrix} 
   1 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 
   2 & 1 & 3 & 0 \\ 
   3 & 1 & 4 & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

4. **Row Reduction**: Using Gauss-Jordan elimination, you reduced this augmented matrix to its row-reduced echelon form (RREF). The result is:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} 
   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

5. **Interpretation**:
   - The RREF is the identity matrix, indicating that the only solution to \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \) is the trivial solution \(\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\).
   - This implies that the columns of \( A \) are linearly independent.

6. **Null Space**: The null space consists of all vectors \(\mathbf{x}\) such that \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \). Since the only solution is the zero vector, the null space is trivial and contains only the zero vector.

7. **Rank**: The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent column vectors. For matrix \( A \), since all three columns are linearly independent, the rank is 3.

### Summary

- **Null Space**: Trivial, containing only the zero vector.
- **Rank**: 3, indicating full column rank for this square matrix.
- **Implications**: Since the null space is trivial and the rank equals the number of rows (and columns), \( A \) is invertible.

This process confirms that matrix \( A \) has full rank and no non-trivial solutions to the homogeneous system, meaning its determinant is non-zero.

To understand the concepts described in your explanation, let's break down some key ideas related to matrices, vector spaces, and null spaces.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Matrix Dimensions**: A matrix with \( m \) rows and \( n \) columns is referred to as an \( m \times n \) matrix. The vectors within this matrix (column vectors if considering a column-wise perspective) exist in an \( m \)-dimensional space.

2. **Rank of a Matrix**: 
   - The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent row or column vectors in the matrix.
   - For an \( m \times n \) matrix, the rank cannot exceed the smaller of \( m \) or \( n \).

3. **Linear Independence and Dependence**:
   - A set of vectors is said to be linearly independent if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.
   - If at least one vector can be expressed as a combination of others, the set is linearly dependent.

4. **Null Space (Kernel)**:
   - The null space of a matrix \( A \) consists of all vectors \( x \) such that \( Ax = 0 \).
   - The dimension of the null space is called the nullity of the matrix.
   - By the Rank-Nullity Theorem: 
     \[
     \text{Rank}(A) + \text{Nullity}(A) = n
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of columns in \( A \).

5. **Column Space**:
   - The column space (or range) of a matrix consists of all possible linear combinations of its column vectors.
   - It represents all vectors that can be expressed as \( Ax \) for some vector \( x \).

### Application to Your Example:

- You have an \( m \times n \) matrix with more columns than rows (\( n > m \)).
- The rank of this matrix is limited by the number of rows, which in your case is 3.
- Since there are four column vectors but only three can be linearly independent (due to the row limit), one vector must be linearly dependent on the others.

#### Example:

For a \( 3 \times 4 \) matrix:
- **Rank**: 3
- **Nullity**: By Rank-Nullity Theorem, nullity = \( n - \text{rank} = 4 - 3 = 1 \).

This means there is one free variable when solving \( Ax = 0 \), leading to a one-dimensional null space.

### Solving for Null Space:

From the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of your matrix, you derived:
- \( x_1 = -x_3 \)
- \( x_2 = -x_3 \)
- \( x_4 = 0 \)

The solution can be expressed as a vector in terms of the free variable \( x_3 \):
\[ 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4
\end{bmatrix}
=
x_3
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
-1 \\
1 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This vector \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}^T \) is a basis for the null space, confirming that the nullity is indeed 1.

### Conclusion:

The process you've described illustrates how to determine the rank and nullity of a matrix, identify linear dependencies among its columns, and find the basis for its null space. This understanding is crucial in linear algebra for analyzing systems of linear equations and transformations represented by matrices.

Certainly! Let's break down the concepts you're dealing with: null space, column space, rank, and nullity.

### Null Space

The **null space** (or kernel) of a matrix \( A \), denoted as \( N(A) \), is the set of all vectors \( \mathbf{x} \) such that:

\[ A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \]

where \( \mathbf{0} \) is the zero vector. This means if you multiply matrix \( A \) by any vector in its null space, you get the zero vector.

### Column Space

The **column space** of a matrix \( A \), denoted as \( C(A) \), is the span (set of all possible linear combinations) of its column vectors. It represents all possible outputs of the matrix equation \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \).

### Rank

The **rank** of a matrix \( A \) is the dimension of its column space. In other words, it's the maximum number of linearly independent columns in \( A \). The rank tells you how many vectors are needed to span the column space.

### Nullity

The **nullity** of a matrix \( A \) is the dimension of its null space. It represents the number of free variables in the solution to \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \).

### Rank-Nullity Theorem

The rank-nullity theorem provides a relationship between these concepts:

\[ \text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n \]

where \( n \) is the number of columns in matrix \( A \). This equation tells you that the sum of the dimensions of the column space and null space equals the total number of columns.

### Closure Properties

To show that the null space is indeed a vector space, it must satisfy:

1. **Contains the Zero Vector**: The zero vector is always in the null space because \( A\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} \).

2. **Closure under Addition**: If \( \mathbf{x}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{x}_2 \) are in the null space, then \( A(\mathbf{x}_1 + \mathbf{x}_2) = A\mathbf{x}_1 + A\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} \). Thus, \( \mathbf{x}_1 + \mathbf{x}_2 \) is also in the null space.

3. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: If \( \mathbf{x} \) is in the null space and \( c \) is a scalar, then \( A(c\mathbf{x}) = c(A\mathbf{x}) = c\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} \). Thus, \( c\mathbf{x} \) is also in the null space.

These properties confirm that the null space is indeed a subspace of \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

### Summary

- **Null Space**: Solutions to \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \).
- **Column Space**: Span of columns of \( A \).
- **Rank**: Dimension of the column space.
- **Nullity**: Dimension of the null space.
- **Rank-Nullity Theorem**: \( \text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n \).

Understanding these concepts helps in analyzing linear systems and their solutions. If you have specific examples or matrices, feel free to share them for further clarification!

The text explains that if \( \mathbf{x} \) is in the null space of a matrix, then multiplying it by any scalar still results in the zero vector (\(\mathbf{0}\)). This demonstrates that scalar multiplication holds within the null space. The null space consists of all vectors that, when multiplied by the matrix, yield the zero vector. Understanding this concept can be simplified using Python for verification, making manual calculations unnecessary.
