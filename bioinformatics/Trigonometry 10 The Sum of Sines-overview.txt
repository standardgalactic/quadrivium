The text outlines a derivation for sums and differences of sines using trigonometric identities. The author begins by defining expressions \(a = x + y\) and \(b = x - y\), which lead to finding values for \(x\) and \(y\) as \(\frac{a+b}{2}\) and \(\frac{a-b}{2}\) respectively.

Using these definitions, the sine of \(a\) is expressed as \(\sin(x + y) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y\), and the sine of \(b\) as \(\sin(x - y) = \sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y\).

By adding these two expressions, it's found that \(\sin a + \sin b = 2 \sin x \cos y\). Substituting back in terms of \(a\) and \(b\), the result becomes:
\[
\sin a + \sin b = 2 \sin \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{a-b}{2}\right)
\]

For the difference, \(\sin A - \sin B\), similar steps yield:
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos X \sin Y
\]
Substituting back gives:
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)
\]

These results are standard trigonometric identities for the sum and difference of sines.
