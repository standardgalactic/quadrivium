The text outlines the process for evaluating a surface integral over a section of a cone defined by \( Z = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \) with \( Z \) ranging from 1 to 2. The integrand function is given as \( F(X, Y, Z) = (X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2)^{1/2} \).

To compute the surface integral:

1. **Differential Area Element**: 
   - Calculate \( dS \) using:
     \[
     dS = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial X}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial Y}\right)^2 + 1} \, dA
     \]
   - Partial derivatives are:
     \[
     \frac{\partial Z}{\partial X} = \frac{X}{\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}}, \quad \frac{\partial Z}{\partial Y} = \frac{Y}{\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}}
     \]
   - Substituting these yields:
     \[
     dS = \sqrt{2} \, dA
     \]

2. **Function in Polar Coordinates**:
   - Convert \( F(X, Y, Z) \) to polar coordinates:
     \[
     X = R \cos(\theta), \quad Y = R \sin(\theta)
     \]
   - The integrand becomes:
     \[
     F(R, \theta) = R\sqrt{2}
     \]

3. **Region of Integration**:
   - In polar coordinates: \( 1 \leq R \leq 2 \), \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \)

4. **Integral Setup**:
   - The integral is:
     \[
     2 \int_0^{2\pi} \int_1^2 R^3 \, dR \, d\theta
     \]

5. **Evaluate the Integral**:
   - Integrate with respect to \( R \):
     \[
     \int_1^2 R^3 \, dR = \left[\frac{R^4}{4}\right]_1^2 = \frac{15}{4}
     \]
   - Integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
     \[
     2 \cdot \frac{15}{4} \cdot 2\pi = 15\pi
     \]

The surface integral evaluates to \( 15\pi \).

Additionally, the text recounts a personal reflection where an initial error in integration limits (0 to 2 instead of 1 to 2) led to a miscalculation. Correcting this mistake resulted in recalculating the integral as \(8 - 1 = 7\) and ultimately yielding a final answer of \(\frac{28}{3\pi}\), which was deemed more accurate.
