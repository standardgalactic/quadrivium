The text addresses the problem of light waves reflecting off mirrors and achieving destructive interference by analyzing situations involving different optical paths. Destructive interference occurs when waves are out of phase by half a wavelength (\(\lambda/2\)), resulting in cancellation at certain points.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Situation 1**: A single plane mirror reflects a light beam with a wavelength of 620 nm. The incident and reflected beams are initially in phase, traveling an optical path length of \(2L\) (to the mirror and back).

2. **Situation 2**: An additional mirror is placed at distance \(L\), creating an optical path where light travels to this second mirror and back, covering a total path of \(4L\).

### Calculating Path Differences

- For Situation 1, the number of wavelengths fitting into the path (\(N_1\)) is:
  \[
  N_1 = \frac{2L}{\lambda}
  \]

- For Situation 2, the number of wavelengths fitting into the path (\(N_2\)) is:
  \[
  N_2 = \frac{4L}{\lambda}
  \]

### Condition for Destructive Interference

Destructive interference requires a path difference of half a wavelength between the two paths:
\[
N_2 - N_1 = \frac{\lambda}{2}
\]

Substituting \(N_1\) and \(N_2\):
\[
\frac{4L}{\lambda} - \frac{2L}{\lambda} = \frac{\lambda}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2L}{\lambda} = \frac{\lambda}{2}
\]

Solving for \(L\) gives:
\[
L = \frac{\lambda}{4}
\]

For \(\lambda = 620\) nm, the minimum distance \(L\) for destructive interference is 155 nm.

### Next Point of Destructive Interference

The next position with total destructive interference occurs when the path difference equals \(3/2\) wavelengths:
\[
N_2 - N_1 = \frac{3\lambda}{2}
\]

This leads to:
\[
\frac{2L}{\lambda} = \frac{3\lambda}{2}
\]

Solving for \(L\) gives:
\[
L = \frac{3\lambda}{4}
\]

For \(\lambda = 620\) nm, the next distance \(L\) is 465 nm.

### Conclusion

- The first instance of total destructive interference occurs at **155 nanometers**.
- The next position for total destructive interference is at **465 nanometers**. 

This analysis uses optical path differences and conditions for destructive interference to determine these positions.
