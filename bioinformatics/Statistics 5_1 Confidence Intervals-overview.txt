This text is an explanation of confidence intervals in statistics, focusing on their use in making inferences about a population based on a sample. In studies where the entire population cannot be examined (e.g., all humans with a certain disease), researchers analyze a sample to estimate population parameters like the mean. The process involves calculating the sample's mean and standard deviation, then using these to derive a confidence interval that estimates the range within which the true population mean likely falls.

A 95% confidence interval is commonly used, meaning there's a 5% chance that this interval does not contain the true population mean. The formula for a 95% confidence interval is: sample mean Â± 1.96 times the standard error (where the standard error is calculated as standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size). If higher confidence is desired, such as 99%, the interval must be wider.

The number 1.96 arises from assuming a normal distribution and aims to capture 95% of the area under the curve. For different confidence levels (e.g., 80% or 99%), other multipliers are used: 1.282 for 80% and 2.576 for 99%. These values, known as T values, can be found in statistical tables but typically apply to samples with sizes of 40 or more; smaller samples require different calculations.
