The text discusses the concept of inverse functions in the context of transcendental function calculus, focusing on one-to-one functions as a prerequisite for having an inverse. Here's a summary:

1. **Understanding Inverse Functions**: An inverse function reverses the effect of the original function. It only exists if the function is one-to-one, meaning each domain value maps to a unique range value.

2. **Example with Square Root and Squaring**:
   - The function \( y = \sqrt{x} \) is one-to-one within its domain (0 to infinity), as each input yields a unique output.
   - Conversely, \( y = x^2 \) is not one-to-one over all real numbers because different inputs can yield the same output (e.g., both 1 and -1 give an output of 1). However, it becomes one-to-one if restricted to non-negative values.

3. **Finding Inverses Algebraically**:
   - For a function like \( y = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 \), you solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \) and then interchange \( x \) and \( y \) to find the inverse: \( y = 2x - 2 \).

4. **Graphical Representation**:
   - The inverse function swaps the domain and range of the original function.
   - Graphically, you reflect the graph of the original function over the line \( y = x \). This reflection helps visualize how the domain and range are interchanged.

5. **Notation**: 
   - The notation \( f^{-1}(x) \) denotes the inverse of a function \( f(x) \), not an exponentiation to negative one.

This explanation emphasizes both algebraic manipulation and graphical understanding to determine and represent inverse functions effectively.
