In this video, I want to help you to understand what a p-value is when we do research.
Now, I'm going to use the Wolfram language inside of Mathematica to show you what it's all about.
So, don't be worried about the fact that I'm using a computer language here.
It is not about the computer language. I'm just using it instead of using PowerPoint.
So, no PowerPoint slides. I'm going to show you some code. It's not about the code.
I'm not trying to teach you how to write the computer code.
It is only used instead of PowerPoint, for instance, so that I can show you what a p-value is all about.
Now, I've chosen Mathematica in the Wolfram language, though, because it is a fantastic language to do your statistical analysis in
and then also to demonstrate the meaning behind things, how things work.
So, I'm not going to show you, it's not about showing you equations of the p-value.
I want you to understand what a p-value is so that when you do your own research, when you read a paper,
you can understand what a p-value is and specifically, you know, what its uses are and what its shortcomings are.
I'm going to start off by doing something completely different, though.
I want us to go back to school and remember what the equations are for the areas of a shape.
Because, believe it or not, that is what a p-value is.
So, let's just start with that.
Now, I'm here inside Mathematica and I'm going to show you just a few of the reasons why I always choose Mathematica.
Above, say, Python or Julia, there is so much built into Mathematica.
There is knowledge built into the language.
It is a fantastic computer language.
One of the reasons why I absolutely love it is instead of writing code, I can write a normal English sentence.
I can click here and say I want a Wolfram Alpha query.
And I'm simply going to type in area of a square.
So, I did nothing special.
I didn't write any code, nothing like that.
I hit enter and it's going to query the Wolfram Alpha database and give me all this beautiful knowledge about the area of a square.
And that's just me asking a plain, simple question.
So, there we have a square.
Remember, the two sides are equal to each other.
And if I have a side A and the other side A, the area of this square is just A squared.
You remember that from school.
That's not a problem.
Now, it gives you all sorts of other information about the areas of squares.
Look at that.
It's all fantastic, beautiful.
I want you just to think about the area of a square, though.
Let's forget the computer language for a minute, although I do love it.
So, let's look at the area of a triangle.
Can you remember that?
There you go.
You can see how to calculate the area of a triangle.
And you see if the sides are A, B and C exactly how to do that.
And again, all sorts of extra information.
Let's go on to something that's a bit more difficult.
Can you remember the area of a circle?
And there we go.
If the radius is A, the area of a circle is pi A squared or pi radius squared, pi R squared.
Let's do one more.
The area of an ellipse.
Now, believe it or not, we're working our way to understanding the p-value.
So, here we have our major axis, our smaller axis here.
And we see that if that is X and Y, or A and B at least, the area is then pi times A times B.
Simple enough.
All sorts of extra information.
Let's try one.
Let's try one more.
Alpha.
Well, from Alpha query, I'm going to say, what is the area of a trapezoid?
Oh, let's see if it can do that.
And there you go.
If those are the areas of the trapezoid, there is your equation for the area of a trapezoid.
All sorts of extra information once again.
Let's bring it back to a p-value, though.
Believe it or not, the most important shape that we are going to deal with here is the area of a rectangle.
Now, that's quite simple.
Let's see what it is.
And there you go.
If we have sides A and B, the area of a rectangle is just A times B.
Very, very simple.
Let's move down through all the information we can get from the language.
And now knowing that we are talking about the area of a shape, let me build your intuition for what a p-value is.
And we're going to start off by just taking a simple die, you know, that thing that has six sides.
Imagine you roll it on one of the sides, land up, face up.
So, it has sides with values one to six.
I think most people know a die.
These are discrete values, though.
Discrete meaning I can only roll a one, a two, a three, and a four.
I can't roll a five and a half with a single die.
That doesn't exist.
So, these are discrete values.
And when I take that die and I'm going to roll it 1,000 times, I'm going to simulate that with a very easy piece of code.
As I said, remember, this is not about the code, but this is this little line that you see here.
That's how easy it is.
I'm doing this experiment, rolling a die 10,000 times, and I'm saving it as a computer variable.
Don't worry about that.
The next line of code is what it's all about.
Let's execute that.
And that's called a bar chart.
So, you see at the bottom here, one, two, three, four, five, six.
So, that is what I rolled.
And if I just hover over there, you can see how many times, and this is completely random.
Well, it's actually called pseudo-random, but that's a different story.
I rolled it at random 10,000 times, and it seems I got 1,586 times it landed on one, 1,660 times it landed on two, 1,708 times it landed on three.
What you can notice, though, is that it's, you know, this was random, so it's almost exactly the same.
One more thing I want you to notice is if I added all these values, well, it had to add up to 10,000 because I rolled it 10,000 times.
But let's just express this bar chart as something else, something that looks slightly similar, but actually means something different.
It's called a histogram.
Now, you see this histogram, same sort of thing.
I see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 at the bottom, but instead of the how many times it was, you know, how many times it occurred when I rolled my die,
it says what was the probability of landing on a 3, on a 4, on a 5, on a 6.
Now, let's go back up to one.
You see it was 1,586, and lo and behold, well, let's choose this one.
There we go.
1,660 times the two occurred, and if I go down, I see the probability was 0.166.
Well, that's almost similar.
Well, it seems all I did was I took how many times it occurred, the 1,660, and I divided it by 10,000 because that is the probability of it having landed on two.
And remember the area of a rectangle?
That is just the base times the height.
We looked at that.
That was just A times B.
Now, these are discrete values.
Remember, I can't roll a 5 1⁄2.
So, the base there of the two, what we are saying to ourselves when we are talking about, just go with me here a little bit,
that we are saying that the base is equal to a length of 1.
It is discrete.
Now, even if it was something that was smaller than 1, it being discrete means we take it as a unit length, just 1.
And the height is 0.166 of my probability histogram here, and 0.166 times 1 equals 0.166, and that is the probability, the p-value.
I can ask you, if I rolled it 10,000 times, what was the probability of getting a 2?
Well, it was 0.166, and that was the p-value.
It's the probability of something having happened, having done your experiment.
You notice there, it is simply geometric area.
That is just a p-value.
It is just a geometric area, as simple as that.
Now, let's ram things up a bit, or at least, let's just do something that is not random.
There's actually an equation for what is happening here, and it's called a probability density equation, or probability density function.
It will tell us very nicely what each of these p-values should be.
Now, remember, this was done at random, and everything being equal, all of these should have been exactly the same.
And there's an equation for that.
And it is this equation that we see here, the probability density function.
It says the probability x of hitting anything between a minimum and a maximum, so that's a and b, the minimum that you could roll was a 1, the maximum that you could roll was this b, which was a 6.
So the probability of hitting anything between these, so a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6, was 1 divided by 1 minus a plus b.
So let's just do that.
So it's 1 over 1 minus 1 plus 6, and that is just 1 over 6.
And I can ask Mathematica to express that for me in approximate form, so that's 0.166.
So the p-value for each of these, theoretically, should be 0.166, because there's equal likelihood if there's nothing wrong with my die, or the way I roll it, or the floor it lands on, the table it lands on, that should be the probability.
What I want you to see here, though, is I can create a mathematical equation called the probability density function that allows me not to have to draw this, but to just work out what the probability would be.
And that is, you know, we're going to build on that, and that eventually is the equation from which we get a p-value after doing a normal medical or other kind of study.
Notice that I can develop a function that can represent the solution for me.
Now, let's do something else.
I've still got my die, and now I get another one out.
Now I've got a pair of dice.
Now we can call it dice.
I like saying the word dice as opposed to a die.
That just sounds so weird.
Anyway, so I've got my pair of die, or my pair of my dice, and I'm going to roll them both.
I've got two of them, and I'm going to roll them 10,000 times.
Now I can't do that, but I can ask a mathematician to do that for me, and I've saved in this variable called dice,
and I can say, let's look at the first, what was the first 10 rolls.
And you see, this is called a list of lists.
I rolled a 3 and a 2.
Next, picked it up.
Rolled a 5 and a 1.
Picked it up.
Rolled a 4 and a 3.
Picked it up.
Rolled a 4 and a 1.
Picked it up.
Rolled a 6 and a 1.
Picked it up.
Rolled a 1 and a 6.
Picked it up.
Rolled a 6 and a 5.
That's my first 10 rolls.
Now let's do something.
Let's just add each of these.
So it'll be 3 and 2 is 5.
5 and 1 is 6.
4 and 3 is 7.
4 and 1 is 5, etc.
So I'm just going to total up each of those rolls.
Now, how many?
So, I mean, I could roll a 1 and a 1.
That's 2.
And I can roll a 6 and a 6.
That's 12.
So it goes from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 12.
Now, which one from 2 to 12 do you think occurs most commonly?
I think naturally you would reason to yourself, well, it's, I mean, you've rolled a pair of dice before.
You know that 2 1s or 2 6s at least is very rare to hit 2 6s.
It's much more common to do the others.
So is there some pattern here?
Now, remember, all I did was I rolled two things that have equal likelihood of any of the sides, you know, landing face up.
So, you know, what is going to develop here?
So let's have a quick look.
Let's tally all of these.
And it says I rolled 277 2s, 588 3s, so a bit more, even more 4s, even more 5s, even more 6s, even more 7s.
But when it gets to 8, I start going down again.
And 9 less still, 10 less still, 11 less still, and 12, you know, even less.
So let's do a little bar chart of that and see what happens.
There we go.
There's our bar chart.
And look at that.
Is that not one of the most beautiful, well, this is discrete.
It's not continuous values.
Again, I can't roll a 7 1⁄2.
These are discrete.
But isn't that the most beautiful bell-shaped curve you've ever seen?
So I take two things, and each of them has equal likelihood of occurring.
But if I somehow do something to them, in this instance we add the two values up,
I get this distribution that is beautifully normally distributed.
It's bell-shaped.
And once again, I can express this as a probability.
There we go.
It was 1,687.
And the probability of rolling a 7 was 0.1687.
Just how many times I rolled, it was 10,000.
And I take how many occurred, 1,687 divided by 10,000.
That gives me the p-value.
But notice also, I can ask you, what was the probability of rolling a 12?
Well, it was less than 3%.
It was 2.85%, a p-value of 0.02.
So notice how the sum of all of these add up to 1.
So you can't have something occur like a 13, you know, or a 1.
So it's got a sum.
All these probabilities have got a sum to a 1.
Just as the occurrence of all of these have to sum to 10,000,
the probabilities have to sum to 1.
And I could also say, what was the probability of throwing something that was 10 or more?
Well, I would just add these three.
I would add 0.08, 0.05 there, and 0.285.
I could add all of them.
So I can color in these three at the end.
And I can say, well, I can draw a line down here.
And my probability of a 10 or more would just be the addition of these three.
So again, dealing with discrete values, very easy to calculate a p-value.
It is nothing other than geometric area of rectangles.
Again, discrete, so even though it works out nicely that these are, you know,
the difference between 10 and 11 is just 1.
But because it's discrete, we always take a value of 1 as being the base.
So the base times the height here.
The height here, we can see there clearly.
The height of this little one, for instance, is 0.0285 times 1 equals 0.0285.
And that's the probability.
It's the geometric area of a rectangle, as simple as that.
Now, let's have a look at something that's more continuous,
not the step-size discrete value with a base of 1.
Because we've seen a bell-shaped curve.
It's definitely not step-wise.
It's a smooth curve.
So what do we do there?
I tell you now, it's not a problem.
Let's have a quick look.
Just as I had my equation there for the probability density function
of rolling a discrete uniform distribution,
that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
and each of them has a uniform or equal likelihood of landing face-up,
I can make a probability density, not me,
someone very clever, you know, a while ago,
came up with this equation.
And that's the equation for a normal distribution
with a mean there of mu and a standard deviation of sigma.
And that's what the equation looks like.
One of the most beautiful equations you'll ever see.
And I want to give you some intuition of how this thing looks and works.
So there we go.
I can manipulate how much the mean is.
So I can move the mean around.
First of all, look how beautiful.
That's a beautiful normal distribution and beautiful bell-shaped curve.
And the area, believe it or not, underneath this line,
which goes from all the way to negative infinity,
all the way to positive infinity,
the area of this probability density function,
the area under this curve,
and to really do that we need integral calculus,
you know, not just the area of a rectangle that was simple base times height.
Here's something different.
We need integral calculus.
I'm not going to show you the integral calculus.
I want you to appreciate the fact that the area under this curve is also equal to 1.
And I can also get a little piece here in the corner or wherever,
and I can calculate what the area under the curve is.
Let's just increase the standard deviation a bit.
And you see how it gets flatter, but it gets fatter on the sides.
The tails move out, and they get thicker on the side.
And you can see what the influence is of changing.
Well, the influence of the mean is easy to see.
You know, it just goes left and right.
And then the influence of the standard deviation on the bell-shaped curve there.
If this was exactly 1 and this was exactly 0,
we would call that the standard normal distribution.
Anyway, so I just want you to appreciate the fact
that we can go from discrete values to continuous values.
And most of the time, that is what we are going to look at.
I just want to, I'm going to move away a little bit from what a p-value is
because I'm quite interested just to show you a couple of other distributions.
This is the t-distributions, you know, students t-test.
It's also bell-shaped, but it's slightly different,
and it works not on a mean and standard deviation,
but it works on something called degrees of freedom.
So here we have degrees of freedom of 2 and degrees of freedom of 3.
And you see the 2 there.
You see how the tails get a bit fatter there,
or it gets a bit thinner and it gets pushed up.
But that's the distribution you usually use in a t-distribution.
Not to worry.
Let me just show you the chi-squared distribution.
Chi-squared distribution also works on something called degrees of freedom.
And here we see one with 2, 6, and 20.
And you see a chi-squared distribution with a degrees of freedom of 20
almost has a bell-shaped curve.
But when it gets very small, like a 6-year or the 2-year,
it's certainly not bell-shaped.
Okay.
So now, let's create a population.
And instead of this being 7 billion people,
we imagine we're in a town or some area that services some institution, whatever.
There's 20,000 people.
And imagine there's some blood test.
We call that the value for that blood test.
It's called the variable.
Remember, variables.
And let's just assume that this value that this blood test can take,
so if I were to take all those 20,000 people
and I were to do this blood test on them,
there's an equal likelihood of all of the different values
that are possible being available.
So it's, again, a uniform distribution in the population.
But this blood test has a minimum value,
so the patient that has the lowest value is a 50,
and the patient that has the highest value has a value of 110.
We just chose that.
Now, really, it means if we selected two groups at random from this population,
so the 20,000 that stood in front of me,
and I take 30, and I take another 30,
there shouldn't really be a difference between the two means.
So if I take this 30, and I calculate the mean,
and I take another 30, and I calculate the mean,
and I compare the means,
I mean, there was this equal distribution across the possible values.
So there shouldn't be a difference, should there?
Let's see.
So here's my population.
I'm suggesting what I'm saying to the computer is
take values between 50 and 110 and give me 20,000 of them,
but every value has an equal likelihood of being chosen.
Let's have a look at the histogram, the histogram of that.
And here you see the fact that it is uniform,
so all the values, don't worry about this one over 110,
here's what happens when these graphs are generated.
But I want you to appreciate the fact is that
if I make a little bundle now,
what has changed here,
and what makes this,
the fact that these are not,
you know, it's not one at the bottom anymore,
is that there could be a value of 50.1,
50.2, 50.435, 67.876,
and what we're doing is we're just binning them.
We're saying, well, let's go from 50 to 55 exactly,
and we see how many people were in 50,
had a blood value of between 50 and 55,
and we divide that by the 20,000,
which gives us a probability to fall in that range.
I cannot ask the question any longer,
what was the probability of someone having exactly 50?
Because there could be 50.01, 50.0001,
50.00001 could have been the blood test.
These are now continuous values.
And I have to bin them now.
I have to say between 50 and 55 exactly,
how many people were in there divided by the 25,000
still gives me the probability.
But look at this.
There's an equal probability of landing
in any of these little intervals.
I want you to appreciate that.
Now, once again, I could,
there's a little equation just to say
what the mean is.
And remember, if we look at 110 to 50,
halfway between those two is 80.
So theoretically, it should be 80.
And if I do the theoretical calculation here,
you can see that it is 80.
But for the 20,000 that came at random,
it was about 80.2044.
And you see again there,
you know, the many decimal values.
So we're not talking discrete values anymore.
We've moved away from there.
But there's an equation just to look at
what the theoretical mean should have been
and what our actual mean is.
Now, so bear with me.
I mean, this is crucial
that there's equal likelihood
of any of these little intervals,
you know, of a patient falling
in any of these little intervals.
It's not that one occurs more commonly
than the other.
Now what I want to do
is something similar to rolling
those, those, the pair of dice.
I'm going to take,
I'm going to do a very simplified study.
I'm going to take two people
at random from the 20,000.
And I'm going to look at
what each of their blood value is.
And I'm just going to,
instead of adding them,
I'm going to look at what the average is.
So one had a blood value of 50.8
and the other one had a blood value
of 104.786.
I add them together.
I divide them by two.
And I see, you know,
what was, what was the average.
And I, and I take my two people
and I calculate that average
and I write it down.
And let's imagine,
I throw those two people back
in the bunch of 20,000.
Now I, I select two again.
Might be, might be that,
you know, I picked the same two
or one of the two is the same,
but there's 20,000.
Probability is I'm going to pick,
you know, two other people.
And I just do this 25 times over.
And every time,
every one of those 25 times,
I calculate the average
of the two that I took.
And now let's have a look
at what happens
to the distribution
of these averages.
I mean, intuitively,
you should think,
well, it should just be flat.
Like this curve is flat.
Because everything is equally likely.
So if I were to take two of them
and took the average,
all the averages
should be equally likely.
Hang on a minute.
Let's do that.
Whoa.
What has happened here?
We can see a pattern developing here.
It's almost like
a little bell-shaped curve
wants to come out here.
Now, appreciate this.
It was equally likely
for anything,
you know,
they're all equal,
equal likelihood.
And I just,
at very random,
chose two
and did the average.
But lo and behold,
it seems as if some averages
are more common than others.
Let me prove this to you.
This is called the,
called the central limit theorem.
Now, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take 30 patients
and record the average.
And I'm going to do,
throw them back,
take another 30.
I'm going to do that 500 times.
And each time I'm going to record,
I create an empty list there.
And every time I run through it,
I'm going to run do 500 times.
I'm going to go 500 times,
choose 30,
calculate the average,
spit it out.
Let's have a look at that.
There we go.
So definitely some averages
were more likely to occur
than others.
And this is what happens
when you do research.
You're not going to do it
500 times over.
You are only going to do it once.
You don't have the time and money
to do a study 500 times over.
And that one time that you did it,
you're study.
You got a value.
Some values should occur
more commonly than others.
Some should occur
rather rarely.
And that is our p-value.
What was the probability
of finding that one that you did?
And look at this.
This is based on the fact that
there wasn't this skewed
distribution of this value
in our population
to start off with.
It was very equal.
It was very equal.
So I, you know,
I didn't do anything
behind the scenes
to cheat the system
and force the fact
that I'm going to get these.
People were equally distributed here.
And still I get this
bell-shaped curve out.
Now, again,
I can use that beautiful equation
I showed you up above.
And I'm going to calculate the mean
and not the standard deviation,
but what we have to use
is the standard error.
And let's just look
at this distribution here,
which I've, you know,
I've grouped people
into little bins.
So little intervals there.
Let's do it smoothly
so I can just show you
what the theoretical distribution
looks like.
And there we go.
Beautiful, beautiful
bell distribution.
And you could do your study
that 30 that you picked
to land it there.
And so say land it here.
I hope you can see my cursor.
I can now ask the question,
what was the probability
of the group that I got,
the average being this value
or higher?
That will be the area
I can draw a straight line down
and the line towards the side
and this little funny shaped
area, I mean,
it's like a triangle,
but there's a curve
to the one side.
So I can't use the equation
for the area of a triangle.
I've got to use
integral calculus
and it can calculate
this area under the curve.
And I could say,
well, the probability
of having found
a mean of my three patients
of so much was
of so much and more.
Remember, this is not discrete.
I cannot ask the question,
what was the probability
of getting an average
of 80.5?
I can say 80.5
or higher
or 80.5 and lower.
And that means
I draw a line up
at 85 here
and I check
what was the area
under the curve
to the left
or the area
under the curve
to the right.
But it's the same principle
as those rolling
of the two die.
It's just area
under the curve.
Now, let's just go
one final step here
and relate it to something
that you would actually do.
So you would take
two groups
of 30 people
and you would compare
the means
one against the other.
So I would take
two people
30 values
on one side
30 values
on the other side.
I get a mean
on this side.
I get a mean
on that side.
I subtract
the means
from each other
and now I want
to see
is there a difference
in the means.
And this is what
I've done
in this line of code.
So I've done that
and lo and behold
I still get
this nice distribution
but now it's around 0.
0 is more
around the 0 area.
I can't ask
exactly 0, remember.
Around 0
the difference
of 0
in the means
between the groups
should occur
more commonly.
So if it comes out here
towards this side
I can ask
5, 6, 7, 8, 9
so what is the
probability of getting
a difference
and means
between my two
randomly selected
groups of 30 people
what is it
to get
a difference
of means
of say
9 or more.
Well I would just
add these
but once again
we won't do it
in this blocky form
we can use
the actual
equations
theoretical equations
that we have
for that
and there's
our beautiful
curve
now it's not
going to be
exactly around 0
because this comes
directly from
my
running my experiment
500 times
but I think
you can appreciate
what is going
on here
that given
that there should
be no difference
given that
some deity
knows that
there's no difference
I can construct
an equation
which will give me
this beautiful
shaped curve
and I run
my study once
and I find
a value
and that means
I can ask
the question
what was
the chances
of finding
my value
or more
than my value
the difference
in my means
or more than
or less than
or different than
doesn't matter
all these questions
but in the end
I draw a little line
my value
my one study
falls somewhere
down here
and I can
get an area
under the curve
towards one of the sides
let me show you
that in these
two little graphs
that I've drawn
here in a different
program
and I just
imported it here
so imagine
then you do
your study
and you take
30 people
in each group
and you know
one group
got a certain
drug
and the other
one not
and you measured
something
and you want
to see
is there a difference
now in these
in the means
between these
two values
and what you
would do
now remember
you can't do
this 10,000
times over
you can only
do this once
but what those
equations will do
is they'll take
the one
that you got
and it'll draw
this theoretical
nice little curve
with a total area
of one underneath
you will then
do the following
you will say
I want a p-value
of 0.05
and the equation
will actually work
out for you
well
if I draw a line
right here
this orange one
and everything
out towards that
this area
is behind the
black
so imagine
the black
wasn't there
so all the
area of the
orange there
that is 0.05
of the area
under the curve
it will work
that out for you
now you'll take
your specific
results
and there's a
little equation
that you do
to mark out
where you will
then put your
dot here on
the x-axis
and it will fall
there
and it will
work out for you
what this area
under the curve
for the black
is which is
obviously here
less than 0.05
so the probability
of you having
found this
specific result
given all the
possible ones
that could occur
theoretically
your p-value
was less than
0.05
now this is called
a one-tailed
hypothesis
most commonly
in research
though we'll have
what is called
a two-tailed
hypothesis
where we say
we think
our null hypothesis
is there's no
difference between
the groups
our alternate
hypothesis is
there is a
difference
so if I subtract
the mean of the
one group from
the other
the one might be
more or less
than the other
one
I'm not saying
specifically beforehand
that I know
and that is really
the way you should
do most research
when you have a
one-tailed
where you say
I definitely know
the second group
should be more
and you have a
one-tailed
hypothesis
you must be able
to logically
explain to your
colleagues who's
reading your
research and
convince them
through logical
arguments that you
should have chosen
the one-tailed
so it's much
more common
to do this
two-tailed
so the two-tailed
says the null
hypothesis is
there should be
no difference
and I think
I've shown you
now the way
that these
things are
constructed
is the fact
that there
was no
difference
there was
an equal
distribution
of a
uniform
distribution
of these
values
it wasn't
like there
was one
lot
you know
more people
had 80
than 50
that was
equally
likely
to have
everything
so the null
the p-value
comes from
the fact
that in reality
there is no
difference between
the two groups
given that fact
you now construct
this nice little
graph that I've
shown you
and some
differences will be
more common
than others
and you just find
one of the
uncommon ones
then you have a
small p-value
that did never
never ever
did this prove
that the one
group was different
from the other
you never prove
that there is no
equation that can
prove that
this is built
from the fact
that there should
be no difference
statistics like
this is built
from the fact
that there should
be no difference
in reality
then given
there is no
difference
some deity
knows there's
no difference
you just found
one that you
should result
that would
less likely
to be found
given that
there is no
difference
and then we
decide
okay we'll
reject the null
hypothesis
and accept
alternate
hypothesis
and say there
is a difference
between the groups
but that's just
something we
decided
we never
proved this
statistics
cannot
this inferential
statistics
cannot prove
this
it is based
on the fact
that underlying
those patients
that you took
there really
is no difference
you then find
a difference
that should be
rare to find
and we call
that oh
okay
oh there is
a difference
between them
well I think
you understand
now you have
a deep intuition
about what a
p-value really
is
it is a
geometric area
based on
the fact
that on
equations that
were developed
for there to
be no
difference
whatsoever
it is just
the fact that
we as humans
have decided
that if we
get one of
these
differences
that is
less likely
to have
occurred
then we'll
call it
significant
and we
had this
cutoff
of 0.05
so just to
get back
to this
so what
we do is
we don't
know if
one is going
to be more
than the other
we actually
draw these
two orange
lines with
slightly further
out
and we
have 0.025
or 2.5%
on the one
side
and 2.5%
on the other
side
and whatever
of these
two black
values we
find
we just
duplicate it
on the other
side
and we just
add the
two black
areas to
each other
so it'll
always be
double
what it
is
so your
p-value
you know
if there's
one way
to cheat
just go
from a
one tail
two tail
to a
one tail
because you
just divide
your p-value
in two
and suddenly
it'll be
much smaller
of course
it'll be
half
and you
can cheat
that way
which you
should never
ever do
and that's
a horrible
horrible
so when you
read a paper
see what
kind of
hypothesis
people chose
one tailed
or two
tailed
alternate
hypothesis
and if
they chose
or if
they don't
say
that with
some
suspicion
and if
they do
say
it was
one tailed
they better
convince you
why the
one tail
should have
been chosen
so we do
this two
tailed
thing
and because
I love
mathematical
let me
just show
you
so I'm
just going
to create
30 people
two groups
30 people
and from
a normal
distribution
I'm going
to choose
a value
with a mean
of 100
and standard
deviation
of 10
and the
other 105
115
let me
just show
you at
random
what happened
here
so the
mean of
my first
group
was 99
0.867
the mean
of my second
group
was 103
I can
ask
you know
let's just
look at a
box and
whisker plot
you know
what those
look like
and I can
ask is there
a statistically
significant
difference
between these
two groups
couple of
a couple of
functions you
can use in
Mathematica
the one is
called the
location test
I do it
there and I
see there's my
t statistic
that is the
little black
line that's
where you draw
your little black
line there
it takes your
values and
converts it
into a point
that you put on
the x-axis
you then reflect it
on the other
side with a
positive as well
and it works
out the p
value for you
0.31
so given
only this
information
it uses
those beautiful
equations that
we saw before
draws that
nice little
bell shape
curve and
it says
well the
difference
between these
two was
minus
well minus
4 something
around there
and that
means on
that x-axis
that will fall
on negative
1.01935
so that's so
many standard
errors away
from zero
don't worry
about that
duplicate it
on the other
side
work out the
area on the
curve and
lo and behold
it says
look buddy
this area
under the
curve was
not so
uncommon
to have
a curve
the difference
in the
means were
not so
uncommon
given all
the possible
ones that
could occur
and let me
just show you
there's another
way to write
the t-test
and say group
A and group
B
very easy
in Mathematica
to get
these p-values
very easy
to do
so I hope
this has
given you
some intuition
about the p-value
of what it
really means
it's just this
geometric area
based on the
fact that
there isn't
any difference
and we are
weird as humans
we just decided
that 0.05
is going to be
this cut off
and then we
think there is
a difference
you've never
proved it
you never
ever ever
proved it
this is just
the way we
constructed
statistics
clever people
constructed
statistics
and I think
we abuse it
so you can
really see
start to
get this
uneasy feeling
about a p-value
and why some
journals are
moving away
from it
and how easy
it is to
cheat with a p-value
and how little
it really means
and there's
some
as you know
there's other
things that we
should look at
when we do
but you're going
to see a lot
of p-values
and you should
know what
it's all about
you
you
you
