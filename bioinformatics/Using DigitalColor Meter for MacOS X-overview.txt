The text provides guidance on how to select colors using the Digital Color Meter program available on Apple systems. This utility helps users find the RGB values of any color by pointing at areas on their screen with a mouse. To use this feature, one can visit a website they like and note down the RGB values of its colors. These values can then be input into design software or websites like Adobe Color (previously known as Kuler) to replicate or integrate those colors into personal designs. This approach allows users to adopt color schemes from existing web designs that appeal to them, even if the original website's overall design isn't considered modern or good by today's standards.
