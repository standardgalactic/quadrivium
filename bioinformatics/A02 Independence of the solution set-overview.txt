The text discusses verifying solutions to a system of linear differential equations using matrix multiplication. It introduces a solution involving matrices, where the derivative of a vector \( X \) (composed of variables like \( X \) and \( Y \)) is represented as a product of a constant matrix \( A \) and the vector \( X \). The example given illustrates that multiplying matrix \( A \) by vector \( X \) yields the correct derivatives, confirming \( A \)'s validity.

The text then explores combining solutions. If two solutions are linearly independent (i.e., not scalar multiples of each other), any constant combination of these solutions also constitutes a valid solution to the homogeneous system. This concept is verified using the Wronskian, a determinant-based test for linear independence: if the Wronskian is non-zero, the solutions are linearly independent.

In summary, verifying matrix multiplication confirms specific solutions to differential equations, and linear combinations of independent solutions provide additional valid solutions, validated through the Wronskian.
