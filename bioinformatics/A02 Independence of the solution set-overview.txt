The text discusses verifying solutions to a system of linear differential equations using matrix multiplication. It introduces a solution involving matrices, where the derivative of a vector \( X \) (composed of variables like \( X \) and \( Y \)) is represented as a product of a constant matrix \( A \) and the vector \( X \). The example given illustrates that multiplying matrix \( A \) by vector \( X \) yields the correct derivatives, confirming \( A \)'s validity.

The text then explores combining solutions. If two solutions are linearly independent (i.e., not scalar multiples of each other), any constant combination of these solutions also constitutes a valid solution to the homogeneous system. This concept is verified using the Wronskian, a determinant-based test for linear independence: if the Wronskian is non-zero, the solutions are linearly independent.

In summary, verifying matrix multiplication confirms specific solutions to differential equations, and linear combinations of independent solutions provide additional valid solutions, validated through the Wronskian.

The text explains how to verify and solve a system of linear differential equations using matrix multiplication. It begins by introducing a solution in the form \( X' = AX \), where \( X \) is a vector of variables and \( A \) is a constant matrix. By multiplying matrix \( A \) with vector \( X \), you obtain a set of linear differential equations that need to be solved simultaneously.

The text provides an example, showing that if \( X \) consists of components like \( e^{-2t} \) and \(-e^{-2t}\), the solution will satisfy these equations. It verifies this by performing matrix multiplication, resulting in expressions for derivatives which match the expected outcomes.

Furthermore, it discusses how combining two solutions linearly (using constants) forms another valid solution to the homogeneous system if they are linearly independent. Linear independence is verified using the Wronskian determinant: as long as the determinant formed by these solutions does not equal zero, the solutions are considered linearly independent, allowing for a complete set of solutions through their linear combinations.

In summary, the process involves verifying initial solutions via matrix operations and ensuring that any additional solutions are valid and add value only if they are linearly independent.
