We continue our look into hernias and in this lecture a very short look at the physiology.
Now the physiology is about the abdominal cavity itself and this muscular covering of the abdominal
cavity is an oval cylinder. In the top we have a diaphragm and in the bottom a pelvic floor.
What is it there for? Well it contains and protects the vital abdominal organs and it
also provides attachments to these organs with natural openings for structures to move through
this cavity and all of these things combine to form natural areas or abnormal areas that are
defects through which internal abdominal organs can protrude to the external world and that is a hernia.
