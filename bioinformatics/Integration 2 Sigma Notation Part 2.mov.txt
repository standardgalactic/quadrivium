A very important aspect of sigma notation is the algebraic rules for finite sums.
They are the sum, difference, constant multiple and constant value rules.
The sum rule is applied when the element contains an addition, each with one or more k variables.
The same applies to the difference rule, except for the fact that there is subtraction.
In the constant multiple rule, the constant can be removed from the sigma notation.
Here the 4 is brought outside the sigma notation.
The constant value rule needs particular attention.
If the sole entry in the element is a constant, the answer is given by multiplying that constant
with the upper value of k, in other words n.
In the example here, it is 4 times 3 and that equals 12.
Here is a sneaky example.
Simply stick to the rules though.
1 over n is a constant and the upper value of k is n.
That gives 1 over n times n and that is 1.
Some means 2.
You can do êµ¬ reservoir cuz it is a constant and so on Italy.
Now we can do is control
your strength and, in the order of a stature.
We can use a duration, switch to the strength,
with both structures.
Okay.
What object then did it that this is a pinch and support?
This is the upright movement, right?
This is atimer, right?
I am just the camel.
