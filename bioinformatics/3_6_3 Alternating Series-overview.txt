The text discusses how to determine whether a series converges or diverges using specific tests and examples.

1. **First Series Example:**
   - The series is \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4(-1)^{k+1}}{\sqrt{k}}\).
   - This is an alternating series.
   - To test for convergence, the text uses a disguised version of the \(n\)th term test. They consider the absolute value of the terms: \(a_k = \frac{8}{\sqrt{k}}\).
   - The limit of \(a_k\) as \(k\) approaches infinity is 0.
   - Additionally, it's shown that \(a_{k+1} < a_k\), confirming the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.

2. **Second Series Example:**
   - The series is \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1} 4^k}{k^2}\).
   - The sequence of terms \(a_k = \frac{4^k}{k^2}\) is considered.
   - Using L'HÃ´pital's Rule on the function \(f(x) = \frac{4^x}{x^2}\), it's shown that the limit as \(x\) approaches infinity is infinite, indicating divergence.

3. **Error in Partial Sums:**
   - For an alternating series, the error \(|S - S_n|\) is less than or equal to \(a_{n+1}\).
   - To find when the error is no more than \(\frac{1}{10,000}\), solve for \(n\) such that \(\frac{2}{n+1} \leq \frac{1}{10,000}\).
   - Solving gives \(n \geq 19,999\). However, since the error must be strictly less than \(\frac{1}{10,000}\), \(n\) should be at least 20,000.

The text emphasizes understanding the requirements of convergence tests and correctly interpreting conditions for errors in partial sums.
