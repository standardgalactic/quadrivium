The text discusses how to determine whether a series converges or diverges using specific tests and examples.

1. **First Series Example:**
   - The series is \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4(-1)^{k+1}}{\sqrt{k}}\).
   - This is an alternating series.
   - To test for convergence, the text uses a disguised version of the \(n\)th term test. They consider the absolute value of the terms: \(a_k = \frac{8}{\sqrt{k}}\).
   - The limit of \(a_k\) as \(k\) approaches infinity is 0.
   - Additionally, it's shown that \(a_{k+1} < a_k\), confirming the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.

2. **Second Series Example:**
   - The series is \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1} 4^k}{k^2}\).
   - The sequence of terms \(a_k = \frac{4^k}{k^2}\) is considered.
   - Using L'Hôpital's Rule on the function \(f(x) = \frac{4^x}{x^2}\), it's shown that the limit as \(x\) approaches infinity is infinite, indicating divergence.

3. **Error in Partial Sums:**
   - For an alternating series, the error \(|S - S_n|\) is less than or equal to \(a_{n+1}\).
   - To find when the error is no more than \(\frac{1}{10,000}\), solve for \(n\) such that \(\frac{2}{n+1} \leq \frac{1}{10,000}\).
   - Solving gives \(n \geq 19,999\). However, since the error must be strictly less than \(\frac{1}{10,000}\), \(n\) should be at least 20,000.

The text emphasizes understanding the requirements of convergence tests and correctly interpreting conditions for errors in partial sums.

The text discusses how to determine whether certain series are convergent or divergent using various mathematical tests and techniques.

1. **Series Convergence Tests**:
   - The first example involves an alternating series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4(-1)^{k+1}}{\sqrt{k}}\). To determine convergence, the text applies the Alternating Series Test (also known as Leibniz's test), which requires:
     - The absolute value of terms \(b_k = \frac{4}{\sqrt{k}}\) must decrease monotonically.
     - The limit of \(b_k\) as \(k\) approaches infinity must be zero. Both conditions are satisfied, indicating the series is convergent.

2. **Ratio and Limit Comparison**:
   - For another alternating series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1} 4^k}{k^2}\), the text examines the limit of the sequence \(a_k = \frac{4^k}{k^2}\) as \(k\) approaches infinity. By applying L'Hôpital's rule to the function \(f(x) = \frac{4^x}{x^2}\), it is shown that the limit does not exist (or diverges to infinity). Thus, the series diverges because the sequence terms do not approach zero.

3. **Error Estimation in Alternating Series**:
   - The text explains how to find the number of partial sums needed for an error less than a given value using another alternating series. For \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\), it determines that to ensure an error less than \(0.0001\) (or \(1/10,000\)), at least 20,000 terms are needed. This is because the error in an alternating series approximation by the \(n\)-th partial sum is bounded by the absolute value of the \((n+1)\)-th term.

Overall, the text illustrates techniques for analyzing series convergence and estimating errors in approximations using alternating series properties.
