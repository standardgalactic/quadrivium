Welcome to this lecture series on perioperative management. My name is Jean Klopper and I'm a
senior lecturer here at the University of Cape Town. Now whether you're a student or seasoned
professional, medical or nursing, I hope you find this lecture series useful. In the first week I
want to look at pre-operative evaluation. What about the patient with cardio conditions or
pulmonic conditions? What to do with a diabetic? What if someone takes anticoagulation? In the
second week I want to move to the direct perioperative period. We want to look at
fluid administration. How to decide on use of blood and blood products? What to do
with prophylaxis? And in the final week we'll discuss complications, wound
infections, ileus, nosocomial infections such as pneumonias and UTIs. Please enjoy.
Thank you.
