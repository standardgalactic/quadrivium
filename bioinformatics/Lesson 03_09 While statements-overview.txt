The text explains how a `while` loop functions in programming. It outlines the process of setting up and executing a loop using an integer variable `i`, initialized with the value 1. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5. Each iteration prints the current value of `i` and increments it by 1 using shorthand notation (`i += 1`). This process repeats until `i` becomes greater than 5, at which point the loop exits. Unlike a `for` loop where variables are confined within the loop's scope, `i` in this case exists outside the loop's block, allowing its value to persist after the loop concludes. The text emphasizes that using shorthand notation is not algebraic but a common practice across programming languages for simplicity and clarity. This control flow structure enables the execution of code blocks multiple times based on a condition, showcasing the power and flexibility of loops in coding.
