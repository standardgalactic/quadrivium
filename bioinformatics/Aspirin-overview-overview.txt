The text examines how aspirin affects surgical outcomes. High-dose aspirin users (over 100 mg/day) are at increased risk for perioperative bleeding, needing more transfusions, reoperations, and longer hospital stays. In contrast, low-dose users (under 100 mg/day) may experience more blood loss during surgery but don't generally require additional interventions or extended stays. Preoperative bleeding time isn’t linked to these outcomes.

For elective surgeries, it's advised to stop aspirin 5-7 days beforehand if feasible. Aspirin doesn't need to be stopped for minor emergencies, but in major ones—especially where excessive bleeding is a concern like neurosurgery—additional measures such as administering platelets and desmopressin may be necessary to reduce risks.
