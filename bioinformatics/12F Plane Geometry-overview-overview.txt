The text provides methods for deriving parametric equations of lines under different scenarios:

1. **Line through a Point and Parallel to a Vector**: 
   - Given a point \( P_0 \) with coordinates \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) and a direction vector \( n = (2, 1, 3) \), the line can be expressed parametrically as:
     - \( x = x_0 + 2T \)
     - \( y = y_0 + T \)
     - \( z = z_0 + 3T \)
   - This form is achieved by ensuring that another point on the line, \( P \), satisfies \(\overrightarrow{P_0P} = T \cdot n\).

2. **Intersection of Two Planes**:
   - To find the parametric equation of a line at the intersection of two planes, use linear algebra to solve the system.
   - Start with an augmented matrix from plane equations and apply Gauss-Jordan elimination to reach reduced row echelon form.
   - The steps include creating leading 1s, eliminating coefficients below these 1s, and performing back substitution for simplification.
   - With three unknowns (x, y, z) but only two independent equations, one variable is set as a parameter \( T \), resulting in:
     - \( x = -12 - 7T \)
     - \( y = -41 - 23T \)

The text outlines these algebraic techniques to express lines through specified points and directions or as intersections of planes using parametric equations.
