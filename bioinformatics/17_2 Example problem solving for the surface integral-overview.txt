The text describes the process of evaluating a surface integral over a portion of a cone defined by \( Z = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \) with \( Z \) ranging from 1 to 2. The function for integration is given as \( F(X, Y, Z) = (X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2)^{1/2} \).

To evaluate the surface integral, the differential area element \( dS \) on the cone's surface is calculated using:

\[ 
dS = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial X}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial Y}\right)^2 + 1} \, dA 
\]

where the partial derivatives are:

- \( \frac{\partial Z}{\partial X} = \frac{X}{\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}} \)
- \( \frac{\partial Z}{\partial Y} = \frac{Y}{\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}} \)

Substituting these into the formula for \( dS \) yields:

\[ 
dS = \sqrt{2} \, dA 
\]

The function \( F(X, Y, Z) \) is expressed in terms of \( R \) and \( \theta \) using polar coordinates transformations: 

- \( X = R \cos(\theta) \)
- \( Y = R \sin(\theta) \)

Thus, the integrand becomes:

\[ 
F(R, \theta) = \sqrt{R^2 + R^2} = R\sqrt{2}
\]

The region of integration in polar coordinates is defined by \( 1 \leq R \leq 2 \) and \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \).

The integral becomes:

\[ 
2 \int_0^{2\pi} \int_1^2 R^2 \cdot R \, dR \, d\theta = 2 \int_0^{2\pi} \int_1^2 R^3 \, dR \, d\theta
\]

Evaluating the integral:

1. Integrate with respect to \( R \):

   \[
   \int_1^2 R^3 \, dR = \left[\frac{R^4}{4}\right]_1^2 = \frac{16}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{15}{4}
   \]

2. Integrate with respect to \( \theta \):

   \[
   2 \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{15}{4} \, d\theta = \frac{30}{4} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{60\pi}{4} = 15\pi
   \]

Thus, the value of the surface integral is \( 15\pi \).

The text describes a person reflecting on their calculation of surface integrals. Initially, they mistakenly integrated from 0 to 2 instead of the correct limits from 1 to 2, which affected their result. Correcting this, they recalculated and found that the integral should be \(8 - 1 = 7\). This adjustment led them to a final answer of \(\frac{28}{3\pi}\), which they noted looks much better than before.
