Here's a summarized explanation of the guidance provided for solving complex number problems manually:

1. **Finding Roots of Complex Numbers:**
   - To find roots, convert the complex number to polar form using its modulus (e.g., \( |z| = \sqrt{2} \) for \( z = 1 + i \)) and argument (\( \theta \), e.g., \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) for \( z = 1+i \)).
   - Use the formula for complex roots: 
     \[
     z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} \left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right)\right)
     \]
   - For square roots (\( n=2 \)), compute for \( k=0 \) and \( k=1 \), resulting in angles like \( \frac{\pi}{8} \) and \( \frac{9\pi}{8} \).

2. **Expressing Roots in Polar Form:**
   - Express results using polar form, utilizing known angle values to simplify calculations without needing exact trigonometric values.

3. **Complex Number Calculations Using Euler's Formula:**
   - Convert expressions like \( z = 3e^{3} e^{i\pi} \) into polar form (\( r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)).
   - For \( r=3 \), \( \cos\pi=-1 \), and \( \sin\pi=0 \), the result is a real part of -3 and an imaginary part of 0.

4. **Complex Conjugates:**
   - To find the conjugate, change the sign of the imaginary component.
   - For example, if \( \overline{z} = -3e^{-2\pi i} \), then \( z = -3e^{2\pi i} \).
   - This results in a real part of -3 and an imaginary part of 0.

Overall, the text emphasizes understanding transformations between different forms of complex numbers to perform calculations manually without relying on calculators.
