The text describes a scenario involving an electromagnetic wave propagating through a vacuum along the x-axis, originating from a point source with a frequency of \(4 \times 10^{14}\) Hz. The electric field component is directed along the y-axis and has a value at time \(t_0\) that is a quarter of its maximum amplitude, decreasing over time.

The task is to find how far in both the negative and positive x-directions from a point \(x_0\), where the electric field is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of its maximum, it will be zero again at \(t = 0\). 

To solve this, we use the wave equation for the electric field:

\[ e = e_{max} \sin(kx - \omega t) \]

At time \(t_0\) (which is effectively \(t = 0\) here), the condition simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4}e_{max} = e_{max} \sin(kx_0) \]

This implies:

\[ \sin(kx_0) = \frac{1}{4} \]

The wave number \(k\) is given by:

\[ k = \frac{2\pi f}{c} \]

where \(f\) is the frequency and \(c\) is the speed of light. 

To find \(x_0\), we solve:

\[ x_0 = \frac{c}{2\pi f} \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \]

Calculating this gives \(x_0 \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-8}\) meters.

To find where the electric field is zero, we set:

\[ 0 = e_{max} \sin(kx) \]

This occurs when:

\[ kx = n\pi \quad (n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots) \]

Solving for \(x\) gives:

\[ x = \frac{n\pi c}{2\pi f} = \frac{nc}{2f} \]

For the first zero in the negative direction (\(n = -1\)) and positive direction (\(n = 1\)), we find:

- Negative direction: \(x_{negative} = x_0 - \frac{c}{2f}\)
- Positive direction: \(x_{positive} = x_0 + \frac{c}{2f}\)

These calculations provide the distances from \(x_0\) where the electric field first becomes zero in both directions.

The text discusses solving a problem involving scientific notation and subtraction. It starts with the value \(3.75 \times 10^{-7}\) meters, then describes subtracting this from a positive "x" value that results in zero, yielding a width of approximately 345 nanometers (since \(1\) meter = \(10^9\) nanometers). The emphasis is on understanding how to interpret and solve problems using graphs or equations by thoroughly thinking through the implications. The solution highlights the ease of solving such problems with proper comprehension.
