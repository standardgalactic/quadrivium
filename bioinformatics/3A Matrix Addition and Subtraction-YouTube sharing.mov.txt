As mentioned, matrices can be mathematical objects in their own right.
As such, we must be able to add two matrices and subtract them from each other as well.
Let's start with two matrices, A and B.
Both are 2x2 matrices. They both have two rows and two columns.
Now consider the new matrix, matrix A plus B.
We simply add elements from the same addresses.
The A in row 1 column 1 in matrix A, and the E in row 1 column 1 in matrix B are added.
This will give us the value of the element in row 1 column 1 in the new matrix, that is matrix A plus B.
Now, let us look at an example of multiplication.
Not in its true more complex form, but simply as a scalar, which is just a number, times a matrix.
So that we can understand subtraction better.
Here we have a negative 1 times matrix B.
All we do is to multiply negative 1 by each element of the matrix.
Now we subtract matrix B from A, or just add negative matrix B to matrix A.
Now what about adding matrix C to matrix A?
As we can see this is undefined.
There is simply no corresponding address in matrix A for the K for instance in matrix C.
Matrices must be of the same size to be able to add and subtract them.
Lastly, it is easy to see that B minus A will not necessarily be the same as A minus B.
Pinus B is there.
So that we should do everything that has a certain length.
Then you can take and bump into A.
