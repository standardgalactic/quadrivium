This summary outlines the process of solving second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients, expressed as \( ay'' + by' + cy = 0 \). The key steps are:

1. **Equation Form**: The equation involves constants \( a, b, \) and \( c \), with \( a \neq 0 \).

2. **Characteristic Solution**: Solutions involve exponential functions \( e^{mx} \), which maintain their form upon differentiation.

3. **Auxiliary Equation**: Substituting \( y = e^{mx} \) leads to the characteristic equation: \( am^2 + bm + c = 0 \).

4. **Solving the Quadratic**: The roots \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are found using:
   \[
   m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

5. **Root Types**:
   - **Real and Distinct Roots**: If \( b^2 - 4ac > 0 \), solutions are \( y = C_1 e^{m_1 x} + C_2 e^{m_2 x} \).
   - **Repeated Real Roots**: If \( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \), the solution is \( y = (C_1 + C_2 x) e^{mx} \).
   - **Complex Conjugate Roots**: If \( b^2 - 4ac < 0 \), solutions are:
     \[
     y = e^{\alpha x} (C_1 \cos(\beta x) + C_2 \sin(\beta x))
     \]
   where roots are \( m_{1,2} = \alpha \pm i\beta \).

The summary highlights the importance of recognizing these solution forms to effectively solve such differential equations.
