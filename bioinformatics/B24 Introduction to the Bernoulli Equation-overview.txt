The text discusses Bernoulli's equation and explores its characteristics under specific conditions. It identifies two special cases based on the value of \( n \):

1. **When \( n = 0 \):** The equation simplifies to a linear form because \( y^n \) becomes 1, reducing it to \( y' + p(x)y = f(x) \). This is recognized as a standard linear differential equation.

2. **When \( n = 1 \):** The equation transforms into another linear form, specifically a homogeneous one, since the term involving \( f(x)y \) cancels out with the \( p(x)y \), resulting in \( y' + (p(x) - f(x))y = 0 \). This can be rewritten as \( y' + q(x)y = 0 \).

For Bernoulli's equation to remain non-linear and necessitate substitution, neither \( n \) nor \( m \) should equal 0 or 1. In cases where \( n \neq 0 \) and \( n \neq 1 \), the equation is considered a true Bernoulli's equation.

To solve it, the text suggests using the substitution \( y = u^{1-n} \). This transformation helps convert the non-linear differential equation into a linear one, which can then be solved more straightforwardly.
