Here's a summary of the provided text on Taylor's expansion applied to multivariable functions:

### Overview

The text introduces Taylor series for multivariable functions, focusing on key components like vector \(\mathbf{x}\), vector \(\mathbf{p}\) (the point around which the function is expanded), and the gradient operator \(\nabla\).

### Key Points

1. **Taylor Expansion Basics**:
   - Involves summing terms with powers of vectors \((\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p})\) and derivatives up to a certain order.
   - The gradient operator \(\nabla\) is used for partial derivatives in multiple dimensions.

2. **First Order (Local Linearization)**:
   - At first order (\(k = 1\)), the expansion simplifies to local linearization.
   - This involves evaluating the function at point \(\mathbf{p}\) and adding the dot product of \((\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p})\) with the gradient at \(\mathbf{p}\).

3. **Example**:
   - Uses \(f(x, y) = e^x \ln(y)\), expanding around \(\mathbf{p} = (0, 1)\).
   - At \(k = 0\), the function value at \(\mathbf{p}\) is zero.
   - For \(k = 1\), compute gradient components and their dot product with \((\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p})\) for linear approximation.

4. **Higher Order Terms**:
   - Involves more complex calculations, including additional derivatives and vector combinations.
   - Emphasizes understanding the role of dot products in these expansions.

5. **Conceptual Insight**:
   - Local linearization is identified as the first-order Taylor polynomial.
   - Higher-order terms provide better approximations further from \(\mathbf{p}\).

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Vector Dot Product**: Understanding components involved in vector multiplication is crucial for dot products in expansions.

2. **Partial Derivatives**:
   - Compute partial derivatives of \(f(x, y)\).
   - For \(x\), the derivative is \(e^{x \ln(y)}\); substituting \(\mathbf{p} = (0, 1)\) results in zero.
   - For \(y\), the derivative is \((y-1) e^{x \ln(y)}\).

3. **Higher Order Calculations**:
   - Factorials appear as coefficients (e.g., dividing by \(2!\)).
   - Vector notation and dot products are essential for second-order derivatives.
   - Expressions include terms like \(X^2 D_1^2 f(p)\), \(2X(Y-1)D_1D_2f(p)\), \((Y-1)^2 D_2^2 f(p)\).
   - Simplify by multiplying the entire expression by \(\frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Iterative Differentiation**:
   - Compute first and second derivatives with respect to \(x\), treating \(y\) as constant.
   - Substitute values into these derivatives, maintaining certain terms as constants.

This summary encapsulates the process of applying Taylor's expansion to multivariable functions, highlighting both conceptual insights and detailed computational steps.
