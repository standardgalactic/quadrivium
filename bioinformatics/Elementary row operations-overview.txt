It looks like you're working through solving a system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination or a similar method to reduce it into row-echelon form and solve for the variables step by step. Here's a breakdown based on your description:

### Original System
You start with three equations in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
1. \(2x + y + z = 5\)
2. \(0x + 3y + 15z = 21\)
3. \(0x + 0y + z = 1\)

### Solving Step-by-Step

#### Step 1: Solve for \(z\)
From the third equation:
\[ z = 1 \]

#### Step 2: Substitute and Simplify
Substitute \(z = 1\) into the second equation to solve for \(y\):
\[ 0x + 3y + 15(1) = 21 \]
\[ 3y + 15 = 21 \]
\[ 3y = 6 \]
\[ y = 2 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
Now, substitute both \(z = 1\) and \(y = 2\) into the first equation to solve for \(x\):
\[ 2x + (2) + (1) = 5 \]
\[ 2x + 3 = 5 \]
\[ 2x = 2 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

### Final Solution
The solutions are:
- \(x = 1\)
- \(y = 2\)
- \(z = 1\)

This process of solving the system involves reducing it into a form where back substitution can be easily applied, starting from the bottom equation and working upwards. Your steps reflect this approach, with operations to eliminate variables systematically until each variable is isolated.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of solving a system of linear equations using elementary row operations, specifically Gauss-Jordan elimination. It starts by transforming the initial system into an augmented matrix and performing operations to simplify it. The steps involve scaling rows (e.g., dividing by 3) and adding or subtracting rows to eliminate variables systematically.

The goal is to reach a form where each variable can be easily identified—this is achieved when the matrix reaches reduced row-echelon form. The explanation highlights the logical process of maintaining equality on both sides of the equations during transformations, ensuring that operations performed on one side are mirrored on the other.

Additionally, the text mentions using Mathematica software to verify the solution by plotting the planes represented by the original equations and performing matrix operations like row reduction to confirm the solution. The final result is identifying the values \( x = 1 \), \( y = 2 \), and \( z = 1 \) as the solution to the system.

The overall aim of this explanation is not only to solve the specific system but also to illustrate how linear algebra concepts like row operations can be applied more generally, encouraging further exploration into matrices beyond their role in systems of equations.

It looks like you're working through solving a system of linear equations using row operations to convert it into an upper triangular form or row-echelon form. Let's break down what you've described and ensure everything aligns correctly.

You have three equations:

1. \(2x + y + z = 5\)
2. \(0x + 3y + 15z = 21\)
3. \(0x + 0y + z = 1\) (after simplification)

From equation 3, we directly find:
\[ z = 1 \]

Substitute \( z = 1 \) into the second equation:
\[ 0x + 3y + 15(1) = 21 \]
\[ 3y + 15 = 21 \]
\[ 3y = 6 \]
\[ y = 2 \]

Now, substitute \( y = 2 \) and \( z = 1 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 5 \]
\[ 2x + 3 = 5 \]
\[ 2x = 2 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Thus, the solution to the system is:
\[ x = 1, \, y = 2, \, z = 1 \]

The row operations you described align with this process. You used elimination to simplify the equations and solve for each variable step-by-step. Your approach of clearing terms and isolating variables was correct, leading you to the solution efficiently.

The text explains a method for solving a system of linear equations using elementary row operations, specifically Gauss-Jordan elimination, to reach row reduced form (RREF). Here’s a summary:

1. **Row Operations**: The process involves manipulating the coefficients of variables in equations by multiplying, dividing, and adding rows, aiming to simplify them to make solving easier.

2. **Example Solution**:
   - Initial system: 
     \[
     x + y + 3z = 6 \\
     2x + y + z = 5 \\
     x + 2y + z = 6
     \]
   - Through row operations (multiplying/dividing rows by constants, adding/subtracting rows), the system is reduced to a simpler form where:
     \[
     x = 1, \quad y = 2, \quad z = 1
     \]

3. **Verification with Mathematica**:
   - The solution was verified using Mathematica by plotting the equations and observing their intersection at (1, 2, 1).
   - An augmented matrix representation of the system was created and row reduced to confirm the solution.

4. **Focus on Matrices**: After solving linear systems, the text suggests viewing matrices independently as mathematical objects rather than just tools for solving equations.

The explanation emphasizes understanding both the algebraic manipulation process and the conceptual role of matrices in linear algebra.
