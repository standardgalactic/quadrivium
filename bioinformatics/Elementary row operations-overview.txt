It looks like you're working through solving a system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination or a similar method to reduce it into row-echelon form and solve for the variables step by step. Here's a breakdown based on your description:

### Original System
You start with three equations in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
1. \(2x + y + z = 5\)
2. \(0x + 3y + 15z = 21\)
3. \(0x + 0y + z = 1\)

### Solving Step-by-Step

#### Step 1: Solve for \(z\)
From the third equation:
\[ z = 1 \]

#### Step 2: Substitute and Simplify
Substitute \(z = 1\) into the second equation to solve for \(y\):
\[ 0x + 3y + 15(1) = 21 \]
\[ 3y + 15 = 21 \]
\[ 3y = 6 \]
\[ y = 2 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
Now, substitute both \(z = 1\) and \(y = 2\) into the first equation to solve for \(x\):
\[ 2x + (2) + (1) = 5 \]
\[ 2x + 3 = 5 \]
\[ 2x = 2 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

### Final Solution
The solutions are:
- \(x = 1\)
- \(y = 2\)
- \(z = 1\)

This process of solving the system involves reducing it into a form where back substitution can be easily applied, starting from the bottom equation and working upwards. Your steps reflect this approach, with operations to eliminate variables systematically until each variable is isolated.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of solving a system of linear equations using elementary row operations, specifically Gauss-Jordan elimination. It starts by transforming the initial system into an augmented matrix and performing operations to simplify it. The steps involve scaling rows (e.g., dividing by 3) and adding or subtracting rows to eliminate variables systematically.

The goal is to reach a form where each variable can be easily identifiedâ€”this is achieved when the matrix reaches reduced row-echelon form. The explanation highlights the logical process of maintaining equality on both sides of the equations during transformations, ensuring that operations performed on one side are mirrored on the other.

Additionally, the text mentions using Mathematica software to verify the solution by plotting the planes represented by the original equations and performing matrix operations like row reduction to confirm the solution. The final result is identifying the values \( x = 1 \), \( y = 2 \), and \( z = 1 \) as the solution to the system.

The overall aim of this explanation is not only to solve the specific system but also to illustrate how linear algebra concepts like row operations can be applied more generally, encouraging further exploration into matrices beyond their role in systems of equations.
