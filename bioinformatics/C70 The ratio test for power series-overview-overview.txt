The text outlines a method for finding the interval of convergence for a power series using the Ratio Test. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Objective**: Identify where a power series converges.
2. **Method**: Use the Ratio Test, which involves calculating the limit of the absolute value of consecutive terms as \( n \) approaches infinity.
3. **Process**:
   - Formulate and simplify the ratio of successive terms using algebraic techniques.
   - Factor out terms that do not depend on \( n\).
   - Apply L'HÃ´pital's Rule to resolve indeterminate forms, if necessary.

4. **Result**: 
   - The series converges when the simplified expression is less than 1.
   - This results in the inequality \( |x - 3| < 2 \), which translates to the interval \( 1 < x < 5 \).

5. **Endpoint Testing**:
   - Examine convergence at the endpoints \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \) separately, as the Ratio Test does not provide information about these points.

6. **Conclusion**: The series converges within the interval \( (1, 5) \), with additional testing needed to determine behavior at the boundaries.
