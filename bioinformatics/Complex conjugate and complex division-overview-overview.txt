The text provides a detailed explanation of how to divide two complex numbers using an example and outlines the steps involved:

### Steps for Dividing Complex Numbers

1. **Identify the Complex Numbers**: For division, you have \( z_1 = a + bi \) as the numerator and \( z_2 = c + di \) as the denominator.

2. **Multiply by the Conjugate of the Denominator**:
   - Find the conjugate of \( z_2 \): \( \overline{z_2} = c - di \).
   - Multiply both the numerator and denominator by this conjugate to eliminate the imaginary part from the denominator.

3. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - The expression becomes:
     \[
     \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}
     \]
   - The denominator simplifies to a real number: \( c^2 + d^2 \).

4. **Expand the Numerator**:
   - Expand using distributive property:
     \[
     (a + bi)(c - di) = ac - adi + bci - bdi^2
     \]
   - Simplify to get real and imaginary parts: 
     \[
     = ac + bd + (bc - ad)i
     \]

5. **Combine and Divide**:
   - The expression is:
     \[
     \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}
     \]
   - Separate into real and imaginary components:
     \[
     = \frac{ac + bd}{c^2 + d^2} + \frac{bc - ad}{c^2 + d^2}i
     \]

### Example Calculation

- **Given**: \( z_1 = 3 + 4i \) and \( z_2 = 1 + i \).
- **Conjugate of \( z_2 \)**: \( \overline{z_2} = 1 - i \).

**Calculation**:

\[
\frac{(3 + 4i)(1 - i)}{(1 + i)(1 - i)}
\]

- **Denominator**: 
  \[
  (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2
  \]

- **Numerator**:
  \[
  (3 + 4i)(1 - i) = 3 - 3i + 4i - 4i^2 = 7 + i
  \]

- **Final Result**:
  \[
  \frac{7}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i
  \]

The text also encourages exploring complex numbers through Argand diagrams and polar forms, offering deeper insights into operations like multiplication. It suggests using mathematical tools for verification while emphasizing the educational benefit of manual calculations. Furthermore, it teases advanced topics such as finding the sine or natural logarithm of a complex number for future discussions, highlighting the rich arithmetic possibilities with complex numbers.
