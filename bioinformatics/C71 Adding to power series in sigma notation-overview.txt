The text describes how to combine two power series into a single series by aligning their indices. Here's a summary:

1. **Identify Series Start Points**: The first series starts at \( n = 2 \) and the second at \( n = 0 \). To align them, adjust the starting point of the first series to \( n = 3 \), extracting the initial term \( 2(c_2 x^0) \).

2. **Align Powers**: Adjust indices so both series start with the same power of \( x \). For the first series, redefine it from \( n = 3 \) onwards as \( (n-1)c_n x^{n-2} \), starting at \( x^1 \). The second series is already in terms of \( x^n \).

3. **Introduce a New Variable**: Use \( k \) to unify indices:
   - For the first series, set \( k = n - 2 \) (so \( n = k + 2 \)).
   - For the second series, set \( k = n + 1 \) (so \( n = k - 1 \)).

4. **Rewrite Series**: 
   - The adjusted first series becomes: \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (k+2)(k+1)c_{k+2}x^k \).
   - The second series becomes: \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c_{k-1}x^k \).

5. **Combine Series**: Combine the two into a single series:
   \[
   2c_2 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} [(k+2)(k+1)c_{k+2} - c_{k-1}] x^k
   \]

This results in a unified expression for the sum of the two original series.

The text outlines a method for combining two infinite series into a single series. Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Series Setup**: Two series are given, with one starting at \( n = 2 \) and another at \( n = 0 \). The goal is to align their powers of \( x \).

2. **Adjusting the Start Point**: To synchronize the starting power of \( x \), the first series is adjusted to start from \( n = 3 \), extracting the initial term (\( 2, (2-1)c_2x^0 \)) outside the summation.

3. **Re-indexing with a New Variable**: Introduce a new variable \( k \) to unify the indices:
   - For the first series: Set \( k = n - 2 \).
   - For the second series: Set \( k = n + 1 \).

4. **Expressing in Terms of \( k \)**:
   - The adjusted first series becomes a sum from \( k = 1 \) to infinity.
   - The original second series is re-indexed similarly.

5. **Combining Series**: Both series are now expressed with the same starting power and index, allowing them to be combined into one summation:
   - Combine terms as \( c_{k+2}x^k \) from the first series and \( c_{k-1}x^k \) from the second.
   - Resulting in a single series: 
     \[
     2c_2 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (c_{k+2}(k+1)(k+2) - c_{k-1}) x^k
     \]

6. **Final Expression**: The combined series is expressed as:
   \[
   c_2 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( (k+1)(k+2)c_{k+2} - c_{k-1} \right) x^k
   \]

This process effectively merges the two series into one, starting from a common power of \( x \).
