The text describes how to combine two power series into a single series by aligning their indices. Here's a summary:

1. **Identify Series Start Points**: The first series starts at \( n = 2 \) and the second at \( n = 0 \). To align them, adjust the starting point of the first series to \( n = 3 \), extracting the initial term \( 2(c_2 x^0) \).

2. **Align Powers**: Adjust indices so both series start with the same power of \( x \). For the first series, redefine it from \( n = 3 \) onwards as \( (n-1)c_n x^{n-2} \), starting at \( x^1 \). The second series is already in terms of \( x^n \).

3. **Introduce a New Variable**: Use \( k \) to unify indices:
   - For the first series, set \( k = n - 2 \) (so \( n = k + 2 \)).
   - For the second series, set \( k = n + 1 \) (so \( n = k - 1 \)).

4. **Rewrite Series**: 
   - The adjusted first series becomes: \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (k+2)(k+1)c_{k+2}x^k \).
   - The second series becomes: \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c_{k-1}x^k \).

5. **Combine Series**: Combine the two into a single series:
   \[
   2c_2 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} [(k+2)(k+1)c_{k+2} - c_{k-1}] x^k
   \]

This results in a unified expression for the sum of the two original series.
