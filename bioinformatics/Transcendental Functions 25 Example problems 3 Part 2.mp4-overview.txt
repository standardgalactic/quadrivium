The text provides a detailed explanation of differentiating composite functions using the product rule and u-substitution.

1. **Product Rule**: 
   - The functions given are \( f(x) = e^x \) and \( g(x) = \sin x + \cos x \).
   - Their derivatives are \( f'(x) = e^x \) and \( g'(x) = \cos x - \sin x \).
   - Using the product rule, the derivative of their product is:
     \[
     y' = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x) = e^x(\cos x - \sin x) + e^x(\sin x + \cos x)
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     y' = e^x(2\cos x)
     \]

2. **Chain Rule and U-Substitution**:
   - For the function \( y = \cos(u) \) where \( u = e^{-x^2} \), use the chain rule.
   - Differentiate \( y = \cos(u) \) with respect to \( u \): 
     \[
     \frac{dy}{du} = -\sin(u)
     \]
   - Differentiate \( u = e^{-x^2} \) with respect to \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{du}{dx} = e^{-x^2} \cdot (-2x) = -2xe^{-x^2}
     \]
   - Combine using the chain rule:
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = -\sin(e^{-x^2}) \cdot (-2xe^{-x^2})
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x e^{-x^2} \sin(e^{-x^2})
     \]

The text demonstrates the application of differentiation rules to find derivatives of composite functions.
