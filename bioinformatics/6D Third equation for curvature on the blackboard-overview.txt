The text provides a mathematical explanation of how to calculate the curvature (\(\kappa\)) of a curve defined by parametric equations. It starts with defining a function \(f(x)\) that's being parameterized using \(t\) such that \(x = t\) and thus \(f(t) = f(x)\). The position vector \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is described in two dimensions as \((t, f(t), 0)\).

To find the curvature, the text outlines taking derivatives of \(\mathbf{r}(t)\):  
- The first derivative \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) results in \((1, f'(t), 0)\).  
- The second derivative \(\mathbf{r}''(t)\) is \((0, f''(t), 0)\).

The curvature formula used involves the cross product of these two derivatives divided by the cube of the magnitude of \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\):
\[
\kappa = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)}{|\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3}
\]

The cross product is computed using a determinant, resulting in:
- A vector with components \((0, 0, f''(t))\) (only the \(k\) component is non-zero).

Finally, the magnitude of \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) is calculated as \(\sqrt{1 + [f'(t)]^2}\), leading to the curvature expression:
\[
\kappa = \frac{f''(t)}{(1 + [f'(t)]^2)^{3/2}}
\]

This equation provides another method to compute curvature in two dimensions. The text also references other methods and equations for calculating curvature, suggesting a variety of approaches depending on the specific problem context.

The text explains how to derive an expression for curvature (\(\kappa\)) using parametric equations and vector calculus. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Parametrization**: The function \(y = f(x)\) is reparametrized by setting \(x = t\), leading to position vectors \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, f(t), 0)\).

2. **Derivatives**:
   - First derivative: \(\mathbf{r}'(t) = (1, f'(t), 0)\).
   - Second derivative: \(\mathbf{r}''(t) = (0, f''(t), 0)\).

3. **Curvature Formula**: Curvature is given by:
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{\|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|^3}
   \]

4. **Cross Product**:
   - The cross product \(\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\) results in a vector \((0, 0, f''(t))\).
   - Magnitude of this vector is \(|f''(t)|\).

5. **Magnitude of First Derivative**:
   - \(\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{1 + (f'(t))^2}\).

6. **Curvature Expression**: Substituting these into the curvature formula gives:
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{|f''(t)|}{(1 + (f'(t))^2)^{3/2}}
   \]

This expression shows how curvature depends on the first and second derivatives of \(f(t)\). The text highlights that different methods can be used to derive this result, especially in two dimensions.
