The text provides a mathematical explanation of how to calculate the curvature (\(\kappa\)) of a curve defined by parametric equations. It starts with defining a function \(f(x)\) that's being parameterized using \(t\) such that \(x = t\) and thus \(f(t) = f(x)\). The position vector \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is described in two dimensions as \((t, f(t), 0)\).

To find the curvature, the text outlines taking derivatives of \(\mathbf{r}(t)\):  
- The first derivative \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) results in \((1, f'(t), 0)\).  
- The second derivative \(\mathbf{r}''(t)\) is \((0, f''(t), 0)\).

The curvature formula used involves the cross product of these two derivatives divided by the cube of the magnitude of \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\):
\[
\kappa = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)}{|\mathbf{r}'(t)|^3}
\]

The cross product is computed using a determinant, resulting in:
- A vector with components \((0, 0, f''(t))\) (only the \(k\) component is non-zero).

Finally, the magnitude of \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) is calculated as \(\sqrt{1 + [f'(t)]^2}\), leading to the curvature expression:
\[
\kappa = \frac{f''(t)}{(1 + [f'(t)]^2)^{3/2}}
\]

This equation provides another method to compute curvature in two dimensions. The text also references other methods and equations for calculating curvature, suggesting a variety of approaches depending on the specific problem context.
