Another example where we won't have a parametrized curve
but our curve will be expressed in terms of the f of x and x
as much as the f of x equals y equals 1 plus 2x
and x is an element of this domain of 0 to 1 of this
So we want the integral over some curve of x of y ds
So how are we going to do this?
Now x and y remain what they are because they are explicit functions in x and y
So that remains the same
All we now have to get is the ds dx
And how are we going to do that?
Well that is going to be the square root of
Now it becomes dx
The dx is squared plus dy dx squared
And I bring the dx over to the other side
In other words ds is going to be the square root of
What is dx dx?
Now x is an element they are going from 0 to 1
In other words x equals x
And if x equals x then from 0 to 1 dx dx is just 1
That you've got to see that that is just 1
Plus what is dy dx?
Well the first derivative of y with respect to x will just be 2
And 2 squared is 4
4 dx and that equals the square root of 5 dx
So this line integral will be going from 0 to 1 of x
And what is y?
y is 1 plus 2x
And what is ds?
Well that is the square root of 5 dx
So I can bring that square root of 5 out
Different integrals all going from 0 to 1
And we are going to have this x plus 2x squared dx
That equals the square root of 5
And I am going to have here
I am going to do it as 2 integrals
That is going to be a half x squared
Plus 2 thirds x to the power of 3
All going from 0 to 1
Which is going to leave me with the square root of 5
And that is going to give me a half plus 2 thirds
Half plus 2 thirds
And that will be the square root of 5
And now we are going to have 6
And that will be 7
So that is going to equal 7 square root of 5 divided by 6
So we did not have to have a function
A parametric function
We did not have to make a new vector r in x and y of t
We could just get ds directly
From taking dx dx squared and dy dx squared
Remembering that x equals x
That is what this is telling us
Wherever x is
That equals x as long as it is between 0 and 1
So dx dx becomes the first derivative of just the variable x
Which is 1
Which is 1
