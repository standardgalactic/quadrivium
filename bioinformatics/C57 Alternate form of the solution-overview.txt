The video explains an alternative way to represent the equation for simple harmonic motion. Traditionally, this motion can be expressed as \( x(t) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t) \). However, it's sometimes useful to express it in terms of amplitude and phase angle: \( A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \), where \( A \) is the amplitude and \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

This approach connects with uniform circular motion viewed from the side. Instead of starting at zero, you might start at a different point, akin to giving the system some initial velocity. This changes how we perceive amplitude; it's not just the maximum displacement but rather derived from both components \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

To prove that these forms are equivalent, trigonometric identities are used. The relationship between \( A \), \( \phi \), \( c_1 \), and \( c_2 \) is established through the equations:
- \( A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} \)
- \( \sin(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{A} \)
- \( \cos(\phi) = \frac{c_2}{A} \)

Substituting these into the sine and cosine terms shows that both expressions for motion are equivalent. The amplitude \( A \) can be calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). Additionally, if there is a non-zero \( c_2 \), indicating an initial velocity or phase angle, you can find \( \phi \) using:
- \( \tan(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{c_2} \)

This demonstrates how amplitude and phase are related to the coefficients in the original harmonic motion equation.

The video explains an alternative way to express harmonic motion equations. Typically, harmonic motion might be written as \( x(t) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t) \). However, it can also be expressed in the form \( a \sin(\omega t + \phi) \), where \( a \) is the amplitude and \( \phi \) is a phase angle. This alternative representation is useful for understanding initial conditions, such as starting from a position other than equilibrium or with an initial velocity.

To show these two forms are equivalent, the video uses trigonometric identities and algebra:

1. By representing the equation geometrically using uniform circular motion, we can define \( a \) (the amplitude) as the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), i.e., \( a = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} \).

2. The phase angle \( \phi \) is determined using:
   - \(\sin(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{a}\)
   - \(\cos(\phi) = \frac{c_2}{a}\)

3. Substituting these into the sine addition formula, we derive that:
   - \( a \sin(\omega t + \phi) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t) \)

4. If \( c_2 \neq 0 \), the amplitude is calculated as \( a = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} \). The phase angle \( \phi \) can be found using:
   - \(\tan(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{c_2}\)
   - \(\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{c_1}{c_2}\right)\)

This demonstrates that the two forms of expressing harmonic motion are mathematically equivalent, allowing for flexible analysis depending on initial conditions.
