The video explains an alternative way to represent the equation for simple harmonic motion. Traditionally, this motion can be expressed as \( x(t) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t) \). However, it's sometimes useful to express it in terms of amplitude and phase angle: \( A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \), where \( A \) is the amplitude and \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

This approach connects with uniform circular motion viewed from the side. Instead of starting at zero, you might start at a different point, akin to giving the system some initial velocity. This changes how we perceive amplitude; it's not just the maximum displacement but rather derived from both components \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

To prove that these forms are equivalent, trigonometric identities are used. The relationship between \( A \), \( \phi \), \( c_1 \), and \( c_2 \) is established through the equations:
- \( A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2} \)
- \( \sin(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{A} \)
- \( \cos(\phi) = \frac{c_2}{A} \)

Substituting these into the sine and cosine terms shows that both expressions for motion are equivalent. The amplitude \( A \) can be calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). Additionally, if there is a non-zero \( c_2 \), indicating an initial velocity or phase angle, you can find \( \phi \) using:
- \( \tan(\phi) = \frac{c_1}{c_2} \)

This demonstrates how amplitude and phase are related to the coefficients in the original harmonic motion equation.
