The text provides an overview of primary hyperparathyroidism, focusing on its detection, symptoms, and clinical implications. Here's a summary:

1. **Detection**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is often identified through routine biochemical screenings that measure calcium levels. In 80% of cases, it's diagnosed biochemically before any clinical symptoms appear.

2. **Asymptomatic vs. Symptomatic Patients**:
   - Many patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms like fatigue, weakness, anorexia, and cognitive dysfunction.
   - Symptoms become more evident when the condition progresses, historically referred to as "bones, stones, abdominal moans, psychiatric groans."

3. **Symptoms**: 
   - Symptoms are related to both elevated calcium levels and parathyroid hormone activity, but not directly proportional to calcium levels.
   - Common symptoms include nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), bone pain, anorexia, nausea, constipation, polydipsia, and polyuria.
   - Neuromuscular issues like weakness and fatigue, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression and cognitive dysfunction, and cardiovascular issues like hypertension are also noted.

4. **Bone and Nephrolithiasis**:
   - Bone disease manifests as osteoporosis or rare conditions like osteitis fibrosa cystica.
   - Nephrolithiasis is the most common complaint among symptomatic patients, often due to hypercalciuria (excess calcium in urine).

5. **Metabolic and Cardiovascular Effects**:
   - Patients may experience glucose intolerance, increased BMI, hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy.
   - Increased mortality is associated with severe disease, primarily due to cardiovascular complications.

6. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Elevated or high-normal calcium levels paired with inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone levels confirm the diagnosis.
   - Other findings include mild renal impairment, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic acidosis, and normocytic anemia.

7. **Parathyroid Crisis**: 
   - A rare but severe complication characterized by extreme hypercalcemia, central nervous system symptoms (confusion, coma), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potential pancreatitis.

This summary encapsulates the key points about primary hyperparathyroidism as described in the text.
