The text explains how different types of loops can be nested within each other, specifically showcasing a `for` loop with an embedded `if` statement. The example iterates numbers from 1 to 10 and checks if each number is divisible by 3 using the modulus operator (`%`). If a number is divisible by 3 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 3 is zero), it uses a `continue` statement, which skips printing that number and moves directly to the next iteration of the loop. 

This demonstrates two key concepts:
1. An `if` condition can be placed inside a `for` loop.
2. The `continue` statement allows skipping certain iterations based on a conditionâ€”in this case, when a number is divisible by 3.

When executing the code line-by-line:
- For numbers not divisible by 3 (like 1, 2, 4, etc.), it prints them because the `if` condition is false and the `continue` statement does not activate.
- For numbers divisible by 3 (like 3, 6, 9), it skips printing them due to the `continue` being triggered when the `if` condition evaluates as true.

The text concludes by mentioning that they will explore a concept called "comprehension" in the next section.

The text explains how you can nest different types of loops within each other in programming, using a `for` loop with an embedded `if` statement as an example. The specific scenario presented involves iterating through numbers from 1 to 10 and checking if each number is divisible by 3 using the modulus operator (`%`). If a number is divisible by 3 (i.e., leaves no remainder when divided by 3), the `continue` statement is executed, which skips printing that particular number.

Here's how it works in detail:
- The `for` loop iterates over each integer from 1 to 10.
- Within the loop, an `if` statement checks if the current number (`i`) is divisible by 3 (using `i % 3 == 0`).
- If this condition is true (meaning there's no remainder), the `continue` statement skips the rest of the code within the loop for that iteration.
- As a result, numbers like 3, 6, and 9 are skipped over, while other numbers from 1 to 10 that aren't divisible by 3 get printed.

The key takeaway is how the `continue` statement functions: it interrupts the current iteration of the loop when its condition is met and resumes with the next iteration. This mechanism helps in filtering out specific values (in this case, multiples of 3) from being processed further within the loop's body. The text concludes by mentioning a future topic called "comprehension," suggesting that more advanced or concise methods for similar operations might be covered later.
