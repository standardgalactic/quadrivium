The text explains how different types of loops can be nested within each other, specifically showcasing a `for` loop with an embedded `if` statement. The example iterates numbers from 1 to 10 and checks if each number is divisible by 3 using the modulus operator (`%`). If a number is divisible by 3 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 3 is zero), it uses a `continue` statement, which skips printing that number and moves directly to the next iteration of the loop. 

This demonstrates two key concepts:
1. An `if` condition can be placed inside a `for` loop.
2. The `continue` statement allows skipping certain iterations based on a conditionâ€”in this case, when a number is divisible by 3.

When executing the code line-by-line:
- For numbers not divisible by 3 (like 1, 2, 4, etc.), it prints them because the `if` condition is false and the `continue` statement does not activate.
- For numbers divisible by 3 (like 3, 6, 9), it skips printing them due to the `continue` being triggered when the `if` condition evaluates as true.

The text concludes by mentioning that they will explore a concept called "comprehension" in the next section.
