Let's have a look at differentiating and exponential.
Let me underline that. There we go.
Now, if you watch video 9 in this transcendental function series called proof of the first derivative of e to the x,
you'll see that the first derivative of e to the x is e to the x, which is quite fantastic.
If you think about it, e is such a fantastic number, the same as pi would be.
Why would this specific, very specific irrational number have these quite fantastic properties?
But we need to just expand this.
And we expand it by saying if u equals any differentiable function of x.
So what would be, what would be the first derivative of e to the power u?
Well, if, if, let's see, if y equals e to the power u, and we do the chain rule, so we need to get dy dx.
And that u refers to the differentiable function of x.
So that is going to be the ddu of e to the power u times d dx of u.
So I've just taken that u outside.
I haven't changed anything.
Now, in that video 9 proof, we've just seen that e to the power anything remains e to the power anything.
So this equals just e to the power u times d dx of u, where u is a differentiable function of x.
So, let's see if we can have a quick look.
Let's just go, add a new page in this program.
Windows journal for tablet PCs.
Let's have a quick look.
If we are asked to evaluate the first derivative of, so d dx of, say, e to the power sine of x.
So now, now my u equals sine x.
It's a, the u represented, as we said up, up there in the proof, it is a, um, is a differentiable function of x.
So that is going to be equal to, the same still remains, e to the power u, which is that part that still remains.
So we're still going to have e to the power sine x times d dx of u.
And this was u.
And d dx times the d dx of sine of x.
And that is just the cosine of x.
So this is e to the power sine of x times the cosine of x.
Easy.
