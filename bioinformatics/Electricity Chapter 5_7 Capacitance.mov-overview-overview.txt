The provided text explores how inserting a dielectric material into a capacitor affects its properties under different conditions—specifically whether a battery remains connected or is removed. Here's a summarized overview:

1. **Dielectrics and Capacitance**: Dielectrics are materials placed between the plates of a capacitor to increase its capacitance. The constant for vacuum, denoted as κ (kappa), equals one, and any material with a dielectric constant greater than one will enhance the capacitance.

2. **Initial Scenario and Changes**:
   - A parallel plate capacitor initially has a capacitance of \(13.5 \times 10^{-12}\) farads and is connected to a 12.5-volt battery, allowing it to build up charge.
   - After charging, the battery is disconnected, and a porcelain slab with κ = 6.50 is inserted.

3. **Electric Potential Energy**: The initial potential energy of the capacitor can be calculated using \( U = \frac{1}{2} CV^2 \). Once the battery is removed, inserting a dielectric reduces voltage but maintains constant charge.

4. **Effects Based on Battery Connection**:
   - **Battery Removed Before Dielectric Insertion**: Charge remains constant while voltage decreases.
   - **Battery Connected During Dielectric Insertion**: The potential difference stays constant due to the battery, leading to increased capacitance (\( C_{\text{final}} = \kappa C \)), increased charge on the capacitor, and consequently greater stored energy (\( U_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} \kappa C V^2 \)). The electric field decreases due to the increase in capacitance and dielectric constant.

5. **Key Considerations**: 
   - When inserting a dielectric, replace ε₀ with κε₀ in equations.
   - Capacitance changes to \( \kappa C \).
   - Whether the battery is connected or removed dictates which formulas are applicable for calculating charge and potential energy.

Additionally, another scenario involves modifying the capacitor by:
- Inserting a dielectric with constant κ.
- Doubling the separation distance between plates from \( d \) to \( 2d \).

**Resulting Changes**: 
- The final capacitance is twice the initial capacitance (\( 2C \)).

**Calculation of Dielectric Constant \( \kappa \)**:
- Using the formula for a plate capacitor's capacitance, \( C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d} \), and modifying it with dielectric insertion and increased distance: \( C' = \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{2d} \).
- Setting \( C' = 2C \) leads to solving for κ:
  \[
  \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{2d} = 2 \times \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
  \]
- Solving this equation gives the dielectric constant as \( \kappa = 4 \).

The text confirms these findings as accurate, demonstrating how dielectrics and plate separation changes affect capacitor properties.
