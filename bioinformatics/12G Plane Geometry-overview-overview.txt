The text provides an overview of determining parallelism between planes using their normal vectors. Two planes in vector form \(\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0}) = 0\) are parallel if their normal vectors are scalar multiples of each other, such as one being a multiple of -2 of the other.

To find a plane through a point and perpendicular to a line given in polar coordinates, construct two vectors: one along the line and another from a known point on the plane. The dot product set to zero indicates these vectors are perpendicular, giving an equation for the plane.

The text also explains deriving equations for planes parallel to or coinciding with specific coordinate planes:

1. **XY Plane**: Defined by \(z = 0\), lying flat in the X-Y axis.
2. **Parallel Planes to XY**: Have equations of the form \(z = c\).
3. **XZ and YZ Planes**: Defined by \(y = 0\) and \(x = 0\), respectively.

Additionally, planes parallel to the YZ plane have equations like \(x = x_0\).

Unit vectors along axes are:
- Z-axis: \((0, 0, 1)\)
- X-axis: \((1, 0, 0)\)
- Y-axis: \((0, 1, 0)\)

For parallel planes, constants like \(z_0\) vary. A plane's equation uses its normal vector, which is perpendicular to the plane, such as using the Z-axis unit vector for a plane perpendicular to the XY plane.

The text details how to represent planes in three-dimensional space by setting one coordinate constant and utilizing vectors.
