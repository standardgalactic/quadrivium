The text describes how to calculate the force on charged particles—specifically electrons and protons—moving through uniform magnetic fields. It outlines the use of vector cross products to determine these forces.

1. **Electron Force Calculation:**
   - An electron is given a velocity vector \( \vec{v} = (2.0 \times 10^6) \hat{i} + (3.0 \times 10^6) \hat{j} \, \text{m/s} \).
   - It moves through a uniform magnetic field \( \vec{B} = 0.03 \hat{i} - 0.15 \hat{j} \, \text{T} \).
   - The force on the electron is calculated using the formula \( \vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \), where \( q \) is the charge of the electron.
   - Since the electron has a negative charge, its velocity vector is multiplied by \(-1\).

2. **Proton Force Calculation:**
   - A proton's velocity components are given as \( V_x \) and \( V_y \).
   - The magnetic field is described with specific components leading to a force calculation using \( \vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \), where \( q \) is the charge of the proton.
   - By setting up equations from the known forces in the x and y directions, one can solve for \( V_x \) and \( V_y \).

3. **Cross-Field Effect:**
   - The text briefly introduces the concept of a charged particle moving through a region with both electric and magnetic fields (cross-field effect).
   - This scenario is linked to the discovery of the electron.
   - It describes how an electric field between two plates can exert a force on a charged particle, in addition to any force from a magnetic field.

The calculations involve using vector cross products to find forces in specific directions, and algebraic manipulation helps solve for unknown velocity components. The text also emphasizes checking results by ensuring the z-component of the force is zero when no force should be present in that direction.

The text discusses how electric and magnetic fields can be manipulated to create a scenario where there is no net force on an electron, allowing it to move in a straight line without deflection. By setting up these fields such that their forces cancel each other out (i.e., the force from the electric field plus the force from the magnetic field equals zero), one can achieve this condition.

The text introduces the equation for deflection \( Y \) of a charged particle moving through parallel plates, given by \( Y = \frac{E L^2}{2mV^2} \). It further explains that when these forces cancel out, the force from the electric field (\( QE \)) equals the force due to the magnetic field (\( QVB\sin(\phi) \)), leading to the relationship \( V = \frac{E}{B} \).

By substituting this velocity into the deflection equation, one can derive an expression for the charge-to-mass ratio of a particle, as discovered by Rutherford. This ratio is given by \( \left( \frac{m}{q} \right) = \frac{B^2L^2}{2YE} \), where measurements of magnetic field strength (\( B \)), length of plates (\( L \)), deflection (\( Y \)), and electric field (\( E \)) are used to determine this property.

The key takeaway is the understanding that it is possible to configure electric and magnetic fields in such a way that they counterbalance each other, resulting in no net force on a charged particle moving through them. This principle can be applied to solve related physics problems, which will be explored further in subsequent videos.

The text describes two scenarios involving charged particles moving through uniform magnetic fields and calculates the forces acting on them using the Lorentz force equation \( \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) \), where \( q \) is the charge, \( \mathbf{v} \) is velocity, and \( \mathbf{B} \) is the magnetic field.

### Scenario 1: Electron
- **Velocity**: \( 2.0 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) in the \( \hat{i} \)-direction and \( 3.0 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) in the \( \hat{j} \)-direction.
- **Magnetic Field**: \( 30 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T} \) in the \( \hat{i} \)-direction and \( -20 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{T} \) in the \( \hat{j} \)-direction.
- **Charge of Electron**: \( -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).
- The force on the electron is calculated using vector cross product and substituting into the Lorentz force formula.

### Scenario 2: Proton
- **Velocity Components**: \( v_x \) in the \( \hat{i} \)-direction, \( v_y \) in the \( \hat{j} \)-direction, and \( 2000 \, \text{m/s} \) in the \( \hat{k} \)-direction.
- **Magnetic Field**: Same as for the electron scenario.
- **Charge of Proton**: \( +1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).
- The force on the proton is calculated similarly by solving for unknown velocity components using given force magnitudes.

### Cross-field Effect
The text also briefly touches upon the cross-field effect where charged particles are subjected to both electric and magnetic fields. This setup can lead to interesting phenomena like electron deflection, which was crucial in understanding the electron's properties.

Overall, these examples demonstrate how to calculate forces on moving charges in magnetic fields and introduce additional concepts related to combined electric and magnetic field effects.

The text discusses how electric and magnetic fields can be arranged so that their combined force on an electron results in no net movement, allowing the particle to travel straight. This involves understanding the cross-product of velocity and field vectors.

An equation from earlier studies relates the deflection \( Y \) (or \( Q \)) of a charged particle moving through electric plates: 

\[ Y = \frac{E L^2}{2mV^2} \]

Where:
- \( E \) is the electric field strength
- \( L \) is the length of the plates
- \( m \) is the mass of the particle
- \( V \) is its velocity

When the forces from the electric and magnetic fields cancel each other, \( F_E + F_B = 0 \), this leads to:

\[ QE = QVB\sin(\phi) \]

With the angle \( \phi \) being 90 degrees, this simplifies to:

\[ V = \frac{E}{B} \]

Substituting this velocity into the deflection equation gives a relationship discovered by Rutherford:

\[ \text{mass per magnitude charge} = \frac{B^2 L^2}{2Y E} \]

Rutherford could measure the magnetic field strength, plate length, deflection, and electric field to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of particles.

The text emphasizes that while these equations are mathematically interesting, their practical significance lies in how electric and magnetic fields can be used together to influence particle motion. This concept will be further explored through problem-solving in subsequent discussions.
