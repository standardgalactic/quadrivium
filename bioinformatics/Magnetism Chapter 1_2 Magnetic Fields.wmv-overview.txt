The text describes how to calculate the force on charged particles—specifically electrons and protons—moving through uniform magnetic fields. It outlines the use of vector cross products to determine these forces.

1. **Electron Force Calculation:**
   - An electron is given a velocity vector \( \vec{v} = (2.0 \times 10^6) \hat{i} + (3.0 \times 10^6) \hat{j} \, \text{m/s} \).
   - It moves through a uniform magnetic field \( \vec{B} = 0.03 \hat{i} - 0.15 \hat{j} \, \text{T} \).
   - The force on the electron is calculated using the formula \( \vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \), where \( q \) is the charge of the electron.
   - Since the electron has a negative charge, its velocity vector is multiplied by \(-1\).

2. **Proton Force Calculation:**
   - A proton's velocity components are given as \( V_x \) and \( V_y \).
   - The magnetic field is described with specific components leading to a force calculation using \( \vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \), where \( q \) is the charge of the proton.
   - By setting up equations from the known forces in the x and y directions, one can solve for \( V_x \) and \( V_y \).

3. **Cross-Field Effect:**
   - The text briefly introduces the concept of a charged particle moving through a region with both electric and magnetic fields (cross-field effect).
   - This scenario is linked to the discovery of the electron.
   - It describes how an electric field between two plates can exert a force on a charged particle, in addition to any force from a magnetic field.

The calculations involve using vector cross products to find forces in specific directions, and algebraic manipulation helps solve for unknown velocity components. The text also emphasizes checking results by ensuring the z-component of the force is zero when no force should be present in that direction.

The text discusses how electric and magnetic fields can be manipulated to create a scenario where there is no net force on an electron, allowing it to move in a straight line without deflection. By setting up these fields such that their forces cancel each other out (i.e., the force from the electric field plus the force from the magnetic field equals zero), one can achieve this condition.

The text introduces the equation for deflection \( Y \) of a charged particle moving through parallel plates, given by \( Y = \frac{E L^2}{2mV^2} \). It further explains that when these forces cancel out, the force from the electric field (\( QE \)) equals the force due to the magnetic field (\( QVB\sin(\phi) \)), leading to the relationship \( V = \frac{E}{B} \).

By substituting this velocity into the deflection equation, one can derive an expression for the charge-to-mass ratio of a particle, as discovered by Rutherford. This ratio is given by \( \left( \frac{m}{q} \right) = \frac{B^2L^2}{2YE} \), where measurements of magnetic field strength (\( B \)), length of plates (\( L \)), deflection (\( Y \)), and electric field (\( E \)) are used to determine this property.

The key takeaway is the understanding that it is possible to configure electric and magnetic fields in such a way that they counterbalance each other, resulting in no net force on a charged particle moving through them. This principle can be applied to solve related physics problems, which will be explored further in subsequent videos.
