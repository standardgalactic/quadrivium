The text provides an explanation and examples of the comparison test for determining series convergence. Here's a summary:

1. **Comparison Test Basics**:
   - If \(0 \leq A_k \leq B_k\) for all terms in the series, and if \(\sum B_k\) converges, then \(\sum A_k\) also converges.
   - Conversely, if \(\sum A_k\) diverges and \(A_k \leq B_k\), then \(\sum B_k\) must also diverge.

2. **Example**:
   - For the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 + 5k}\):
     - Compared to \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) (a known convergent p-series with \(p > 1\)).
     - Since \(\frac{1}{k^3 + 5k} < \frac{1}{k^3}\), the series converges by comparison.
   - For \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 - 5k}\):
     - Compared to \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\), but this time \(A_k > B_k\).
     - The comparison test cannot be applied directly because the inequality is reversed.

3. **Geometric Series Example**:
   - For \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{5(k+1)}{2^{k-1}}\):
     - Approximated by \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{5}{2^k}\), a geometric series with ratio \(r = 2.5 > 1\).
     - The geometric series diverges, so the original series also diverges.

4. **Limit Comparison Test**:
   - If \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{A_k}{B_k} = c\) where \(c > 0\), then both series either converge or diverge together.
   - Applied to \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 - 5k}\):
     - The limit comparison test can be used when the direct comparison fails due to reversed inequalities.

The text emphasizes understanding the conditions under which these tests apply and provides examples to illustrate their use.

The text provides a solution to a mathematical problem using the limit comparison test. The speaker simplifies an expression by bringing terms into the numerator, resulting in \( k^3 - 5k \), which then disappears under certain operations. This leads to another simplified form, \( 1 - \frac{5}{k^2} \). By dividing these expressions and taking the limit as \( k \) approaches infinity, they find that the expression converges to 1, since terms involving \( \frac{1}{k^2} \) become negligible. This confirms the convergence of both series being compared through the limit comparison test, ultimately solving the problem and demonstrating how this method simplifies such analyses.

The text provides an explanation and examples of using the comparison test and the limit comparison test for determining whether series converge or diverge.

### Comparison Test:
- **Basic Principle**: If you have two series \(\sum A_k\) and \(\sum B_k\) such that \(0 \leq A_k \leq B_k\):
  - If \(\sum B_k\) converges, then \(\sum A_k\) also converges.
  - Conversely, if \(\sum A_k\) diverges, then \(\sum B_k\) must also diverge.

- **Example**:
  - Consider \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) and compare it with \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 + 5k}\).
    - Since \(k^3 < k^3 + 5k\), we have \(\frac{1}{k^3 + 5k} < \frac{1}{k^3}\).
    - The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent \(p\)-series (\(p = 3 > 1\)).
    - Therefore, by the comparison test, \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 + 5k}\) also converges.

### Limit Comparison Test:
- **Basic Principle**: If \(a_k\) and \(b_k\) are both positive for all \(k\), and the limit \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} = c\) where \(0 < c < \infty\), then either both series converge or both diverge.

- **Example**:
  - Consider comparing \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) with \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 - 5k}\).
  - Compute the limit: \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\frac{1}{k^3}}{\frac{1}{k^3 - 5k}} = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k^3 - 5k}{k^3} = \lim_{k \to \infty} (1 - \frac{5}{k^2}) = 1\).
  - Since the limit is a positive finite number, both series either converge or diverge.
  - Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) converges, so does \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3 - 5k}\).

The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing patterns and knowing key series properties to apply these tests effectively.

The speaker is explaining how to use the Limit Comparison Test to determine if two series either both converge or both diverge. They start by manipulating an expression, bringing it into the numerator and simplifying it to \( k^3 - 5k \), which cancels out, leaving \( 1 - \frac{5}{k^2} \). By taking the limit as \( k \) approaches infinity, they find that this expression tends towards 1. Since a non-zero finite limit (greater than 0) is obtained when comparing two series, both series will either converge or diverge together. In this case, since one of the series converges, it implies that the other series also converges, effectively solving their comparison test problem using the Limit Comparison Test and highlighting its utility in simplifying such problems.
