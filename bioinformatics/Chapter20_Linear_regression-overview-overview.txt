The text introduces linear regression as a statistical method used to analyze the relationship between two sets of numerical values. While it briefly mentions other techniques such as t-tests and chi-squared tests, it highlights that linear regression is particularly effective for exploring how variables are related by fitting a linear equation to observed data. This helps in understanding the impact one variable has on another within a dataset. The text encourages further exploration of this method.
