Postpartum thyroiditis is a condition that can occur within the first year after childbirth. It involves abnormal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) without TSH receptor antibodies or toxic nodules being present. Approximately 25% of women experience transient hyperthyroidism from 6 weeks to 6 months postpartum, followed by hypothyroidism that may last up to a year. Hyperthyroid phases are typically short-lived, and antithyroid drugs are rarely recommended. Beta blockers might be used for adrenergic symptoms.

Hypothyroidism in some patients can become permanent, necessitating thyroxine treatment. Regular follow-up is crucial for those affected. It's important to consider postpartum thyroiditis during postpartum visits as its symptoms, such as depression, may otherwise be mistakenly attributed to normal postpartum experiences. Evaluating TSH and T4 levels along with thyroid peroxidase antibodies should be part of the assessment.

Additionally, Graves' thyroiditis is notable, as up to 60% of women who develop Graves' disease during their reproductive years might do so in the postpartum period. Graves' disease is diagnosed by suppressed TSH levels, elevated thyroid hormones, and often the presence of TSH receptor antibodies, with confirmatory scintigraphy results.
