The text describes a scenario involving special relativity where an observer measures the properties of a glass cube. The stationary observer sees the cube with edges 15 cm long (denoted as \(L_0\)) and a mass of 2.9 kg. A second observer moves relative to the cube along one edge and measures its density as 7800 kg/mÂ³.

The moving observer perceives a higher density due to length contraction, resulting in a smaller observed volume while the mass remains constant. To find the relative speed (\(v\)) of the moving observer with respect to the cube, we use the concept of length contraction from special relativity:

1. **Density Relation**: Density is given by \(\rho = \frac{m}{V}\), where \(V\) is volume.
2. **Volume of a Cube**: For the stationary observer, volume \(V_0 = L_0^3\). For the moving observer, volume \(V = L^3\).
3. **Length Contraction**: The length observed by the moving observer is contracted: \(L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\).

Given:
- Stationary density calculation: \(\rho_0 = \frac{m}{L_0^3}\).
- Moving observer's density: \(\rho = 7800 \, \text{kg/m}^3\).

Using the relation between densities and volumes:
\[ \rho = \frac{\rho_0 L_0^3}{L^3} \]

Substitute \(L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\) into the equation:
\[ \rho = \frac{\rho_0 L_0^3}{(L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}})^3} \]

Solve for \(v\):
\[ v = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)^2} \]

Calculate \(L\) using:
\[ L = \left(\frac{m}{\rho}\right)^{1/3} \]

Substitute known values (\(m = 2.9 \, \text{kg}\), \(\rho = 7800 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)) to find \(L\) and then solve for \(v\).

The result is:
\[ v = 0.88c \]

This indicates the moving observer's speed relative to the cube is 88% of the speed of light.
