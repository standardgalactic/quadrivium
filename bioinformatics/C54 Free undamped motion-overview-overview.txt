The text introduces a mathematical model for free undamped harmonic motion using a linear differential equation with constant coefficients. It focuses on a mass-spring system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates without external forces like friction or air resistance, allowing the motion to continue indefinitely.

To develop this model, Hooke's Law is applied, which relates the restoring force in a spring to its displacement from equilibrium through a spring constant \( k \). Newton's second law (\( F = ma \)) is also used. From these principles, the equation of motion for the system is derived as:

\[ m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0 \]

By dividing by the mass \( m \), this becomes a homogeneous second-order linear differential equation:

\[ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0 \]

where \( \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \) and \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of oscillation. The solution to this differential equation involves sine and cosine functions:

\[ x(t) = c_1 \cos(\omega t) + c_2 \sin(\omega t) \]

The period of oscillation, or the time for one complete cycle, is \( T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \), while the frequency, representing cycles per second, is \( f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \).

This model enables predictions about the mass's position at any time \( t \) and illustrates how the spring constant and mass affect oscillatory motion characteristics.
