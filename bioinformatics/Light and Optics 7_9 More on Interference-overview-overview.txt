The text explores wave interference issues involving both radio and light waves through various scenarios:

1. **Radio Waves from Two Antennas:**
   - Radio signals are received at a house from two antennas located 7 km and 8.12 km away, respectively. The path difference between these antennas is 1.12 km (1120 meters).
   - Constructive interference occurs when this path difference equals an integer multiple of the wavelength, while destructive interference happens at half-integer multiples.
   - Given a frequency of 536,000 Hz and using the speed of light (\(3 \times 10^8\) m/s), the wavelength is approximately 560 meters. Since 1120 meters equals two wavelengths (2 * 560), constructive interference occurs.

2. **Double Slit Experiment with Light:**
   - The experiment uses red light (~665 nm) and yellow-green light (~565 nm) to create an interference pattern on a screen placed 2.24 m away.
   - To find the distance between the third-order bright fringes of these colors, the formula \( Y = L \times \tan(\theta) \), with \( \theta = \arcsin(M \lambda / D) \) and \( M = 3 \), is used.
   - The calculated difference in positions (\( \Delta Y \)) between the third-order bright fringes for the two colors is about 4.25 mm.

3. **Young's Double Slit Experiment with a Plastic Sheet:**
   - Monochromatic light passes through slits, one covered by a plastic sheet with a refractive index of 1.60.
   - For destructive interference at the central axis (dark fringe), the path difference must be half a wavelength.
   - Using \( (n_2 - n_1) \cdot L = m \lambda / 2 \), where \( n_2 = 1.60 \) and \( n_1 = 1.00 \), the minimum thickness \( L \) is calculated as \( \lambda / 1.2 \).
   - The thinnest plastic sheet to achieve total destructive interference has a thickness of approximately 488 nm.

These scenarios demonstrate how wave interference, path differences, and wavelength interactions influence constructive and destructive interference patterns in both radio and light waves.
