The text explains two fundamental properties of binary operations: the commutative and associative properties. A binary operation involves applying a rule to two elements from a set.

1. **Commutative Property**: A binary operation on a set \( X \) is considered commutative if changing the order of the elements does not change the result. Formally, for any elements \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) in set \( X \), the operation satisfies: 
   \[
   x_1 \circ x_2 = x_2 \circ x_1
   \]
   where \( \circ \) is a generic symbol representing the binary operation. This property is defined by humans and can be used for proofs once established.

2. **Associative Property**: A binary operation on set \( X \) is associative if grouping of elements does not affect the outcome. Formally, for any elements \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \) in set \( X \), it satisfies:
   \[
   (x_1 \circ x_2) \circ x_3 = x_1 \circ (x_2 \circ x_3)
   \]
   Like the commutative property, this is a definition established by humans and can be applied in proofs.

Both properties are defined based on specific conditions that must hold for all elements of the set involved. Once these definitions are accepted, they become useful tools in mathematical reasoning and proof construction.
