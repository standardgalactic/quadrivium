The text provides an example of solving a system of autonomous differential equations using Python and the SymPy library. The system involves two unknowns and is expressed as:

\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = 5x + y \]
\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = -2x + 3y \]

The solution approach involves calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix, which are \(4 - i\) and \(4 + i\). This leads to real components for constructing solutions:

- **Eigenvalues**: \( \alpha = 4 \), \( \beta = -1 \)
- **Real and imaginary parts**:
  - Real part: \([-5, 1]\)
  - Imaginary part: \([5, 0]\)

Using these values, the general solution is formed with exponential terms involving the eigenvalues:

\[ x(t) = c_1 e^{4t} (\sin t - \cos t) + c_2 e^{4t} (\sin t + \cos t) \]
\[ y(t) = 2c_1 e^{4t} \cos t \]

Given initial conditions \(x(0) = -1\) and \(y(0) = 2\), the constants \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are determined by solving:

\[ -\frac{1}{2}c_1 + \frac{1}{2}c_2 = -1 \]
\[ c_1 - c_2 = 2 \]

The solutions for these constants are \(c_1 = 2\) and \(c_2 = 0\), leading to the specific solutions:

\[ x(t) = e^{4t} (\sin t - \cos t) \]
\[ y(t) = 2e^{4t} \cos t \]

Finally, a plot is generated using Matplotlib to visualize these solutions over time. The text emphasizes that this method provides an analytical solution rather than a numerical one.

The text describes an analytical exploration and visualization of autonomous equations using a point plot format. Initially, a solution is plotted to demonstrate its behavior over time, which appears as a smooth curve. As time progresses (e.g., increasing from 4 to 10), the plot reveals significant curvature changes and takes more computational time, suggesting inefficiency at larger scales.

Continuing this process with different values (such as trying 7) also results in lengthy computation times without much practical insight. Observations indicate that these solutions can lead to very large values if extended too far, which is not helpful for analysis.

Ultimately, the text suggests limiting observations to smaller time intervals (e.g., keeping it at 1), where a clear set of solutions becomes visible, providing more meaningful insights into the behavior of the system. This approach helps avoid computational inefficiency and overly complex visualizations.

The text provides an example of solving a system of autonomous differential equations using Python. The system consists of two equations involving unknowns \( x \) and \( y \), expressed as:

1. \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 5x + y \)
2. \( \frac{dy}{dt} = -2x + 3y \)

The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Matrix Representation**: The equations are represented in matrix form with coefficients:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 1 \\ -2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The eigenvalues of the matrix \( A \) are found to be \( 4-i \) and \( 4+i \). Corresponding eigenvectors are calculated for these eigenvalues.

3. **Solution Formulation**:
   - Using the eigenvalues, a general solution is constructed involving exponential terms and trigonometric functions due to complex eigenvalues.
   - The solution is expressed in terms of constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), leading to:
     \[
     x(t) = e^{4t} (c_1 (\sin t - \cos t))
     \]
     \[
     y(t) = 2e^{4t} \cos t
     \]

4. **Initial Conditions**: Initial conditions \( x(0) = -1 \), \( y(0) = 2 \) are applied to determine the constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

5. **Solving for Constants**:
   - A system of equations is formed using initial conditions, resulting in:
     \[
     -\frac{1}{2}c_1 + \frac{1}{2}c_2 = -1
     \]
     \[
     c_1 - c_2 = 2
     \]
   - Solving these gives \( c_1 = 2 \) and \( c_2 = 0 \).

6. **Final Solution**:
   - Substituting the constants back, the specific solutions are:
     \[
     x(t) = e^{4t} (\sin t - \cos t)
     \]
     \[
     y(t) = 2e^{4t} \cos t
     \]

7. **Visualization**: A simple plot is generated to visualize the trajectory of solutions over time, using a loop with small increments in time.

This example demonstrates symbolic computation and solution visualization using Python libraries like SymPy for algebraic manipulation and Matplotlib for plotting.

The text discusses analyzing a system of autonomous equations using a point plot method to visualize solutions over time. Initially, the author plots points and observes how the solution evolves as time progresses. By increasing the plotted points from 4 to 10, they note that this approach becomes inefficient and takes too much time without offering significant insights. The curvature in the solution suggests complexity at larger values of time. After experimenting with different numbers of points (including reverting back to 1), it's concluded that keeping the number of points low provides a clearer understanding of the solutions without unnecessary computational overhead. Overall, the focus is on finding an effective balance for visualizing the system's behavior over time.
