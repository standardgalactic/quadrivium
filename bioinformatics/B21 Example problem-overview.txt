The text provides an example of solving a system of autonomous differential equations using Python and the SymPy library. The system involves two unknowns and is expressed as:

\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = 5x + y \]
\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = -2x + 3y \]

The solution approach involves calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix, which are \(4 - i\) and \(4 + i\). This leads to real components for constructing solutions:

- **Eigenvalues**: \( \alpha = 4 \), \( \beta = -1 \)
- **Real and imaginary parts**:
  - Real part: \([-5, 1]\)
  - Imaginary part: \([5, 0]\)

Using these values, the general solution is formed with exponential terms involving the eigenvalues:

\[ x(t) = c_1 e^{4t} (\sin t - \cos t) + c_2 e^{4t} (\sin t + \cos t) \]
\[ y(t) = 2c_1 e^{4t} \cos t \]

Given initial conditions \(x(0) = -1\) and \(y(0) = 2\), the constants \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are determined by solving:

\[ -\frac{1}{2}c_1 + \frac{1}{2}c_2 = -1 \]
\[ c_1 - c_2 = 2 \]

The solutions for these constants are \(c_1 = 2\) and \(c_2 = 0\), leading to the specific solutions:

\[ x(t) = e^{4t} (\sin t - \cos t) \]
\[ y(t) = 2e^{4t} \cos t \]

Finally, a plot is generated using Matplotlib to visualize these solutions over time. The text emphasizes that this method provides an analytical solution rather than a numerical one.

The text describes an analytical exploration and visualization of autonomous equations using a point plot format. Initially, a solution is plotted to demonstrate its behavior over time, which appears as a smooth curve. As time progresses (e.g., increasing from 4 to 10), the plot reveals significant curvature changes and takes more computational time, suggesting inefficiency at larger scales.

Continuing this process with different values (such as trying 7) also results in lengthy computation times without much practical insight. Observations indicate that these solutions can lead to very large values if extended too far, which is not helpful for analysis.

Ultimately, the text suggests limiting observations to smaller time intervals (e.g., keeping it at 1), where a clear set of solutions becomes visible, providing more meaningful insights into the behavior of the system. This approach helps avoid computational inefficiency and overly complex visualizations.
