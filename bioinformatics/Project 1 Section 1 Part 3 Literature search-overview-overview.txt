The text offers guidance on conducting a literature search for clinically relevant medical information, highlighting PubMed as an ideal resource. It advises using advanced search features or Medical Subject Headings (MESH) instead of simple keyword searches to manage overwhelming results effectively. The author recommends watching YouTube tutorials from PubMed for efficient searching techniques. Once relevant articles are identified, they should be incorporated into the research protocol and reference list. Understanding existing literature is essential before initiating a new research project. Further discussion on types of research projects will be covered in a later section.
