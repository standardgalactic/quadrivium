The text emphasizes the critical need to identify diabetic patients in surgical settings due to their prevalent comorbidities, especially vascular complications affecting major organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys, and extremities. Diabetics face unique challenges like fluid shifts, osmotic diuresis, electrolyte imbalances, and immune deficits, which elevate risks of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia during surgery and increase post-operative infection rates and delayed wound healing.

Diagnosis involves recognizing symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss, particularly in overweight individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes. A thorough history, physical examination, and initial urinalysis are key diagnostic steps. Screening tools, such as online calculators considering age, sex, family history, and lifestyle, support the diagnosis.

For surgical management decisions, fasting glucose levels and glucose tolerance tests are prioritized over HbA1c for suspected diabetics. Preoperative evaluations should include cardiac assessments via stress ECG and renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes) to manage the higher risks of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients effectively.
