let's try and do another problem if we write this in well it's linear second
order homogeneous ordinary differential equation with variable variable
coefficients if we write this in standard form we're going to have 1 plus x divided
by 2xy prime plus 1 over 2xy equals 0 and do all the steps so we're comfortable with them
in other words p of x is going to equal 1 plus x divided by 2x and the q of x is going to equal
1 over 2 of x and we can really quickly see that we're going to have the singular point x sub 0
being 0 because both of them will be will be non-analytic at x sub 0 equals 0 we can't divide
by 0 for that reason is it regular or irregular we're going to construct the p of x remember let
me write it out it's going to be x minus x sub 0 times the p of x so all these problems is actually
going to be 0 so it's x times this which is just going to be 1 plus x times x divided by 2x which
is this 1 plus x divided by 2 that's always analytic independent of the value of x q of x is going to
equal x minus x minus x minus x sub 0 squared times the q of x that equals x squared times 1 over 2x that
equals x over 2 analytic for all values in other words x sub 0 equals 0 is a regular regular singular point
x sub 0 therefore we can make use of the fact that y equals the sum of n equals 0 to infinity of c sub n
x to the power n plus r now remember that x is actually x minus x sub 0 into the power r but x sub 0 is 0
we're constructing this series around the regular singular point x sub 0 therefore y prime is the sum of
i remind you the state 0 as opposed to the non-singular points c sub n n plus r x to the power n plus r minus 1
and y prime prime equals the sum of n equals 0 to infinity of c sub n n plus r n plus r minus 1 x to the power n plus r minus 2
so let's substitute these three values into our initial problem
so let's have a look i'm going to distribute the 2n so we're going to have 0 and we're going to have infinity
we're going to have c sub n we're going to have n plus r i'm going to multiply the 2n by this i'm going to have 2n
plus 2r minus 2 and if i put another extra x in there and it's going to be x to the power n plus r minus 1
only that plus now i've got to take this value and multiply it with 1 and then with x because 1 plus x
so just one of these would be the sum n equals 0 to infinity of c sub n n plus r x to the power n plus r minus 1
and if i distribute an x in there it's going to be the sum of n equals 0 to infinity of c sub n
n plus r x to the power n plus r just put an extra r x to the power 1 in there negative 1 positive 1 gives me 0
and then i have positive y just one extra um just a positive y where are we where are we plus y
and that is just the sum of course c sub n x to the power n plus r and that is all going to equal 0
that is all going to equal 0 now um let's have a look we need
we need we need to do uh something to sorry i was concentrating on something else so i think
clearly we can already see there's an n to the power r x to the power r x to the power x to the power x to
power r is available all all out we can take it out remember it does not change as n changes so we can
see it on its own so let's very quickly rewrite this and we have let's not forget the c sub n
c sub n n plus r 2 n plus 2 r minus 2 x to the power now i've taken that out so it's just n minus 1
that's left there plus the sum of n equals 0 to infinity of c sub n we have an n plus r we have an x
n minus 1 plus we have a sum of n equals 0 to infinity of c sub n n plus r to the power x to the power
n and another n equals 0 to infinity c sub n x to the power n and that is all go to equal 0.
now we can start adding some of these because we have an x to the power we start in at 0 we start in at
0 so we start this series at x to the power negative 1 and this one x to the power negative 1 so we can
add those two without introducing k this one starts at x to the power 0 this one starts at x
to the power 0 we can combine those two as well without introducing k so we're going to have x to
the power r we're going to have the sum of n equals 0 to infinity so let's combine these two what can
we take out as common factors a c sub n and n plus r we can take out and we can take out an x to the
power n minus 1 what if we have left on this side we have a 2n plus 2r and negative 2 plus one of this
so that leaves us with negative one so i've just combined the two if i multiply this three up by that
i'm going to get these two back i've taken this this so that that out as a common factor so what
domains this remains plus i've taken everything out so it's just one of these that remain negative
two plus one that's the negative i get there and on this side i'm going to have n equals zero to
infinity what can i take out the c sub n the x to the power n what is left behind n plus r plus one of
these so n plus r plus one so that makes life a bit simpler we do see now though if i start n equals zero
here and start with an x to the power zero there here i start with an x to the power negative one
that's not going to help me i've got to take the first term out of this summation so that this also
starts i'm going to have x to the power r let's take the first n equals zero out so it's going to be c
sub zero r here two times zero zero so it's two r minus one divided by x and now you can already see
the insidual equation coming out there and the insidual roots i should say indicial i should say
instead of indicial roots an equation coming out there so that's the first term taken out plus now
it starts at n equals one because i've already taken the zero out to infinity of i still have this whole
thing left c sub n n plus r let's have the two n plus two r minus one x to the power n minus one
plus the sum of n equals zero to infinity of c sub n n plus r plus one x to the power n equals zero so
now we can see if i start at one one minus one is zero this will start at x zero and this one starts at
x zero so i can introduce a term k equals n minus one and here k equals n in other words n equals k plus
one let's substitute those in i think they've got cut off there so i'm just sorry for the wobbliness
k equals n minus one k equals n so we'll have x to the power r we still have this c sub zero r
two r minus one divided by x plus so if n equals one that means k equals zero to infinity of c sub
well n is k plus one n plus r but n is k plus one so it's k plus r plus one k plus r plus one
and here we're going to have instead of that n i'm using k plus one so that's two k plus two
so that's a two k plus two minus one so that's a plus one in the end and this is still a plus two r
and we have x to the power k plus the sum of k equals zero to infinity of c sub k
we're going to have k plus r plus one x to the power k equals zero so we can eventually now
add these two together this is still c sub zero times r times two r minus one divided by x plus
i'm adding these two together now k equals zero to infinity what can i take out as a common factor
well only the x to the power k i'm left with c k plus one i'm left with a k plus r plus one i'm left with
the two k plus two r plus one and on this side i'm left with a positive c k with a k plus r plus
one could have taken that out as well of course and that equals zero so let's have a look if all of
this has to be zero this term must be zero and this term must be zero it doesn't help to make c sub
zero zero if for for for any of the values here to be zero the numerator must be zero so c sub zero
r two r minus one is going to be zero it doesn't help to make c sub zero zero so i'm left with this
indicial in this seal indicial equation of r times two r minus one equaling zero that's on the one side
so i can very quickly see i'm going to have an r sub one equals one over two and i'm going to have an
r sub two equaling zero as i'm going to make my two roots my two exponents i should say my indicial
roots on this side what's going to happen well just look at it i'm going to have a c k plus one on the
other side i'm going to have so if this all has got to be zero take the zero over to this over to the
other side it becomes negative c k i have a k plus r plus one in the numerator but look i also have a
dividing this now on this side a k plus r plus one on this side two k plus two r plus one
so these two are going to cancel out and that's what i'm left with so let's have r sub one in
there first i'm going to have c sub k plus one equals negative c sub k and i'm going to have two k
plus two times r that's just one plus another one so that's two on this side
let's finish this c sub k plus one is going to equal negative c sub k and i'm going to have a
two k plus two or two times k plus one on this side what's going to happen on this side the ck plus
one is going to equal negative c sub k and i'm putting zero in there so this is going to be two k plus
one on this one on that side so again i'm going to have these two i'm going to have these two set
series let's start with k equals zero so i'm going to have c sub one equals negative c sub zero zero plus
that so it's just divided by two so that's just divided by two let's do k equals one let's do k equals
two let's see k equals one is going to be c sub two equals negative c sub one divided by if i put one
in there one plus one one plus one is two so this is two times two or a two squared but look at this
i know what c sub one is it's negative that so that leaves me with c sub two and i'm going to have
two squared times two so let's do c sub three equals negative c sub two divided by if i put two in there
is three that's two times three but i already know what c sub two is it's that so i'm left with negative
c sub zero i'm going to have two to the power three times two times three times two times three
and i think what you can very quickly see how we're going to have the c sub n being remember if you want
to put this in there it's it's um it's a negative one to the power n that you put in there because to
the zero that's just one to the power one is a negative to the power two is positive so you swing
back between negative positive negative positive it's always going to be c sub zero on this side
irrespective of and what's happening here well it's going to be two to the power in because two to the
power zero is this one two to the power two two to the power three and this is one i can put an extra
times one in there and extra times one in there and extra times one in there which is this two
i should say n factorial as n grows n factorial so this was actually an easy one to see what happens to
c sub n let's do this k equals zero here it means c sub one is going to be equal negative c sub two
zero divided by so that's just one let's put the one in there c sub two is going to be equal negative
c sub one divided by now i put a one in there it's two three so that's three i suppose i can also say
one times three but well there's the one in there it is negative that so it's c sub zero divided by one
times three c sub three is going to equal negative c sub two divided by i put a two in there it's four
it's five so that's negative c sub zero over one times three times five so this c sub n is also easy
in in other words if it always goes positive negative positive negative positive just start with a
to start with that it's always going to be a c sub zero and what's happening to the
to this well it's one times three times five times etc etc etc and eventually we're going to have two
n minus one it's always that so it's three three times two is six six minus one is five so the next
one would be seven for four because four times two is eight minus one is seven so that's how you grow that
one so if we think about it if we thought that that that the equation was c sub n well n equals zero to
infinity now i'm sure you didn't see this one in the corner there you can pause the video and just
look at it this would be clearly how we construct this uh x to the power n plus r or if i take that
x to the power r out and have n equals zero to infinity of c sub n x to the power n what am i going to
have i'm going to have i'm going to have this and if i expand this i'm going to have c sub zero
x to the power zero c sub one x to the power one plus c sub two x squared c sub three x cubed
and all of this is multiplied by x to the power r and r sub one is a half let's put that in that's a half
times all of this but i can put values in for this let's put values in for that so it still remains
x to the power half now c sub zero is c sub zero that's just left as it is c sub one is now something
else that is now c sub zero divided by two square times um
uh two prime now that becomes a negative because was it uh where's that c sub zero that c sub one
and c sub one was a negative remember c sub two was going to be a positive c sub zero now remember that
x still has to be there uh divided by two to the power three three prime x squared
and then the same is going to happen for y sub two remember we're going to have x to the power
zero and then we're also going to have c sub zero and then a negative c sub zero x over something
something something so you can write those two values we can immediately divide everything by c sub zero
just to bring that c sub zero out so this was in the ending going to be one plus one half x plus this
and then one plus and this one's going to be an x etc etc etc etc or you can just bring in this notation
it was very easy for us to do the c sub n so c sub n times x to the power n we'll just have to put
another in there and we'll have to put the summation n equals zero to infinity and x to the power r in front
so that was going to be very easy to construct the two power series in the end as far as y sub one and
y sub two is concerned these are actually two easy ones to set up as a series
