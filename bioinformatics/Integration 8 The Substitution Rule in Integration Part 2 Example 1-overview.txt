To find the indefinite integral of \(\sqrt{5x - 1}\) with respect to \(x\), we can use substitution. The key idea is to identify a function and its derivative within the expression.

1. **Identify Substitution**: 
   - Let \(u = 5x - 1\). Then, the derivative \(du/dx = 5\), or equivalently, \(du = 5 \, dx\).

2. **Adjust the Integral**:
   - The integral \(\int \sqrt{5x - 1} \, dx\) becomes \(\int \sqrt{u} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \, du\) because \(dx = \frac{1}{5} \, du\).

3. **Integrate**:
   - The integral simplifies to \(\frac{1}{5} \int u^{1/2} \, du\).
   - Integrate using the power rule: \(\int u^{n} \, du = \frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\).
   - Here, \(n = 1/2\), so \(\int u^{1/2} \, du = \frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2} + C = \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} + C\).

4. **Substitute Back**:
   - Substitute \(u = 5x - 1\) back into the expression: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3} (5x - 1)^{3/2} + C = \frac{2}{15} (5x - 1)^{3/2} + C
   \]

Thus, the indefinite integral of \(\sqrt{5x - 1}\) with respect to \(x\) is:
\[
\frac{2}{15} (5x - 1)^{3/2} + C
\] 

This process demonstrates how substitution can simplify integration by recognizing a function and its derivative within the integrand.
