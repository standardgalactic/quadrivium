The text outlines an alternative method to solve differential equations, contrasting it with the superposition principle. This method involves several key steps:

1. **Complementary Solution**: Start by solving the homogeneous equation \( y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0 \) using its auxiliary equation, resulting in a complementary solution of the form \( c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 e^{-2x} \).

2. **Annihilating Operator**: Apply an annihilator to convert the non-homogeneous differential equation into a homogeneous one. Here, the operator \( d^3 \) is used on both sides, transforming the problem.

3. **Auxiliary Equation Revisited**: Solve the modified auxiliary equation \( m^3 + 3m^2 + 2m = 0 \). The roots guide the structure of the solution: \( c_1 + c_2 x + c_3 x^2 + c_4 e^{-x} + c_5 e^{-2x} \).

4. **Particular Solution**: Identify that the particular solution is inherently part of the form derived from the annihilator method, distinguishing this approach by not altering existing complementary terms.

5. **Solving for Coefficients**: Substitute into the original equation to determine coefficients \( a, b, c \), ensuring alignment with the non-homogeneous term \( 4x^2 \).

The primary distinction is that the complementary solution is integrated within the total solution, and the particular solution is directly derived using the annihilator method without modifying existing terms.
