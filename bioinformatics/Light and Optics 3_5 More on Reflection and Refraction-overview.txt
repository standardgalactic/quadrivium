The text provides a detailed explanation on using sign conventions in optics for determining the nature and characteristics of images formed by mirrors. The speaker emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between convex and concave mirrors using specific sign conventions: 

- For concave mirrors, \( R \) (the radius of curvature) is negative.
- For convex mirrors, \( R \) is positive.

These conventions simplify calculations related to image properties such as orientation (inverted or upright), type (real or virtual), magnification (\( M \)), and position (\( S_i \)):

1. **Concave Mirror Example**:
   - The focal length (\( F \)) is given as 12 cm, making the radius of curvature \( R = -2F = -24 \) cm (or -0.24 m).
   - For an object placed between the focal point and the mirror, the image formed is real, inverted, and magnified.
   - Using the formula for image distance (\( S_i \)) and magnification (\( M \)), calculations confirm these properties.

2. **Convex Mirror Example**:
   - Here, \( R \) is positive (0.20 m), leading to a negative focal length.
   - Images formed are virtual, upright, diminished in size, and located behind the mirror.
   - Calculations using the sign conventions again validate these characteristics.

The text highlights that while some textbooks may not use these specific sign conventions, adhering to them allows for straightforward determination of image properties. The speaker underscores that following a consistent convention helps avoid confusion and simplifies understanding optical systems.
