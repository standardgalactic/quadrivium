The text provides a detailed explanation on using sign conventions in optics for determining the nature and characteristics of images formed by mirrors. The speaker emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between convex and concave mirrors using specific sign conventions: 

- For concave mirrors, \( R \) (the radius of curvature) is negative.
- For convex mirrors, \( R \) is positive.

These conventions simplify calculations related to image properties such as orientation (inverted or upright), type (real or virtual), magnification (\( M \)), and position (\( S_i \)):

1. **Concave Mirror Example**:
   - The focal length (\( F \)) is given as 12 cm, making the radius of curvature \( R = -2F = -24 \) cm (or -0.24 m).
   - For an object placed between the focal point and the mirror, the image formed is real, inverted, and magnified.
   - Using the formula for image distance (\( S_i \)) and magnification (\( M \)), calculations confirm these properties.

2. **Convex Mirror Example**:
   - Here, \( R \) is positive (0.20 m), leading to a negative focal length.
   - Images formed are virtual, upright, diminished in size, and located behind the mirror.
   - Calculations using the sign conventions again validate these characteristics.

The text highlights that while some textbooks may not use these specific sign conventions, adhering to them allows for straightforward determination of image properties. The speaker underscores that following a consistent convention helps avoid confusion and simplifies understanding optical systems.

The text discusses conventions used in optics for handling calculations involving concave and convex mirrors. The author highlights the importance of using specific sign conventions (positive for convex mirrors and negative for concave mirrors) to simplify determining whether images formed are real or virtual, inverted or upright.

When analyzing optical systems:

1. **Conventions**:
   - For concave mirrors: Use a negative radius (R).
   - For convex mirrors: Use a positive radius (R).

2. **Effects of Conventions**:
   - These conventions help in quickly determining the nature and orientation of images formed.
   - Without these, you must manually consider each scenario to determine image characteristics.

3. **Example Calculations**:
   - **Concave Mirror**: If an object is between the focal point (F) and a concave mirror, it forms a real, inverted image on the same side as the object.
     - Example: Given R = -0.24 meters, calculations show that the magnification is negative (-2), indicating an enlarged but inverted image.
   - **Convex Mirror**: Always produces virtual, upright, and diminished images regardless of object placement.
     - Example: With R = +0.20 meters, results in a positive magnification (0.56), indicating a reduced yet upright image.

4. **Importance**:
   - Using these sign conventions allows for straightforward computation and understanding of optical outcomes.
   - Textbooks might not use the same conventions, so one must adapt calculations accordingly if following different standards. 

In summary, adhering to specific sign conventions when analyzing concave and convex mirrors facilitates easier interpretation of optical phenomena like image orientation and reality.
