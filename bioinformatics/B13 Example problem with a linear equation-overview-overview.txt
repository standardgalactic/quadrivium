The text introduces non-elementary integrals through the error function (erf) and the complementary error function (erfc), which arise from integrals involving \( e^{-x^2} \) or \( \sin(x^2) \), as these cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

- **Error Function**: Defined by
  \[
  \text{erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt
  \]

- **Complementary Error Function**: Defined by
  \[
  \text{erfc}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt
  \]

A key property of these functions is that their sum equals 1 for any \( x \):
\[
\text{erf}(x) + \text{erfc}(x) = 1
\]

When evaluating the error function at infinity:
\[
\text{erf}(\infty) = 1
\]
This is because:
\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-t^2} \, dt = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

These functions are important in applied mathematics, especially in probability and statistics. Understanding them is crucial for solving related problems.
