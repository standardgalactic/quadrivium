The text discusses composing and differentiating functions, specifically in the context of vector-valued functions. It introduces a function \( f(x, y) = y e^x \) and a vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (\cos(t), \sin(t)) \). The goal is to find the derivative of the composition of these two functions with respect to time \( t \).

The text outlines two methods for finding this derivative, focusing on Method 1. This method involves:

1. Calculating the gradient of \( f(x, y) \):
   - Partial derivative with respect to \( x \): \( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (y e^x) = y e^x \)
   - Partial derivative with respect to \( y \): \( \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (y e^x) = e^x \)

2. Evaluating the gradient at the vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \):
   - Replace \( x \) with \( \cos(t) \) and \( y \) with \( \sin(t) \)
   - Resulting in: \( (\sin(t) e^{\cos(t)}, e^{\cos(t)}) \)

3. Finding the derivative of the vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \):
   - Derivative: \( \mathbf{r}'(t) = (-\sin(t), \cos(t)) \)

4. Taking the dot product of the evaluated gradient and \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \):
   - Dot product: \( (\sin(t) e^{\cos(t)}, e^{\cos(t)}) \cdot (-\sin(t), \cos(t)) \)

This process effectively uses the chain rule for vector functions, resulting in a single value derivative with respect to time.

The text discusses two methods for finding the derivative of the composition of functions, specifically when dealing with a function \( f(x, y) = e^x \cdot y \), where \( x = \cos(t) \) and \( y = \sin(t) \).

### Method 1: Using Gradients
1. **Gradient Calculation**: Compute the gradient of \( f \), which involves partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( y \).
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = y e^x \)
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = e^x \)

2. **Chain Rule Application**: Use the chain rule by taking the dot product of the gradient with the derivatives of \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \).
   - Derivatives: \( \frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin(t) \), \( \frac{dy}{dt} = \cos(t) \)

3. **Result**: Combine these to find:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dt}[f(x(t), y(t))] = \left( y e^x \right)(-\sin(t)) + \left( e^x \right)(\cos(t))
   \]
   Substituting \( x = \cos(t) \) and \( y = \sin(t) \):
   \[
   -(\sin^2(t))e^{\cos(t)} + (\cos(t))e^{\cos(t)}
   \]

### Method 2: Direct Chain Rule
1. **Partial Derivatives**: As in Method 1, calculate:
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = y e^x \)
   - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = e^x \)

2. **Direct Application of the Chain Rule**:
   - Multiply each partial derivative by the corresponding derivative of \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \):
     \[
     \frac{d}{dt}[f(x(t), y(t))] = \left( y e^x \right)(-\sin(t)) + \left( e^x \right)(\cos(t))
     \]

3. **Result**: This yields the same expression as Method 1:
   \[
   -(\sin^2(t))e^{\cos(t)} + (\cos(t))e^{\cos(t)}
   \]

Both methods ultimately yield the same result, demonstrating different approaches to applying the chain rule for derivatives of composite functions.

The text discusses evaluating a composite function and its derivative at a specific point. Initially, it mentions replacing certain values with \(\pi/2\), resulting in a single constant value. The main example involves two functions: \(f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\) and a vector \(r(t) = (1 - 1/t, 1 + 1/t)\). To find the derivative of the composition at \(t = 1\), the following steps are taken:

1. **Gradient of \(f\)**: Calculated as \(\nabla f(x, y) = (2x, 2y)\).

2. **Substitute \(r(t)\) into \(\nabla f\)**:
   - Replace \(x\) with \(1 - 1/t\) and \(y\) with \(1 + 1/t\), resulting in the gradient at \(r(t)\): 
     \((2(1 - 1/t), 2(1 + 1/t)) = (2 - 2/t, 2 + 2/t)\).

3. **First derivative of \(r(t)\)**:
   - Calculated as \(r'(t) = (-1/t^2, 1/t^2)\).

4. **Dot product**:
   - Compute the dot product of \(\nabla f(r(t))\) and \(r'(t)\):
     \((2 - 2/t)(-1/t^2) + (2 + 2/t)(1/t^2)\).
   - Simplifying, this results in: 
     \(-2/t^2 + 2/t^3 + 2/t^2 + 2/t^3 = 4/t^3\).

5. **Evaluate at \(t = 1\)**:
   - The result is \(4/1^3 = 4\), but due to a sign error in simplification, it should be \(-4\).

Thus, the derivative of the composite function evaluated at \(t = 1\) is \(-4\).

The text discusses composing and differentiating functions, specifically when \( n = 2 \). It provides an example where \( f(x, y) = y e^x \) and a vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (\cos t, \sin t) \).

To find the derivative of the composed function with respect to \( t \), two methods are mentioned:

**Method 1:**

1. **Gradient of \( f \):**
   - Compute the gradient of \( f(x, y) \):
     \[
     \nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) = (y e^x, e^x)
     \]
   - Evaluate this at the vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (\cos t, \sin t) \):
     \[
     \nabla f(\mathbf{r}(t)) = (\sin t \cdot e^{\cos t}, e^{\cos t})
     \]

2. **Derivative of the vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \):**
   - Compute \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \):
     \[
     \mathbf{r}'(t) = (-\sin t, \cos t)
     \]

3. **Dot Product:**
   - Take the dot product of \( \nabla f(\mathbf{r}(t)) \) and \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \):
     \[
     (\sin t \cdot e^{\cos t}, e^{\cos t}) \cdot (-\sin t, \cos t) = -\sin^2 t \cdot e^{\cos t} + \cos t \cdot e^{\cos t}
     \]

This result gives the derivative of the composed function with respect to \( t \).

The text discusses two methods for finding the derivative of a composed function, specifically \( f(x, y) = e^x \cdot y \), where \( x = \cos(t) \) and \( y = \sin(t) \).

### Method One:
1. **Gradient Approach**:
   - Compute the gradient of \( f \): 
     - Partial derivative with respect to \( x \): \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = e^x \cdot y \)
     - Partial derivative with respect to \( y \): \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = e^x \)
   - Use the chain rule in vector form:
     - The derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( t \) is given by the dot product of the gradient and the derivatives of \( x \) and \( y \) with respect to \( t \):
     \[
     \frac{df}{dt} = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt} \right)
     \]
   - Calculate:
     - \( \frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin(t) \)
     - \( \frac{dy}{dt} = \cos(t) \)
   - Substitute and simplify to get:
     \[
     \frac{df}{dt} = (-\sin^2(t)) \cdot e^{\cos(t)} + (\cos(t)) \cdot e^{\cos(t)}
     \]

### Method Two:
1. **Chain Rule**:
   - Directly apply the chain rule for each variable:
   \[
   \frac{df}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt}
   \]
   - Substitute the partial derivatives and derivatives of \( x \) and \( y \):
     - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = e^x \cdot y = e^{\cos(t)} \cdot \sin(t) \)
     - \( \frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin(t) \)
     - \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = e^x = e^{\cos(t)} \)
     - \( \frac{dy}{dt} = \cos(t) \)
   - Substitute and simplify to get the same result:
     \[
     \frac{df}{dt} = (-\sin^2(t)) \cdot e^{\cos(t)} + (\cos(t)) \cdot e^{\cos(t)}
     \]

Both methods yield the same derivative for the composition of the function, demonstrating different approaches to applying the chain rule.

The text describes a mathematical process involving the composition of functions and evaluating derivatives at a specific point. Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Condition**: The discussion begins with \( t = \frac{\pi}{2} \), but this detail seems to be an introduction rather than central to the problem.

2. **Functions and Composition**:
   - A function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \).
   - A vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (1 - \frac{1}{t}, 1 + \frac{1}{t}) \).

3. **Objective**: Calculate the derivative of the composition of these functions at \( t = 1 \).

4. **Steps**:
   - Compute the gradient of \( f(x, y) \), which is \( (2x, 2y) \).
   - Substitute \( x = 1 - \frac{1}{t} \) and \( y = 1 + \frac{1}{t} \) into the gradient to get \( (2 - \frac{2}{t}, 2 + \frac{2}{t}) \).
   - Find the derivative of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), resulting in \( (-\frac{1}{t^2}, -\frac{1}{t^2}) \).

5. **Dot Product**:
   - Calculate the dot product of the gradient at \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) and the derivative of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \).
   - This results in: 
     \[
     (2 - \frac{2}{t})(-\frac{1}{t^2}) + (2 + \frac{2}{t})(-\frac{1}{t^2})
     \]
   - Simplify to get:
     \[
     -\frac{4}{t^3}
     \]

6. **Evaluation at \( t = 1 \)**:
   - Substitute \( t = 1 \) into the expression, yielding \(-4\).

Thus, the derivative of the composition at \( t = 1 \) is \(-4\).
