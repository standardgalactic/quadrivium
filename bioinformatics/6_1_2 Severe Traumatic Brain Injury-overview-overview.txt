The management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves several critical steps starting from pre-hospital care following Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles. Key aspects include maintaining systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg and oxygen saturation over 90% for patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 3 and 8, through intravenous fluid resuscitation and supplemental oxygen or intubation. Intubation is necessary to prevent airway deterioration, alongside spine protection.

Upon hospital admission, a CT scan should be performed if there's any loss of consciousness history, serving as both standard care and for legal reasons. Patients with mild or moderate TBI require close monitoring in a trauma unit with neurochecks every 15 minutes to detect signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Routine blood tests and tetanus prophylaxis are recommended.

In cases of severe TBI with symptoms, spine CT is advised if spinal tenderness exists. Management strategies for ICP include controlled ventilation and mannitol administration; steroids are not effective. An ICP monitor should be placed in patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 3 to 8, particularly if they have abnormal CT findings or specific criteria on a normal CT scan.

The text highlights the importance of monitoring ICP for early detection of increases and managing interventions like draining cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebral perfusion pressure is crucial, calculated as mean blood pressure minus ICP, with an optimal target around 60 mmHg to prevent complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome from fluid overload. Interventions to decrease ICP should begin when pressures exceed 20-25 mmHg, guided by the use of an ICP monitor.
