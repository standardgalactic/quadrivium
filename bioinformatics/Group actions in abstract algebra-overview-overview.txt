Here's a summary of the provided explanation about group actions and an illustrative example:

### Group Action Overview

1. **Group and Set**:
   - A group \( G \) consists of elements with operations satisfying closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.
   - A set \( A \) is simply a collection of distinct objects.

2. **Action Definition**:
   - A group \( G \) acts on a set \( A \) via a function \( \sigma: G \times A \to A \) that satisfies:
     1. **Identity**: For all \( a \in A \), the identity element \( e \) of \( G \) leaves \( a \) unchanged (\( \sigma(e, a) = a \)).
     2. **Compatibility**: For any elements \( g_1, g_2 \in G \) and \( a \in A \), applying \( g_1 \) after \( g_2 \) is the same as applying their product: \( \sigma(g_1, \sigma(g_2, a)) = \sigma(g_1g_2, a) \).

### Properties of Group Actions

- **Identity Property**: Ensures that the identity element acts trivially on any set element.
- **Compatibility Property**: Guarantees associativity in how group elements interact with the set.

### Permutations and Faithfulness

- Each \( g \in G \) induces a permutation of \( A \).
- An action is **faithful** if different group elements result in distinct permutations, allowing all group elements to be distinguished by their action on \( A \).

### Cayley's Theorem

- Every group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on itself, providing a concrete representation of abstract groups.

### Example: Group Action via Permutations

1. **Permutations Defined**:
   - \(\tau_1 = (1 \ 2)\): Swaps 1 and 2.
   - \(\sigma = (1 \ 2 \ 3)\): Cycles 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 back to 1.

2. **Action on an Element**:
   - Consider \( a = 2 \).
   - Compute \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma(2)\):
     - Apply \(\sigma\): \(\sigma(2) = 3\).
     - Then apply \(\tau_1\): \(\tau_1(3) = 3\) (3 remains unchanged).

3. **Result of Composition**:
   - The composition \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma\) results in the permutation \((2 \ 3)\).

4. **Verification**:
   - Confirm that \(\tau_1 \circ \sigma\) matches \(\tau_3 = (2 \ 3)\).
   - For each element, check: \( \tau_3(2) = 3 \), consistent with the composition result.

### Conclusion

- This example demonstrates how group elements act as permutations on a set, illustrating a faithful action where distinct group elements correspond to different permutations. It exemplifies the principles of group actions and their application in understanding permutation groups.
