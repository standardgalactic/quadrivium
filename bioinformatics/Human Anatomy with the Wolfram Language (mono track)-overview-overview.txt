The text outlines a new human anatomy course led by Jean Klopper at the University of Cape Town, emphasizing his commitment to integrating medical education and surgical research through innovative teaching methods. Jean intends to use the Wolfram language, particularly Mathematica, as a tool for visualizing human anatomy, arguing that coding is increasingly vital in healthcare.

Key elements of the course include:

1. **Educational Approach**: Jean plans to teach students how to visualize anatomy using simple lines of code, making learning interactive and effective.
2. **Wolfram Language Features**: The course will highlight Mathematica's capabilities for integrating built-in medical knowledge into its coding environment.
3. **Practical Applications**: Students will engage in practical exercises involving biostatistics and data visualization, such as creating histograms and conducting statistical tests.

The text also details the broader utility of Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha:

- **Mathematica** is showcased for its rich features in statistical analysis and data visualization, with specific functions like `EntityValue` aiding exploration.
- **Wolfram Alpha** is presented as a powerful tool for accessing information through natural language queries across various domains including science, nutrition, demographics, and anatomy.

The discussion underscores the potential of these computational tools to enhance both medical education and research by making complex data more accessible and interactive. The author expresses enthusiasm about combining anatomical studies with programming skills, hoping to continue developing educational content in future lectures using Mathematica's visualization capabilities.
