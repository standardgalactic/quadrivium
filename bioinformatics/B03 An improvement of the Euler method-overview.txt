The text explains predictor-corrector methods for solving differential equations, building on Euler's method. Initially, it describes how Euler's method can underestimate the true solution due to its simple linear approximation between points. The slope at each step is determined by plugging in values from the previous point into the given function.

To improve accuracy, a predictor-corrector approach is introduced. This involves predicting a new slope using the results of Euler’s method and then averaging this predicted slope with the original one obtained via Euler's method to obtain a corrected value. Specifically, the process entails:

1. Using Euler’s method to calculate an initial point \((x_1, y_1)\).
2. Calculating a new slope at this point using the function.
3. Averaging this new slope with the original slope from Euler's method.
4. Using the average slope to find a corrected \(y\) value, termed as \(y_{n+1}^*\).

This approach is known as an improved Euler’s method or second-order method because it uses two slopes for greater accuracy. The key formula for finding the corrected value involves taking the previous point's \(y\)-value and adding to it a term that includes both the original slope and this new, predicted slope, averaged together.

The text illustrates how this method iteratively refines estimates by reducing error through averaging, leading to solutions closer to the true curve of the differential equation.
