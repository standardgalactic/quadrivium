The text explains how to calculate the area between two curves using integration. By viewing functions \( f \) and \( g \) on a graph, one can determine the area between them by subtracting the lower curve (\( g \)) from the upper curve (\( f \)) at each point \( x \). This difference gives the height of rectangles used in the approximation process.

Midpoint sums are employed to approximate this area. Each rectangle has a width of \(\Delta x\) and a height equal to \(f(x) - g(x)\). The area of each rectangle is then calculated as \((f(x) - g(x)) \times \Delta x\).

Summing the areas of all rectangles across the interval results in an expression written using sigma notation. To find the exact area between the two curves, we take the limit of these sums as the number of rectangles (\(n\)) approaches infinity, leading to a definite integral that represents this area over the specified interval.

The text explains how to calculate the area between two curves represented by functions \( f \) and \( g \). By using midpoint sums, you create rectangles where the height is determined by the difference \( f(x_k) - g(x_k) \), and the width remains constant as \(\Delta x\). The area of each rectangle is therefore \( (f(x_k) - g(x_k)) \times \Delta x \). Summing these areas for all rectangles gives a sigma notation expression. By taking the limit as the number of rectangles \( n \) approaches infinity, you obtain an exact formula for the area between the two curves over a specified interval.
