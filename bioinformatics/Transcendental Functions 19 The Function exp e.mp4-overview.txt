The text introduces Euler's number \( e \) raised to the power of \( x \), emphasizing its role in calculus, particularly in derivatives and integrals. It defines the natural logarithm (\(\ln(x)\)) as a definite integral from 1 to \( x \) of \( 1/t \, dt \). The function \( f(x) = \ln(x) \) has an inverse, which is defined as \( e^x \), meaning \( e \) raised to the power of the natural log of \( x \) equals \( x \).

The text illustrates this with examples: \( e^{\ln(A)} = A \). For instance, using a calculator, taking the natural log of 2 (an irrational number) and raising \( e \) to that power gives back 2. This demonstrates the powerful relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions.

Examples provided show how to simplify expressions involving these functions:
- \( e^{\ln(2)} = 2 \).
- For a more complex expression like \( e^{\ln(x^2 - x - 6)} \), it simplifies directly to \( x^2 - x - 6 \).

This highlights the concept that exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses, allowing for such direct transformations.
