The text analyzes sequences as they approach infinity, focusing on convergence or divergence. It begins by examining the sequence:

\[ 
a_n = \frac{n^2 + 4}{2n + 7} 
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), this forms an indeterminate \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\). Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of \( n \) in the denominator gives:

\[ 
a_n = \frac{n + \frac{4}{n}}{2 + \frac{7}{n}} 
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), this simplifies to approximately \(\frac{n}{2}\), which diverges to infinity. The text explains that sequences can also be considered divergent if they oscillate, like \( (-1)^n \).

It discusses the relationship between function convergence and sequence convergence: a continuous function \( f(x) \) converging as \( x \to \infty \) implies its sequence \( f(n) \) converges. However, this does not work in reverse.

An example with:

\[ 
f(x) = \frac{x+1}{e^x} 
\]

is provided, where L'Hôpital's Rule shows convergence to 0 for both the function and its sequence as \( x \to \infty \).

The text outlines methods to determine sequence or series convergence:

1. **L'Hôpital's Rule**: Applied when limits are indeterminate forms like \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\) by differentiating numerator and denominator.

2. **Squeeze Theorem**: Compares a sequence between two others that converge to the same limit, such as showing \(\sin(n)/n^2\) converges to 0.

3. **Corollary of Squeeze Theorem**: If the absolute value of a sequence converges to zero, so does the original sequence. An example is \((-1)^n/n\), where \(|(-1)^n/n|\) becomes \(1/n\), which converges to 0.

The text emphasizes understanding these methods and knowing when each applies, especially distinguishing between L'Hôpital's Rule (for specific limits) and the Squeeze Theorem corollary (for zero-converging limits). Arithmetic operations on sequence limits follow similar rules as with functions, with caution regarding division by zero.
