The text provides examples of solving logarithmic equations:

1. **First Example:**
   - Equation: \(\log_2(x) + 2 + \log_2(x) = 3\).
   - Steps:
     - Combine logs using properties: \(\log_2(x^2) + 2 = 3\).
     - Rewrite constant as a log: \(2 = \log_2(4)\), so equation becomes \(\log_2(x^2) + \log_2(4) = 3\).
     - Combine logs: \(\log_2(4x^2) = 3\).
     - Convert to exponential form: \(4x^2 = 8\).
     - Solve the polynomial: \(x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0\) factors to \((x+4)(x-2)=0\), giving solutions \(x = -4\) or \(x = 2\).
     - Domain restriction (logs require positive arguments): Solution is \(x = 2\).

2. **Second Example:**
   - Equation: \(25^{2x+1} = 15\).
   - Steps:
     - Take the logarithm of both sides: \(\log(25^{2x+1}) = \log(15)\).
     - Use power rule: \((2x+1) \cdot \log(25) = \log(15)\).
     - Solve for \(x\): 
       - Isolate \(2x + 1\): \(2x + 1 = \frac{\log(15)}{\log(25)}\).
       - Subtract 1: \(2x = \frac{\log(15)}{\log(25)} - 1\).
       - Divide by 2: \(x = \frac{(\log(15) / \log(25)) - 1}{2}\).
     - Use a calculator to find the numerical value of \(x\).

These examples illustrate solving logarithmic and exponential equations using properties of logs, conversion between forms, and domain considerations.
