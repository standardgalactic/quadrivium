The next special element that might exist in a set that I want to talk to you about very quickly
is just the inverse element.
The inverse element.
Inverse element.
Let's just have a look at that.
So again we're going to have a set of elements x.
We're going to have a binary operation on that.
Let's make it that.
And we have to have an identity element.
So there must be an identity element here.
My identity element we're just going to make that u.
Just that identity element.
And now I'm going to have two elements in that set.
x sub 1 and x sub 2 they are elements of my set.
And I'm going to say, I'm going to define again as human beings we define it this way.
We decided that x2 is an inverse element of x1 if the following holds.
So x2 is an inverse element of the following, if the following holds.
That if I take this binary operation.
That is going to equal this basically.
But that equals, the important bit is that this equals the back to the identity element.
A nice example, a very easy example.
If we just take the set, our set to be the rational, the rational numbers.
Let's say that my element that I'm looking at x1 is 3.
What would be under my binary operation being multiplication?
Multiplication.
What would it be?
Well, if that is 3 then this has got to be a third.
Because 3 times a third equals 1.
And we defined 1 under this for this set.
Under this binary operation we defined this as the identity element which we have there.
So that is our definition of an inverse element.
So.
