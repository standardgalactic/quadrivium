The text discusses a video that explains how to calculate pressure at various depths within a fluid or in the air using principles of fluids at rest. The analysis involves an imaginary cylinder inside a fluid container, focusing on forces acting upon it: gravitational force downward, pressure from above pushing down, and greater pressure below pushing up.

In static equilibrium (net force is zero), these forces balance according to \( F_2 = F_1 + mg \). Substituting the definitions of pressure into this equation gives:

\[ P_2 \times A = P_1 \times A + \rho \times g \times A \times (Y_2 - Y_1) \]

Here:
- \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) are pressures at heights \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \),
- \( \rho \) is the fluid density,
- \( g \) is gravitational acceleration,
- \( A \) is the surface area of the cylinder,
- \( H = (Y_2 - Y_1) \) is the height difference between two levels.

The equation shows that pressure at any depth depends on initial pressure, fluid density, gravitational acceleration, and vertical distance. This principle also applies to air pressure changes with altitude, where pressure decreases linearly if density remains constant. These equations are essential for understanding fluid mechanics in static conditions.
