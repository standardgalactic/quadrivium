The text explains the process of dividing complex numbers, which involves two key concepts: the complex conjugate and the modulus.

### Complex Conjugate
- A complex number \( z = a + bi \) has a complex conjugate denoted as \( \overline{z} = a - bi \).
- Reflecting a vector representing \( z \) across the real axis yields its conjugate.
- Example: The conjugate of \( 3 - 4i \) is \( 3 + 4i \).

### Modulus
- The modulus (or absolute value) of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is given by \( |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
- It represents the length or magnitude of the vector in the complex plane.
- Example: For \( z = -1 \), the modulus is 1.

### Division of Complex Numbers
To divide two complex numbers, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
1. Let \( z_1 = a + bi \) and \( z_2 = c + di \).
2. The division \( \frac{z_1}{z_2} \) is performed by multiplying by \( \overline{z_2} = c - di \):
   \[
   \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}
   \]
3. Simplify the denominator to \( c^2 + d^2 \), which is \( |z_2|^2 \).
4. The result is:
   \[
   \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}
   \]

### Example
Divide \( z = 1 + 4i \) by \( w = 1 - 2i \):
- Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \( w \), which is \( 1 + 2i \).
- Compute:
  \[
  \frac{(1 + 4i)(1 + 2i)}{(1 - 2i)(1 + 2i)}
  \]
- Simplify to find the result.

This method ensures that the division results in a complex number in standard form.

The text explains a process involving complex numbers and their operations. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The equation involves \( z = z_1 \times z_2 \) and \( z_2^2 \). It simplifies to \( z_1 \).

2. **Complex Number Multiplication**: 
   - Given \( z_1 = 3 + 4i \) and \( z_2 = 1 + 2i \), the task is to multiply \( z_1 \) by the complex conjugate of \( z_2 \).
   - The complex conjugate of \( z_2 \) is \( 1 - 2i \).

3. **Modulus and Division**:
   - Calculate the modulus squared of \( z_2 \), which is \( 1^2 + (-2)^2 = 5 \).
   - Multiply \( z_1 \) by the conjugate of \( z_2 \): 
     \[
     (3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = 3 \times 1 + 3 \times (-2i) + 4i \times 1 + 4i \times (-2i)
     \]
   - Simplify: 
     \[
     = 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2
     \]
   - Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
     \[
     = 3 - 6i + 4i + 8 = 11 - 2i
     \]

4. **Final Division**:
   - Divide by the modulus squared of \( z_2 \):
     \[
     \frac{11 - 2i}{5} = \frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i = 2.2 - 0.4i
     \]

5. **Linear Equations with Complex Numbers**:
   - The text mentions using Cramer's rule to solve linear equations involving complex numbers.
   - For Cramer's rule, the determinant of matrix \( A \) must be non-zero, ensuring the matrix is invertible.

The process demonstrates multiplying complex numbers and applying Cramer's rule in systems with complex coefficients.

The text describes the process of solving a linear system using matrices. The matrix of coefficients is given as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
i & 2 \\
4 & -i
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To check if this matrix is invertible, its determinant is calculated using the formula for a 2x2 matrix: \( \text{det} = AD - BC \).

The determinant calculation proceeds as follows:

\[
\text{det} = (i)(-i) - (2)(4) = (-i^2) - 8 = -(1) - 8 = -9
\]

Since the determinant is non-zero (\(-9\)), the matrix is invertible, and Cramer's Rule can be applied to solve the system.

Next, two new matrices \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) are constructed by replacing columns of the original coefficient matrix with the column vector \(B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\):

- \(A_1\) is formed by replacing the first column:

\[
A_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
-1 & -i
\end{bmatrix}
\]

- \(A_2\) is formed by replacing the second column:

\[
A_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
i & 1 \\
4 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinants of these matrices are then calculated to solve for the variables using Cramer's Rule. The determinant of \(A_1\) is computed as:

\[
\text{det}(A_1) = (1)(-i) - (2)(-1) = -i + 2
\]

The process would continue with calculating \(\text{det}(A_2)\) and using these determinants to find the solution to the system.

The text describes solving a system of linear equations using determinants and Cramer's Rule, focusing on calculations involving complex numbers.

1. **Determinant Calculations**: The process involves computing determinants for matrices \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \), as well as the determinant of matrix \( A \). Complex numbers are used throughout, particularly with imaginary unit \( I \).

2. **Complex Arithmetic**:
   - \( I^2 = -1 \).
   - Expressions like \( 2I^2 \) become negative because \( 2(-1) = -2 \).
   - Terms such as \( -2I \), \( -6I \), and simplifications involving complex numbers are handled.

3. **Cramer's Rule Application**:
   - The solution for \( X \) is found by dividing the determinant of \( A_1 \) by the determinant of \( A \).
   - Similarly, \( Y \) is calculated by dividing the determinant of \( A_2 \) by the determinant of \( A \).

4. **Results**:
   - \( X = I \)
   - \( Y = 1 - I \)

The text emphasizes writing out all steps to ensure accuracy and mentions using Cramer's Rule as a method for solving systems with complex numbers.
