The text explains the process of dividing complex numbers, which involves two key concepts: the complex conjugate and the modulus.

### Complex Conjugate
- A complex number \( z = a + bi \) has a complex conjugate denoted as \( \overline{z} = a - bi \).
- Reflecting a vector representing \( z \) across the real axis yields its conjugate.
- Example: The conjugate of \( 3 - 4i \) is \( 3 + 4i \).

### Modulus
- The modulus (or absolute value) of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is given by \( |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
- It represents the length or magnitude of the vector in the complex plane.
- Example: For \( z = -1 \), the modulus is 1.

### Division of Complex Numbers
To divide two complex numbers, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
1. Let \( z_1 = a + bi \) and \( z_2 = c + di \).
2. The division \( \frac{z_1}{z_2} \) is performed by multiplying by \( \overline{z_2} = c - di \):
   \[
   \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}
   \]
3. Simplify the denominator to \( c^2 + d^2 \), which is \( |z_2|^2 \).
4. The result is:
   \[
   \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}
   \]

### Example
Divide \( z = 1 + 4i \) by \( w = 1 - 2i \):
- Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \( w \), which is \( 1 + 2i \).
- Compute:
  \[
  \frac{(1 + 4i)(1 + 2i)}{(1 - 2i)(1 + 2i)}
  \]
- Simplify to find the result.

This method ensures that the division results in a complex number in standard form.

The text explains a process involving complex numbers and their operations. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The equation involves \( z = z_1 \times z_2 \) and \( z_2^2 \). It simplifies to \( z_1 \).

2. **Complex Number Multiplication**: 
   - Given \( z_1 = 3 + 4i \) and \( z_2 = 1 + 2i \), the task is to multiply \( z_1 \) by the complex conjugate of \( z_2 \).
   - The complex conjugate of \( z_2 \) is \( 1 - 2i \).

3. **Modulus and Division**:
   - Calculate the modulus squared of \( z_2 \), which is \( 1^2 + (-2)^2 = 5 \).
   - Multiply \( z_1 \) by the conjugate of \( z_2 \): 
     \[
     (3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = 3 \times 1 + 3 \times (-2i) + 4i \times 1 + 4i \times (-2i)
     \]
   - Simplify: 
     \[
     = 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2
     \]
   - Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
     \[
     = 3 - 6i + 4i + 8 = 11 - 2i
     \]

4. **Final Division**:
   - Divide by the modulus squared of \( z_2 \):
     \[
     \frac{11 - 2i}{5} = \frac{11}{5} - \frac{2}{5}i = 2.2 - 0.4i
     \]

5. **Linear Equations with Complex Numbers**:
   - The text mentions using Cramer's rule to solve linear equations involving complex numbers.
   - For Cramer's rule, the determinant of matrix \( A \) must be non-zero, ensuring the matrix is invertible.

The process demonstrates multiplying complex numbers and applying Cramer's rule in systems with complex coefficients.

The text describes the process of solving a linear system using matrices. The matrix of coefficients is given as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
i & 2 \\
4 & -i
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To check if this matrix is invertible, its determinant is calculated using the formula for a 2x2 matrix: \( \text{det} = AD - BC \).

The determinant calculation proceeds as follows:

\[
\text{det} = (i)(-i) - (2)(4) = (-i^2) - 8 = -(1) - 8 = -9
\]

Since the determinant is non-zero (\(-9\)), the matrix is invertible, and Cramer's Rule can be applied to solve the system.

Next, two new matrices \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) are constructed by replacing columns of the original coefficient matrix with the column vector \(B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\):

- \(A_1\) is formed by replacing the first column:

\[
A_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
-1 & -i
\end{bmatrix}
\]

- \(A_2\) is formed by replacing the second column:

\[
A_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
i & 1 \\
4 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinants of these matrices are then calculated to solve for the variables using Cramer's Rule. The determinant of \(A_1\) is computed as:

\[
\text{det}(A_1) = (1)(-i) - (2)(-1) = -i + 2
\]

The process would continue with calculating \(\text{det}(A_2)\) and using these determinants to find the solution to the system.

The text describes solving a system of linear equations using determinants and Cramer's Rule, focusing on calculations involving complex numbers.

1. **Determinant Calculations**: The process involves computing determinants for matrices \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \), as well as the determinant of matrix \( A \). Complex numbers are used throughout, particularly with imaginary unit \( I \).

2. **Complex Arithmetic**:
   - \( I^2 = -1 \).
   - Expressions like \( 2I^2 \) become negative because \( 2(-1) = -2 \).
   - Terms such as \( -2I \), \( -6I \), and simplifications involving complex numbers are handled.

3. **Cramer's Rule Application**:
   - The solution for \( X \) is found by dividing the determinant of \( A_1 \) by the determinant of \( A \).
   - Similarly, \( Y \) is calculated by dividing the determinant of \( A_2 \) by the determinant of \( A \).

4. **Results**:
   - \( X = I \)
   - \( Y = 1 - I \)

The text emphasizes writing out all steps to ensure accuracy and mentions using Cramer's Rule as a method for solving systems with complex numbers.

The text provides a guide to dividing complex numbers, beginning with the concept of a complex conjugate. A complex number \( z = a + bi \) has a conjugate denoted as \( \overline{z} = a - bi \), achieved by reflecting the number across the real axis in the complex plane (viewed as vectors in \( R^2 \)). This reflection changes the sign of the imaginary part.

The modulus or absolute value of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is defined as \( |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), representing the length of the vector from the origin to the point \( (a, b) \).

To divide one complex number by another, say \( \frac{z_1}{z_2} \), you multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. This process eliminates the imaginary part in the denominator:

\[ \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{z_1 \cdot \overline{z_2}}{z_2 \cdot \overline{z_2}} = \frac{z_1 \cdot \overline{z_2}}{|z_2|^2} \]

Here, \( |z_2|^2 = z_2 \cdot \overline{z_2} \) (the square of the modulus of \( z_2 \)) ensures a real number in the denominator.

The text provides an example: dividing \( z + 4i \) by \( 1 - 2i \). The process involves multiplying both by the conjugate of the denominator, \( 1 + 2i \), leading to:

\[ \frac{(z + 4i)(1 + 2i)}{(1 - 2i)(1 + 2i)} = \frac{(z + 4i)(1 + 2i)}{1^2 + (2)^2} = \frac{(z + 4i)(1 + 2i)}{5} \]

This multiplication and division simplify the expression into a complex number in standard form. The text highlights this as an illustrative example of dividing two complex numbers by using conjugates to clear the denominator.

The text outlines a method for solving equations involving complex numbers. It starts with an equation where \( z \) is equal to the product of two terms: \( z_1 \times z_2 \) and \( z_2^2 \). The solution involves multiplying \( z_1 = 3 + 4i \) by the complex conjugate of \( z_2 = 1 + 2i \), which is \( 1 - 2i \), and dividing by the modulus squared of \( z_2 \).

The calculation proceeds as follows:
- Multiply \( (3 + 4i) \times (1 - 2i) \).
- The result is calculated step-by-step, yielding a real part of \(-5\) and an imaginary part of \(10i\).
- This complex number is then divided by the modulus squared of \( z_2 \), which is \( 5 \).

The final result for this operation is \(-1 + 2i\).

Additionally, the text mentions using Cramer's rule to solve a system of linear equations involving complex numbers. It emphasizes checking that the determinant of the coefficient matrix (denoted as \( A \)) is non-zero, ensuring that Kramer's rule can be applied. This step confirms that the matrix is invertible, which is necessary for finding solutions using this method.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of working with matrices and determinants. Here's a summary:

1. **Matrix of Coefficients**: The matrix under consideration is a \(2 \times 2\) matrix, specifically:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} I & 2 \\ 4 & -I \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   where \(I\) represents the imaginary unit.

2. **Determinant Calculation**: The determinant of this matrix is calculated using the formula for a \(2 \times 2\) matrix: \(AD - BC\).
   \[
   \text{det}(A) = (I)(-I) - (2)(4) = -I^2 - 8 = 1 - 8 = -7
   \]
   Since the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is invertible.

3. **Schröder's Rule**: The text indicates that Schröder's rule can be applied because the determinant of the coefficient matrix does not equal zero.

4. **New Matrices \(A_1\) and \(A_2\)**:
   - **Matrix \(A_1\)** is formed by replacing the first column of \(A\) with a column vector \(B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\):
     \[
     A_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -1 & -I \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - **Matrix \(A_2\)** is formed by replacing the second column of \(A\) with the same vector \(B\):
     \[
     A_2 = \begin{bmatrix} I & 1 \\ 4 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
     \]

5. **Determinants of New Matrices**:
   - The determinant of \(A_1\) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{det}(A_1) = (1)(-I) - (2)(-1) = -I + 2
     \]

The text outlines the process of setting up and solving a system using matrices, determinants, and Schröder's rule to determine solutions for linear equations.

The text appears to be an explanation of solving a system of linear equations using determinants, likely within the context of complex numbers. Here's a summary:

1. The problem involves calculating determinants for matrices \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), and \( A \).
2. Complex numbers are used in calculations, specifically involving \( I \) (the imaginary unit where \( I^2 = -1 \)).
3. Step-by-step calculations show how to simplify expressions involving these complex numbers:
   - For example, multiplying by \( 2I \) leads to simplifications like \( 2I^2 = -2 \).
4. The text describes calculating the determinant of matrix \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \), leading to results involving imaginary components.
5. Using Cramer's rule, solutions for variables \( X \) and \( Y \) are derived:
   - \( X = I \)
   - \( Y = 1 - I \)
6. The process emphasizes writing out all steps clearly to avoid mistakes.

Overall, the text is a detailed walkthrough of solving a system involving complex numbers using determinants and Cramer's rule.
