The text provides a detailed explanation of applying Green's Theorem to evaluate a line integral over a closed curve. Here’s a summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: We need to evaluate a line integral for a vector field \( \mathbf{f} = (2x e^y, 2x^2 e^y) \) along a closed curve composed of two sections: \( y = x^2 - 2 \) and \( y = x \).

2. **Checking Conservativeness**: The text checks if the vector field is conservative by calculating its curl (\( n_x - m_y \)). Since the curl is not zero, the vector field is non-conservative.

3. **Applying Green's Theorem**: Because the vector field is non-conservative, Green’s Theorem is used to convert the line integral into a double integral over the region \( R \) enclosed by the curve:
   \[
   \oint_C (m \, dx + n \, dy) = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \right) \, dA
   \]

4. **Integration Process**: The text describes setting up the double integral over the region bounded by \( y = x^2 - 2 \) and \( y = x \). The integration involves:
   - Calculating the curl: \( \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial m}{\partial y} \).
   - Evaluating the double integral using appropriate limits for \( x \) and \( y \).

5. **Integration by Parts**: For part of the integration, integration by parts is used to simplify the expression.

6. **Final Calculation**: The text goes through detailed calculations, including substitutions and simplifications, leading to the final result of the integral.

The overall process demonstrates how Green's Theorem can be applied to evaluate line integrals for non-conservative vector fields by converting them into double integrals over a specified region.
