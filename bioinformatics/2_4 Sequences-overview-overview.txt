The text analyzes the sequence \( a_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n + 2}{3n - 1} \) to determine its convergence or divergence as \( n \to \infty \). Here's a summary of the analysis:

1. **Oscillating Factor**: The term \((-1)^n\) causes the sequence to oscillate, alternating between positive and negative values depending on whether \( n \) is even or odd.

2. **Rational Expression Behavior**: By dividing both numerator and denominator by \( n \), the expression \(\frac{n + 2}{3n - 1}\) simplifies to \(\frac{1 + \frac{2}{n}}{3 - \frac{1}{n}}\). As \( n \to \infty \), this approaches \(\frac{1}{3}\).

3. **Combined Sequence Behavior**: The sequence becomes approximately \( a_n \approx (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1}{3} \) as \( n \to \infty \), oscillating between \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(-\frac{1}{3}\).

4. **Conclusion on Convergence**: Due to its oscillatory nature without settling at a single value, the sequence diverges.

The text also briefly discusses broader concepts related to sequences and limits:

- **Oscillation and Convergence**: Sequences can have different convergence behaviors depending on their structure, such as squared terms in denominators.
  
- **L'HÃ´pital's Rule**: This rule is used for resolving indeterminate forms involving exponentials, like \( x e^{-x} \) as \( x \to \infty \), showing it converges to 0.

- **Exponential Ratios and Limits**: Sequences with ratios of exponential functions can be analyzed using differentiation, often leading to convergence to zero.

The overall discussion highlights techniques for determining sequence behavior, focusing on simplifying indeterminate forms and understanding the properties of exponentials and limits.
