The talk focuses on biliary tree tumors, which are relatively rare. These tumors typically affect slightly older individuals with a male predominance and often present as painless jaundice. The biliary tree is divided into three parts for tumor classification: lower third, middle third, and upper third (around the hilum).

Tumors in the lower and middle thirds are more common, accounting for over half of cases. When located below where the common hepatic duct and cystic duct merge to form the common bile duct, these tumors can lead to gallbladder distension known as Courvoisier's signâ€”characterized by a painless, enlarged gallbladder in jaundiced patients. Symptoms also include nausea, weight loss, malaise, pruritus, dark urine, and pale stools due to obstructive jaundice.

Upper third tumors are classified into types 1-4 based on their location relative to the hilum and common bile duct, with types 3 and 4 inside the liver. Unlike lower third tumors, upper third tumors do not present with Courvoisier's sign.

Imaging techniques like CT scans, MRIs, and MRCPs are essential for confirming diagnosis and delineating anatomy. Treatment primarily involves surgical resection to achieve clear margins, with prognosis improving for distal tumors that are easier to detect and remove. Resectability is crucial, often assessed via laparoscopy after imaging studies.

These surgeries can be extensive: pancreaticoduodenectomy for lower third tumors or major liver resections for upper third tumors, sometimes involving bile duct reconstruction. The presence of local invasion or peritoneal deposits identified during laparoscopy may alter the treatment approach. Understanding these anatomical and clinical details is vital for addressing biliary tree carcinomas effectively.
