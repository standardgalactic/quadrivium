The text discusses determining if two planes are parallel by analyzing their normal vectors. The equations of the planes are given in vector form as \(\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0}) = 0\). It notes that one plane's normal vector is a scalar multiple (specifically, -2) of the other, indicating they are parallel because their direction vectors are proportional.

The text then describes how to find an equation for a plane through a point and perpendicular to a line given in polar coordinates. To solve this, it suggests constructing two vectors: one along the line and another from a known point on the plane to any arbitrary point on that plane. The dot product of these vectors is set to zero since they are perpendicular, leading to an equation for the plane.

Finally, the text briefly explains how to derive equations for planes parallel to the \(XY\) plane and the \(XY\) plane itself. A plane parallel to the \(XY\) plane has a normal vector in the \(Z\)-direction (\(0, 0, 1\)), resulting in an equation of the form \(z = c\). The equation for the \(XY\) plane is simply \(z = 0\), as it lies flat on the \(X-Y\) axis with no displacement along the \(Z\) direction.

The text describes how different planes in a three-dimensional coordinate system are defined based on their orientation:

1. **XZ Plane**: Defined by setting \( Y = 0 \). Points on this plane have coordinates \((x, 0, z)\).

2. **YZ Plane**: Defined by setting \( X = 0 \). Points on this plane have coordinates \((0, y, z)\).

3. **Plane Parallel to XY Plane**: A plane parallel to the XY plane can be defined by a constant value of \( Z \), such as \( Z = Z_0 \). Any point on this plane has coordinates \((x, y, Z_0)\).

4. **General Planes**:
   - For planes parallel to the YZ plane, they can be expressed with an equation like \( X = X_0 \).
   - The XY plane itself is defined where \( Z = 0 \), and any point on it has coordinates \((X_0, Y_0, 0)\).

5. **Unit Vectors**: 
   - Along the Z-axis: \((0, 0, 1)\)
   - Along the X-axis: \((1, 0, 0)\)
   - Along the Y-axis: \((0, 1, 0)\)

6. **Parallel Planes and Equation Formulation**: 
   - You can define parallel planes by allowing constants like \( Z_0 \) to vary.
   - The equation of a plane can be formulated using the normal vector (perpendicular unit vector to the plane). For example, for a plane perpendicular to the XY plane, you would use the Z-axis unit vector.

Overall, the text explains how different planes are characterized by setting one coordinate constant and describes how to represent these planes with vectors.
