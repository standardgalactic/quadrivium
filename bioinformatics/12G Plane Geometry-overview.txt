The text discusses determining if two planes are parallel by analyzing their normal vectors. The equations of the planes are given in vector form as \(\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0}) = 0\). It notes that one plane's normal vector is a scalar multiple (specifically, -2) of the other, indicating they are parallel because their direction vectors are proportional.

The text then describes how to find an equation for a plane through a point and perpendicular to a line given in polar coordinates. To solve this, it suggests constructing two vectors: one along the line and another from a known point on the plane to any arbitrary point on that plane. The dot product of these vectors is set to zero since they are perpendicular, leading to an equation for the plane.

Finally, the text briefly explains how to derive equations for planes parallel to the \(XY\) plane and the \(XY\) plane itself. A plane parallel to the \(XY\) plane has a normal vector in the \(Z\)-direction (\(0, 0, 1\)), resulting in an equation of the form \(z = c\). The equation for the \(XY\) plane is simply \(z = 0\), as it lies flat on the \(X-Y\) axis with no displacement along the \(Z\) direction.

The text describes how different planes in a three-dimensional coordinate system are defined based on their orientation:

1. **XZ Plane**: Defined by setting \( Y = 0 \). Points on this plane have coordinates \((x, 0, z)\).

2. **YZ Plane**: Defined by setting \( X = 0 \). Points on this plane have coordinates \((0, y, z)\).

3. **Plane Parallel to XY Plane**: A plane parallel to the XY plane can be defined by a constant value of \( Z \), such as \( Z = Z_0 \). Any point on this plane has coordinates \((x, y, Z_0)\).

4. **General Planes**:
   - For planes parallel to the YZ plane, they can be expressed with an equation like \( X = X_0 \).
   - The XY plane itself is defined where \( Z = 0 \), and any point on it has coordinates \((X_0, Y_0, 0)\).

5. **Unit Vectors**: 
   - Along the Z-axis: \((0, 0, 1)\)
   - Along the X-axis: \((1, 0, 0)\)
   - Along the Y-axis: \((0, 1, 0)\)

6. **Parallel Planes and Equation Formulation**: 
   - You can define parallel planes by allowing constants like \( Z_0 \) to vary.
   - The equation of a plane can be formulated using the normal vector (perpendicular unit vector to the plane). For example, for a plane perpendicular to the XY plane, you would use the Z-axis unit vector.

Overall, the text explains how different planes are characterized by setting one coordinate constant and describes how to represent these planes with vectors.

The text discusses determining whether two planes are parallel by comparing their normal vectors. The equations of the planes in vector form indicate that if one normal vector is a scalar multiple of the other, then the planes are parallel.

1. **Parallel Planes:**
   - Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are scalar multiples of each other.
   - In this case, \( \mathbf{n}_1 = -2 \times \mathbf{n}_2 \), indicating that the planes are indeed parallel because their normals point in the same direction.

2. **Equation of a Plane through a Point Perpendicular to a Line:**
   - To find such an equation when given a line in parametric form, you identify two points on the line and create vectors.
   - The dot product of the vector from a known plane point to any point on this line with another vector on the line is zero if they are perpendicular.

3. **Equation of a Plane Parallel to the XY Plane:**
   - A plane parallel to the XY plane has an equation \( Z = \text{constant} \).
   - The normal vector for such planes points along the Z-axis, i.e., (0, 0, 1).

4. **Equation of the XY Plane Itself:**
   - The XY plane is described by \( Z = 0 \), as all points on this plane have a Z-coordinate of zero.

In summary, determining parallelism involves comparing normal vectors, and equations for planes relative to coordinate axes are derived based on their orientation and position in space.

The text explains how to define planes in a 3D coordinate system:

1. **XZ Plane**: This is where \( Y = 0 \). Any point on this plane will have coordinates \((x, 0, z)\).

2. **YZ Plane**: Here, \( X = 0 \), so any point will be \((0, y, z)\).

3. **XY Plane**: Defined by \( Z = 0 \). Points are of the form \((x, y, 0)\). You can choose any values for \( x \) and \( y \), but \( z \) must always be zero.

4. **Parallel Planes**:
   - For a plane parallel to the YZ plane: It is defined by \( X = X_0 \).
   - For a plane parallel to the XY plane: Defined by \( Z = Z_0 \).

5. **Unit Vectors**: 
   - Along the Z-axis (for XY plane): \((0, 0, 1)\)
   - Along the X-axis: \((1, 0, 0)\)
   - Along the Y-axis: \((0, 1, 0)\)

6. **Parallel Planes with Specific Points**: You can define parallel planes by choosing specific values for \( Z_0 \) or other coordinates and use unit vectors to determine directions perpendicular to these planes.

7. **Equation of a Plane**: The equation can be formed using the dot product of a normal vector (perpendicular to the plane) and a position vector, allowing for various transformations like scaling.
