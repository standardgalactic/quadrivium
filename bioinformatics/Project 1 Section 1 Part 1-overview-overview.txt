This text describes a Julia programming project centered around introductory medical statistics, designed to guide participants through conducting a basic medical research study using the platform juliabox.org. Key steps include formulating a research question, performing literature searches, determining study type and necessary variables, establishing hypotheses, developing protocols with ethics approval, creating an anonymous data collection tool, and importing datasets into Julia for analysis. The project emphasizes starting with a well-defined research question to guide all subsequent activities. Resources are available on GitHub for those who prefer not to create everything independently.
