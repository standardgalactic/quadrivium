Here is a concise summary of the provided text on compartment syndrome:

1. **Introduction**: Compartment syndrome is a rare condition, more prevalent in males (7.3 per 100,000) than females (<1 per 100,000), involving increased pressure within muscle compartments that impairs blood flow.

2. **Definition and Etiology**:
   - It arises when compartmental pressures are high enough to obstruct capillary perfusion, causing tissue anoxia and cell death.
   - Causes include traumatic events (e.g., fractures, crush injuries) and non-traumatic conditions (e.g., burns, acute insulin states).
   - Risk factors include hypovolemia, prior ischemic insults, increased metabolic demand, venous insufficiency, and spinal epidural anesthesia.

3. **Pathophysiology**:
   - The condition results from injury-induced tissue swelling, raising compartment pressure.
   - Compromised arteriovenous gradients lead to reduced capillary flow when blood supply can't meet tissue demands.
   - Key factors include vascular tone, systemic blood pressure, duration of high pressure, and metabolic requirements.

4. **Pressure Thresholds**:
   - No absolute pressure threshold exists; diagnosis is based on differential pressures between arterial mean and intercompartmental pressures (e.g., less than 30 mmHg from mean arterial pressure).

5. **Time Course**:
   - Symptoms may develop hours to days post-injury.
   - Muscle ischemia can be tolerated for about two hours, with irreversible damage occurring after eight hours; similar timelines apply to nerves.

6. **Diagnosis**:
   - High suspicion is essential, especially in patients with predisposing factors like fractures (67% of cases), primarily affecting the tibia and distal radius.
   - "Six Ps" are diagnostic indicators, with pain being the most sensitive sign.

7. **Evaluation Focus**:
   - Pain and pressure are primary early signs; other symptoms such as pulselessness, paralysis, and paresthesia appear later and may indicate nerve injury.
   - For patients without significant underlying injuries, compartment syndrome is unlikely despite dense limbs or supple muscle compartments.

The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing pain and pressure for early detection while considering other late-appearing signs in assessing compartment syndrome.
