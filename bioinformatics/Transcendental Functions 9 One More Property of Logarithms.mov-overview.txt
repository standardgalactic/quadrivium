The text discusses a useful property of logarithms: changing the base of a logarithm. Specifically, if you have \(\log_a b\), it can be expressed as \(\frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}\) for any positive number \(c\) (where \(c \neq 1\)). This is helpful when calculating logarithms on calculators that typically only support base 10 or natural logs. For example, \(\log_3 4\) can be rewritten as either \(\frac{\log_{10} 4}{\log_{10} 3}\) (common log) or \(\frac{\ln 4}{\ln 3}\) (natural log), making it possible to compute using standard calculator functions.
