The passage you provided describes the process of radiocarbon dating using carbon-14 activity as an indicator of age. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and calculations involved:

1. **Carbon Dating Basics**:
   - Living organisms constantly exchange carbon with their environment, maintaining a constant level of carbon-14 (C-14) in their tissues.
   - Once an organism dies, it no longer absorbs C-14, and the existing C-14 begins to decay at a known rate.

2. **Decay Constant (\(\lambda\))**:
   - The decay constant is calculated using the formula: \(\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{\text{half-life}}\).
   - For carbon-14, with a half-life of approximately 5730 years, this was converted to seconds for precision in calculations.

3. **Activity (A)**:
   - Activity refers to the rate of decay, measured in Becquerels (Bq), where 1 Bq = 1 decay per second.
   - For a living organism today, the activity is calculated based on the known amount of C-14 and its decay constant.

4. **Calculating Age**:
   - The age of a sample can be determined by comparing its current activity to the expected activity when it was part of a living organism.
   - Using the formula derived from the exponential decay equation: \( t = \frac{\ln(\frac{A_0}{A})}{\lambda} \), where:
     - \( A_0 \) is the original activity (when the organism was alive).
     - \( A \) is the current measured activity.
     - \( \lambda \) is the decay constant.

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - Given: 
     - Original activity (\(A_0\)) = 0.23 Bq.
     - Current activity (\(A\)) = 1.21 Bq.
     - Decay constant (\(\lambda\)) = \(3.83 \times 10^{-12}\) s\(^{-1}\).
   - The age of the sample is calculated as:
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(\frac{0.23}{1.21})}{-3.83 \times 10^{-12}}
     \]
   - This results in an approximate age of 5,300 years.

6. **Considerations**:
   - The method assumes that the activity level of C-14 has been constant over time, which may not be accurate due to fluctuations in cosmic ray intensity and other factors.
   - The accuracy is generally reliable up to about 50,000 years, but discrepancies can occur for more precise dating beyond a few thousand years.

This process illustrates how radiocarbon dating provides estimates of the age of archaeological samples by measuring the decay of carbon-14.
