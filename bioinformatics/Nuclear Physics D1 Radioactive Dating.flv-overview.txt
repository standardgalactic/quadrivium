The passage you provided describes the process of radiocarbon dating using carbon-14 activity as an indicator of age. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and calculations involved:

1. **Carbon Dating Basics**:
   - Living organisms constantly exchange carbon with their environment, maintaining a constant level of carbon-14 (C-14) in their tissues.
   - Once an organism dies, it no longer absorbs C-14, and the existing C-14 begins to decay at a known rate.

2. **Decay Constant (\(\lambda\))**:
   - The decay constant is calculated using the formula: \(\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{\text{half-life}}\).
   - For carbon-14, with a half-life of approximately 5730 years, this was converted to seconds for precision in calculations.

3. **Activity (A)**:
   - Activity refers to the rate of decay, measured in Becquerels (Bq), where 1 Bq = 1 decay per second.
   - For a living organism today, the activity is calculated based on the known amount of C-14 and its decay constant.

4. **Calculating Age**:
   - The age of a sample can be determined by comparing its current activity to the expected activity when it was part of a living organism.
   - Using the formula derived from the exponential decay equation: \( t = \frac{\ln(\frac{A_0}{A})}{\lambda} \), where:
     - \( A_0 \) is the original activity (when the organism was alive).
     - \( A \) is the current measured activity.
     - \( \lambda \) is the decay constant.

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - Given: 
     - Original activity (\(A_0\)) = 0.23 Bq.
     - Current activity (\(A\)) = 1.21 Bq.
     - Decay constant (\(\lambda\)) = \(3.83 \times 10^{-12}\) s\(^{-1}\).
   - The age of the sample is calculated as:
     \[
     t = \frac{\ln(\frac{0.23}{1.21})}{-3.83 \times 10^{-12}}
     \]
   - This results in an approximate age of 5,300 years.

6. **Considerations**:
   - The method assumes that the activity level of C-14 has been constant over time, which may not be accurate due to fluctuations in cosmic ray intensity and other factors.
   - The accuracy is generally reliable up to about 50,000 years, but discrepancies can occur for more precise dating beyond a few thousand years.

This process illustrates how radiocarbon dating provides estimates of the age of archaeological samples by measuring the decay of carbon-14.

Let's break down the process and calculations described in your explanation:

### Understanding Radioactive Decay

Radioactive decay involves the transformation of an unstable atomic nucleus into a more stable one. This is often accompanied by the emission of particles or electromagnetic radiation. The rate at which a radioactive substance decays is characterized by its half-life—the time it takes for half of the original quantity to decay—and its decay constant (λ).

### Key Equations

1. **Radioactive Decay Formula**:
   \[
   N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
   \]
   - \(N(t)\): Number of undecayed nuclei at time \(t\)
   - \(N_0\): Initial number of nuclei
   - \(λ\): Decay constant
   - \(e\): Base of the natural logarithm

2. **Activity (A)**:
   \[
   A = λN
   \]
   - Activity is the rate at which decay events occur.

3. **Relating Activities**:
   If you have initial activity \(A_0\) and current activity \(A\), then:
   \[
   A = A_0 e^{-\lambda t}
   \]

4. **Decay Constant**:
   The relationship between the half-life (\(T_{1/2}\)) and decay constant is given by:
   \[
   λ = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}}
   \]
   
### Calculating the Age of a Specimen

In your example, you are estimating the age of skeletal remains based on their current carbon-14 activity.

#### Given Data
- Current activity (\(A\)) of the sample: \(1.21\) Becquerel (Bq)
- Activity in living organism (\(A_0\)): \(0.23\) Bq
- Decay constant (\(λ\)): \(3.83 \times 10^{-12}\) s\(^{-1}\)

#### Steps to Calculate Age

1. **Set Up the Equation**:
   \[
   A = A_0 e^{-\lambda t}
   \]
   
2. **Solve for Time (\(t\))**:
   \[
   \frac{A}{A_0} = e^{-\lambda t}
   \]

3. **Take the Natural Logarithm of Both Sides**:
   \[
   \ln \left(\frac{A}{A_0}\right) = -\lambda t
   \]

4. **Solve for \(t\)**:
   \[
   t = -\frac{\ln \left(\frac{A}{A_0}\right)}{\lambda}
   \]

5. **Substitute Known Values**:
   \[
   t = -\frac{\ln \left(\frac{1.21}{0.23}\right)}{3.83 \times 10^{-12}}
   \]

6. **Calculate \(t\)**:
   \[
   t = -\frac{\ln(5.26)}{3.83 \times 10^{-12}} 
   \]
   
   First, calculate the natural logarithm:
   \[
   \ln(5.26) \approx 1.6607
   \]

   Then calculate \(t\):
   \[
   t = -\frac{1.6607}{3.83 \times 10^{-12}} 
   \]
   
   \[
   t \approx 4.33 \times 10^{11} \text{ seconds}
   \]

7. **Convert Seconds to Years**:
   Since there are approximately \(31,536,000\) seconds in a year (considering leap years):
   \[
   t \approx \frac{4.33 \times 10^{11}}{31,536,000} 
   \]
   
   \[
   t \approx 13,740 \text{ years}
   \]

### Conclusion

The calculations suggest the skeletal remains are approximately \(13,740\) years old based on the current and initial activities provided. This estimation highlights the importance of understanding decay processes and the assumptions made in radiocarbon dating. Adjustments might be necessary for more precise historical context or environmental changes over millennia.
