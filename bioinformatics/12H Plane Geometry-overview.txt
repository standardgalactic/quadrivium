To find the equation of a plane that is perpendicular (or orthogonal) to both given planes:

1. **Identify Normals**: The normals of the two given planes are:
   - For \(4x - 2y + 2z = -1\), the normal vector is \(\mathbf{n_1} = \langle 4, -2, 2 \rangle\).
   - For \(3x + 3y - 6z = 5\), the normal vector is \(\mathbf{n_2} = \langle 3, 3, -6 \rangle\).

2. **Cross Product**: The cross product of these two vectors will give a vector that is perpendicular to both planes:
   \[
   \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{n_1} \times \mathbf{n_2} = 
   \begin{vmatrix}
   \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
   4 & -2 & 2 \\
   3 & 3 & -6
   \end{vmatrix}
   \]

   Calculate the determinant:
   \[
   \mathbf{n} = \langle (-2)(-6) - (2)(3), (2)(3) - (4)(-6), (4)(3) - (-2)(3) \rangle
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{n} = \langle 12 - 6, 6 + 24, 12 + 6 \rangle
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{n} = \langle 6, 30, 18 \rangle
   \]

3. **Simplify**: Simplify the normal vector:
   \[
   \mathbf{n} = \langle 1, 5, 3 \rangle
   \]

4. **Point on Plane**: Use a point through which the plane passes. Let's assume it is \(P_0 = (2, 1, 5)\).

5. **Equation of the Plane**: Using the point-normal form of the equation of a plane:
   \[
   n_x(x - x_0) + n_y(y - y_0) + n_z(z - z_0) = 0
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   1(x - 2) + 5(y - 1) + 3(z - 5) = 0
   \]

6. **Expand and Simplify**:
   \[
   x - 2 + 5y - 5 + 3z - 15 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x + 5y + 3z - 22 = 0
   \]

Thus, the equation of the plane is:
\[ 
x + 5y + 3z = 22 
\]

To solve the problem of finding the equation of a plane through a point that is perpendicular or orthogonal to both given planes, we can follow these steps:

### Given Planes:
1. \(4x - 2y + 2z = -1\)
2. \(3x + 3y - 6z = 5\)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Find the Normals of the Given Planes
The normal vector to a plane given by the equation \(ax + by + cz = d\) is \(\mathbf{n} = (a, b, c)\).

- For the first plane \(4x - 2y + 2z = -1\), the normal vector is \(\mathbf{n_1} = (4, -2, 2)\).
- For the second plane \(3x + 3y - 6z = 5\), the normal vector is \(\mathbf{n_2} = (3, 3, -6)\).

#### Step 2: Find a Vector Perpendicular to Both Normals
To find a vector perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{n_1}\) and \(\mathbf{n_2}\), we take the cross product:

\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{n_1} \times \mathbf{n_2}
\]

\[
\mathbf{n} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
4 & -2 & 2 \\
3 & 3 & -6
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating the determinant:

- The coefficient of \(\mathbf{i}\) is: \((-2)(-6) - (2)(3) = 12 - 6 = 6\)
- The coefficient of \(\mathbf{j}\) is: \(-(4(-6) - 2(3)) = -(24 - 6) = -18\)
- The coefficient of \(\mathbf{k}\) is: \(4(3) - (-2)(3) = 12 + 6 = 18\)

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\mathbf{n} = (6, -18, 18)
\]

This can be simplified by dividing by 6:

\[
\mathbf{n} = (1, -3, 3)
\]

#### Step 3: Use a Point on the Plane
Assume the plane passes through a point \(P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)\). For simplicity, let's use the origin \((0, 0, 0)\) unless specified otherwise.

#### Step 4: Write the Equation of the Plane
The equation of a plane with normal vector \(\mathbf{n} = (a, b, c)\) passing through point \(P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)\) is:

\[
a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{n} = (1, -3, 3)\) and \(P_0 = (0, 0, 0)\):

\[
1(x - 0) - 3(y - 0) + 3(z - 0) = 0
\]

Simplifying gives:

\[
x - 3y + 3z = 0
\]

This is the equation of the plane perpendicular to both given planes and passing through the origin. If a different point \(P_0\) is specified, substitute its coordinates into the equation.
