To install the `lifelines` package on macOS using Anaconda Python and IPython Notebook, additional steps are required due to missing Fortran libraries. Here’s a summarized guide:

1. **Install Xcode:** Begin by installing Xcode from the Mac App Store.

2. **Set Up GCC for GFortran:**
   - Visit `hpc.sourceforge.net` (High Performance Computing) and download the latest version of GCC.
   - Use Terminal to navigate to the Downloads directory (`cd ~/Downloads`) and extract the file using:
     ```bash
     gunzip GCC-<version>.tar.gz
     tar -xvf GCC-<version>.tar
     ```
   - Install GFortran with:
     ```bash
     cd GCC-<version>
     ./configure --enable-languages=f95,fortran
     make
     sudo make install
     ```

3. **Update System PATH:**
   - Edit your `.bashrc` or equivalent shell configuration file using `vi` or another text editor:
     ```bash
     sudo vi ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - Add the line to include GFortran in the PATH, then save and exit (`escape`, type `:wq`, and press Enter):
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/gcc/bin
     ```

4. **Install pip (if necessary):**
   - Ensure Python’s package manager is installed:
     ```bash
     sudo easy_install pip
     ```

5. **Install lifelines:**
   - With the Fortran libraries in place, install `lifelines` using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install lifelines
     ```
   - This should proceed without errors related to missing Fortran dependencies.

Following these steps allows you to use the `lifelines` library for Kaplan-Meier survival curves on a macOS system.
