To install the `lifelines` package on macOS using Anaconda Python and IPython Notebook, additional steps are required due to missing Fortran libraries. Here’s a summarized guide:

1. **Install Xcode:** Begin by installing Xcode from the Mac App Store.

2. **Set Up GCC for GFortran:**
   - Visit `hpc.sourceforge.net` (High Performance Computing) and download the latest version of GCC.
   - Use Terminal to navigate to the Downloads directory (`cd ~/Downloads`) and extract the file using:
     ```bash
     gunzip GCC-<version>.tar.gz
     tar -xvf GCC-<version>.tar
     ```
   - Install GFortran with:
     ```bash
     cd GCC-<version>
     ./configure --enable-languages=f95,fortran
     make
     sudo make install
     ```

3. **Update System PATH:**
   - Edit your `.bashrc` or equivalent shell configuration file using `vi` or another text editor:
     ```bash
     sudo vi ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - Add the line to include GFortran in the PATH, then save and exit (`escape`, type `:wq`, and press Enter):
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/gcc/bin
     ```

4. **Install pip (if necessary):**
   - Ensure Python’s package manager is installed:
     ```bash
     sudo easy_install pip
     ```

5. **Install lifelines:**
   - With the Fortran libraries in place, install `lifelines` using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install lifelines
     ```
   - This should proceed without errors related to missing Fortran dependencies.

Following these steps allows you to use the `lifelines` library for Kaplan-Meier survival curves on a macOS system.

To install the `lifelines` Python package on macOS using Anaconda and IPython Notebook, you need to address missing Fortran libraries by installing additional tools. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Xcode**: 
   - Download and install Xcode from the App Store.
   
2. **Download GCC (G4 Trend Compiler)**:
   - Visit [hpc.sourceforge.net](http://www.hpc.sf.net) for high-performance computing tools on Mac.
   - Download the latest version of the G4 Trend compiler.
   - In Terminal, navigate to the download directory using `cd Downloads`.
   - Extract the downloaded file: `gunzip GCC-<version>.tar.gz` and then `tar -xvf GCC-<version>.tar`.

3. **Install G4 Compiler**:
   - Navigate into the extracted directory: `cd GCC-<version>`.
   - Install using the command: `/path/to/GCC-<version>/install` (make sure to use a full path if necessary).

4. **Update System Path**:
   - Edit your `.bashrc` or equivalent shell configuration file by running `sudo vi ~/.bashrc`.
   - Add the G4 compiler to your PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/GCC-<version>/bin`.
   - Save and exit the editor, then reload with `source ~/.bashrc`.

5. **Install pip**:
   - If not already installed, set up Python's package manager by following instructions on installing pip for macOS.

6. **Install lifelines Package**:
   - With Fortran libraries now available, install `lifelines` using pip: `pip install lifelines`.
   - Ensure no errors occur due to missing libraries during installation.

By completing these steps, you can successfully use the `lifelines` library for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on a Mac running Anaconda and IPython Notebook.
