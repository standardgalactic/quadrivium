Here's a summarized explanation of how an invertible matrix \( A \) can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices:

1. **Elementary Matrices**: These are derived from the identity matrix by performing basic row operations: swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar, or adding/subtracting multiples of rows.

2. **Expressing \( A \)**:
   - By multiplying an invertible matrix \( A \) with a series of elementary matrices \( E_1, E_2, ..., E_k \), you can transform \( A \) into the identity matrix.
   - Thus, \( A \) can be expressed as the product of the inverses of these elementary matrices: \( A = E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}...E_k^{-1} \).

3. **Finding Elementary Matrices**:
   - Start with matrix \( A \) and an identity matrix of the same size.
   - Perform row operations on both to convert \( A \) into the identity matrix.
   - The corresponding transformations applied to the identity matrix yield the elementary matrices.

4. **Example (2x2 Matrix)**:
   - Begin with a 2x2 invertible matrix and an identity matrix.
   - Apply specific row operations, each resulting in an elementary matrix:
     - Dividing a row by a scalar.
     - Multiplying one row and subtracting from another.
     - Negating a row.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The sequence of these matrices (in reverse order) gives the inverse \( A^{-1} \).
   - This process allows any invertible matrix to be expressed as a product of elementary matrices, emphasizing careful application of row operations to avoid errors.

The method involves understanding and memorizing fundamental operations, constructing inverses through systematic applications, and verifying correctness by reversing the operations. This approach provides an efficient way to solve problems involving matrix inverses.
