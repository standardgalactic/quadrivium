The text explains how to handle cases where the degree of a polynomial in the numerator is equal to or greater than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator. This situation results in an "improper fraction," which can be managed through long division, similar to numerical fractions.

For instance, when dividing \(5\) by \(3\), you perform long division to rewrite it as \(1 + \frac{2}{3}\) or \(1\frac{2}{3}\). This concept is applied similarly to polynomials. Consider a fraction with \(x^3\) in the numerator and \(x^2 + x - 2\) in the denominator. 

First, multiply out the denominator and compare degrees. The degree of the numerator (\(3\)) is larger than that of the denominator (\(2\)). Perform polynomial long division:

1. Divide \(x^3\) by \(x^2\) to get \(x\).
2. Multiply \(x\) by the entire denominator \((x^2 + x - 2)\) and subtract from the numerator.
3. Continue dividing until the remainder's degree is less than that of the denominator.

The result is expressed as a "proper fraction" where the quotient (e.g., \(x - 1\)) represents the whole part, and the remainder over the original divisor forms the fractional part (\(\frac{3x - 2}{x^2 + x - 2}\)). This process ensures that the final expression has a numerator with a lower degree than the denominator.

This method allows converting an improper polynomial fraction into a proper one by separating it into a polynomial (quotient) and a proper fractional part.

The text discusses how to handle rational expressions where the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is equal to or greater than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator. This situation creates an "improper fraction." The solution involves using polynomial long division to convert this improper fraction into a sum of a polynomial (the quotient) and a proper fraction (where the degree of the numerator is less than that of the denominator).

Here's a step-by-step summary:

1. **Identify Degrees**: Recognize when the numerator's degree is greater than or equal to the denominator's degree, indicating an improper fraction.

2. **Polynomial Long Division**:
   - Perform long division with polynomials similarly to numerical long division.
   - Divide the leading term of the numerator by the leading term of the denominator to find the first term of the quotient.
   - Multiply the entire divisor by this term and subtract from the original polynomial, reducing its degree.

3. **Repeat**:
   - Continue dividing the resulting polynomial until the remainder has a lower degree than the denominator.

4. **Result**: 
   - The result is expressed as the sum of the quotient (a polynomial) and the proper fraction formed by the remainder over the original divisor.
   - This process effectively transforms an improper fraction into a more manageable form where the numerator's degree is less than that of the denominator.

5. **Example**:
   - The text uses numerical and algebraic examples to illustrate this method, including dividing \( \frac{5}{3} \) to show how it becomes \( 1 + \frac{2}{3} \).
   - For polynomials, it demonstrates dividing \( x^3 \) by \( x^2 + x - 2 \), resulting in a quotient and a remainder that form a proper fraction.

This method is essential for simplifying polynomial fractions and analyzing functions involving rational expressions.
