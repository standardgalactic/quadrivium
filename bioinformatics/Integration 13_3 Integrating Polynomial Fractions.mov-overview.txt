The text explains how to handle cases where the degree of a polynomial in the numerator is equal to or greater than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator. This situation results in an "improper fraction," which can be managed through long division, similar to numerical fractions.

For instance, when dividing \(5\) by \(3\), you perform long division to rewrite it as \(1 + \frac{2}{3}\) or \(1\frac{2}{3}\). This concept is applied similarly to polynomials. Consider a fraction with \(x^3\) in the numerator and \(x^2 + x - 2\) in the denominator. 

First, multiply out the denominator and compare degrees. The degree of the numerator (\(3\)) is larger than that of the denominator (\(2\)). Perform polynomial long division:

1. Divide \(x^3\) by \(x^2\) to get \(x\).
2. Multiply \(x\) by the entire denominator \((x^2 + x - 2)\) and subtract from the numerator.
3. Continue dividing until the remainder's degree is less than that of the denominator.

The result is expressed as a "proper fraction" where the quotient (e.g., \(x - 1\)) represents the whole part, and the remainder over the original divisor forms the fractional part (\(\frac{3x - 2}{x^2 + x - 2}\)). This process ensures that the final expression has a numerator with a lower degree than the denominator.

This method allows converting an improper polynomial fraction into a proper one by separating it into a polynomial (quotient) and a proper fractional part.
