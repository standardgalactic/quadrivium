The text describes transitioning from discussing an oscillatory motion with damping to incorporating an external driving force. The system involves a mass-spring setup experiencing both damping and an external force applied over time, \( f(t) \). The equation of motion is modified by including this driving force, leading to:

\[ m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = f(t), \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( c \) is the damping coefficient,
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( f(t) \) is the external driving force.

The equation is rearranged by dividing through by the mass \( m \), resulting in:

\[ \ddot{x} + 2\lambda \dot{x} + \omega^2 x = \frac{f(t)}{m}, \]

where:
- \( 2\lambda = \frac{c}{m} \),
- \( \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \),
- \( F(t) = \frac{f(t)}{m} \).

The text indicates that this setup will be solved in the next video to demonstrate its simplicity.

The text describes an extension of analyzing oscillatory motion by incorporating both damping forces and driving forces. The system under consideration involves a mass-spring setup experiencing damping as it oscillates, along with an external force applied to drive the oscillation.

To analyze this scenario mathematically:

1. **Starting Equation**: Begin with the standard equation for damped harmonic motion.
2. **Introducing Driving Force**: Add a driving force \( f(t) \), which is dependent on time, to the existing model.
3. **Formulating the New Equation**: The modified equation becomes:
   \[
   m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = f(t)
   \]
   where \( m \) is mass, \( c \) is the damping coefficient, and \( k \) is the spring constant.
4. **Simplification**: Divide every term by \( m \):
   \[
   \ddot{x} + 2\lambda\dot{x} + \omega^2 x = \frac{f(t)}{m}
   \]
   Here, \( 2\lambda = \frac{c}{m} \) and \( \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \). Define a new function for the driving force term: \( F(t) = \frac{f(t)}{m} \).
5. **Next Steps**: The text suggests solving this differential equation in the next session to demonstrate its ease of solution.

This setup prepares the ground for analyzing driven, damped oscillations and sets up a framework for solving such problems using standard methods for ordinary differential equations.
