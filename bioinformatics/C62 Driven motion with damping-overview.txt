The text describes transitioning from discussing an oscillatory motion with damping to incorporating an external driving force. The system involves a mass-spring setup experiencing both damping and an external force applied over time, \( f(t) \). The equation of motion is modified by including this driving force, leading to:

\[ m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = f(t), \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( c \) is the damping coefficient,
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( f(t) \) is the external driving force.

The equation is rearranged by dividing through by the mass \( m \), resulting in:

\[ \ddot{x} + 2\lambda \dot{x} + \omega^2 x = \frac{f(t)}{m}, \]

where:
- \( 2\lambda = \frac{c}{m} \),
- \( \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \),
- \( F(t) = \frac{f(t)}{m} \).

The text indicates that this setup will be solved in the next video to demonstrate its simplicity.
