The text discusses a scenario involving relativistic travel to a distant planet with astronauts traveling in a starship. Here's a summary:

1. **Travel Scenario**: A starship travels from Earth to a new planet at a constant velocity. It takes 9.2 years for the astronauts on board to reach their destination, but due to time dilation effects predicted by special relativity, an observer on Earth measures this journey as taking 15 years.

2. **Determining Distance**:
   - The text uses the relationship between proper time (\(\Delta T_0\)) and dilated time (\(\Delta T\)), where \(\Delta T = \frac{\Delta T_0}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\).
   - It calculates the velocity of the spaceship using these times: 
     \[
     v = c \times \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\Delta T_0}{\Delta T}\right)^2}
     \]
   - Given Earth's observation time (\(\Delta T\) is 15 years) and the astronauts' time (\(\Delta T_0\) is 9.2 years), they calculate the velocity.
   - Using this velocity, the distance to the planet is determined by \(d = v \times \Delta T\), resulting in a distance of approximately \(1.12 \times 10^{17}\) meters.

3. **Time Dilation Example with Bacteria**:
   - A bacterium that divides every day starts at one and reaches 256 after eight days on Earth.
   - If this experiment is conducted on a spaceship traveling at 0.66c, time dilation causes the process to appear slower from Earth's perspective.
   - The proper time (\(\Delta T_0\)) experienced by bacteria onboard is calculated as four days due to relativistic effects using:
     \[
     \Delta T_0 = \Delta T \times \sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}
     \]
   - Therefore, from Earth's viewpoint, when the count reaches 256 in eight days, the bacteria on the spaceship will have divided into 16.

The discussion illustrates how time dilation affects both interstellar travel and biological processes at relativistic speeds.
