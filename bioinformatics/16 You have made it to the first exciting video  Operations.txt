Now if you've made it this far, congratulations!
I told you in the beginning, this first stuff is absolutely...
If I say boring, I think many people are going to be angry at me because certainly
some of it is interesting, but you've got to wade through these things and you've got to wonder to yourself
where is all this going? Is it going to mean something?
This is abstract algebra, so when do I get to groups? But this is all the foundation
that we are building. I mean this is one way to study abstract algebra.
Build this foundation until you get to groups, rings, fields, all of these things
or you can just jump in there and then you have to attach all these things
onto it so that you can understand it properly. So in this
series we are just building it from the ground up which means in the beginning it's awkward
you don't know how to do it, you don't know why you are learning these things
it's just these definitions and abstract things that you've got to get together.
What I do want to say is congratulations you've made it till here because we are going to actually
get to one of the more interesting things although it is still part of the building blocks
and this thing that we are going to get to is called operations
and I don't just say operations and that means surgery and surgery is what I do for a living
it means operations are actually quite interesting
and you actually know operations before. The addition
of two numbers, the multiplication
of two numbers, those are operations
and operations
are nothing other
than this product set
onto itself so if I have a set
S
and I take its product set with S
with itself, what I am doing
is I am mapping S into S
so you know give me one element of S
I do some operation with another element of S
and what I am ended up
with is another element
that is just inside of S
I mean if you looked at the set of
if you look at the set of real numbers
and I told you
oh well let the operation be addition
and I am going to say well 2 plus 3
and that equals 5
well 2 is an element of R
if the real number was my S here
3 is an element of that
I do this operation to them
and I get 5 and 5 is also an element there
so we say that these operations are
or these sets are closed under a certain operation
so remember that term
you are going to come across it many times
it is closed under the operation
under the operation
that means that if I do that operation
on a set that I get to another element
that is also inside of that set
that is also inside of that set
so I am just mapping a set to itself
a product set
see how we build all of those things up
they mean something to us now
it means we have a better understanding
perhaps of what is going
of what is going on here
now the specific operations that we are really going to deal with
the more proper term for that
is going to be a binary operation
a binary operation
binary in as much as we are going to take this operator on two elements
so what we are going to then have
basically is this mapping
of a pair of those elements
so I could have said that this mapping here
under addition
is going to give me this operation
2 plus 3
and that is going to map to another element in that set
which is 5
now you will
come across
this idea that we move away from plus
and multiplication
and we build this generic operation
and we have signs for that
either it is a little circle
or it is a square block
you will see many of these stars sometimes
it just means that this is a binary operation
on that set
that arithmetic
and
everything that you learned before
functions
remember
let me talk about that
I mean we had a function f of x equals 3x
other words
y equals 3 of x
all I am doing
is I am building these product sets
I am building these product sets
you give me 1 and 3
and I say well that maps to 3
so this is an r
this is an r
this is an r
but I want to move away from this being a function
I want to move to something more generic
which is a mapping
because that allows us to map all sorts of brilliant things
I mean
mapping of divisible by
for instance
or just arbitrary mappings between elements of a set
it is so much richer than just sticking to functions
but you were told about
you were told what functions are
you work with functions
but just see that as part of something
a much bigger and a much more exciting world
so let's just look at a few operations
so one that I have listed here is
the addition
let's take
the even natural numbers under addition
I am just going to write that
they are closed
closed under addition
why?
because I can take
any two elements
in that set
so 2 plus 4
that is going to give me 6
and 6 is also in that set
if I look at the
odd natural numbers
under addition
if I look at the odd
natural numbers
under addition
that is certainly not closed under addition
1 plus 3 gives me 4
1 is in that set
3 is in that set
but 4 definitely is not
is definitely not in that set
let's have a look at a set a
and my set a
is just going to be the set 0
1 2 3 and 4
and I say is that set
closed under addition
2 plus 3
equals 5
and that is not an element of a
is it closed under multiplication
no it's not closed under multiplication
because 2 times 3
equals 6
and that is definitely not an element of a
so you see where these binary operations
where these binary operations are going
I think in the next example
I'm going to show you quite an abstract
set
and the operations
on that set
and you'll get an even deeper understanding
of this very intuitive way
of looking at it
so operations
first bit of excitement as far as I'm concerned
in abstract algebra
