Let us work on some examples. We asked to find the area bounded by the x-axis and the function y equals 6 minus x minus x squared.
It is a simple definite integration problem made slightly more complicated because we have to work out the intervals ourselves.
What would those intervals be? Well they'd be at the x-intercepts and the x-intercepts are when y equals 0.
We'll thus have 6 minus x minus x squared equals 0.
If I rewrite that and just multiply negative 1 throughout I'll get x squared plus x minus 6 equals 0.
If I factor that out it seems I'll get x plus 3 and x minus 2 which is 0.
In other words we'll get x equals negative 3 all the way up to x equals 2.
That will be our interval.
So what are we asked? We asked the definite integral in going from negative 3 to 2 of 6 minus x minus x squared with respect to x.
First of all on the side I'll just note that 6 is actually 6x to the power 0.
How do we take the antiderivative of that?
Well we're going to add 1 to the power and divide the coefficient by that new power.
So that will be 6 divided by 1 x to the power 1.
So just a little reminder.
So here we go.
We have 6x as our first term minus x to the power 1.
1 plus 1 is 2.
Let's put the negative out.
That will be 1 divided by the new power which is 2.
x to that new power 2.
Put the minus out again.
2.
The power is 2.
2 plus 1 is 3.
So the coefficient of x squared is 1.
That will be 1 over 3.
x to the power 3.
And this is a definite integral.
So we don't put a plus c.
We're going from negative 3 to 2.
From the fundamental theorem of calculus we know we can just substitute these values.
That will be the, in actual fact, the F.
Remember that will be capital F of B minus the F of A.
Let's go.
So we're going to have 6 times 2.
We're going to have a half 2 squared.
Then we're going to have negative 1 third.
We're going to have 2 cubed.
From that we're going to subtract 6 and we're going to substitute negative 3.
I think I'm going to run out of space.
I'll just carry on.
You'll know what I'm doing even though it goes off screen.
Negative 1 half.
It's minus 3 squared.
Negative 1 third.
It's minus 3.
There we go.
Off the screen.
Cubed.
So that will be 12.
Minus.
2 times 2 is 4.
Divided by 2 is 2.
2 to the power of 3 is 8.
So that will be negative 8 over 3.
6 times negative 3 is negative 18.
So that will be a plus 18.
Negative 3 squared is 9.
So that will be negative 9.
That will be positive 9 over 2.
Negative 3 cubed is negative 27.
Negative 27 times negative 1 third is plus 9.
So we're going to have a 10.
Is that negative 9?
Let's see.
It's negative times negative.
But we are multiplying with a positive out front.
So that is going to be a negative.
So 12 minus 2 is 10.
Plus 18 is 28.
Minus 9 is 19.
Minus 8 over 3.
Plus 9 over 2.
Looks like our common denominator is going to be a 6.
Now let's see.
What is 19 times 6?
45.
45.
1, 1, 4.
So that is going to be 1, 1, 4.
3 goes into 6 2 times.
So that will be minus 16.
So take away 16 from that.
Take away 16 from that.
And you're left with 98.
And is that correct?
To that we're going to add 3.
To that we're going to add 27.
If we add 27 to that we're going to get 125.
125 over 6 will be our final answer.
And just check the arithmetic of that.
So I'm pretty sure that's correct.
So I'm pretty sure that's correct.
So I'm pretty sure that's correct.
