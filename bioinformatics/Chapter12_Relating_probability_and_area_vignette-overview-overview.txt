The text describes a video that connects p-values to geometric concepts by comparing them to areas within circles, triangles, and squares. While standard geometry relies on well-known equations for calculating these areas, interpreting p-values involves more complex statistical mathematics. In practice, one would draw a graph where specific regions under the curve represent the p-value, illustrating how statistics can be visualized through geometry.
