So good, let's talk about equivalence relations. I'm going to throw quite a few definitions at you in this little section.
So let's just talk about equivalence relations.
Equivalence. Equivalence.
Relations.
Now, we've looked at binary relations and we've looked at its properties.
Now, if it has all three of those properties, if it is reflexive,
if it is reflexive, if it is symmetric, and it is transitive.
If it has all of those three properties, we call it an equivalence relation.
And there's something very special about equivalence relations, and I'll show you what that is.
Before we do that, though, let's just get another definition.
Let's have a look at something like parity.
I just want to do that as an example.
Let's look at parity.
So if we just look at the set of integers,
integers, the elements of the integers,
so elements of the integers,
of the integers,
have parity,
parity,
if they are either even,
if they are either even or odd.
So, two, four, six, they're all even,
so they have parity.
One, three, five, they're all odd,
so they will have parity.
So let's look at this,
let's look at this relation.
If we have,
if we have our relation has the same parity,
let's do that.
Our relation is,
has
same
parity.
That is our,
that is our,
and we just look at the set of all,
our set that we are looking at
as the set of all integers minus zero.
So we're just taking all the integers,
except for zero.
So,
negative one,
negative two,
and one,
two,
three,
all of those.
And we just look at,
has the same parity.
So what are we going to be left with?
Well,
we're going to be left actually with two subsets,
aren't we?
Our first subset that we're going to have,
subset one,
is going to be the set of all elements.
Well,
let's call them,
what did I call them in my example?
I call them n,
such that n is an,
well,
let's just say,
n is an element of the,
of the integers,
minus zero,
and n is even.
And n is even,
that will be my first subset,
and my second subset is going to be the set of all,
n,
such that n is an element of the integers,
minus zero,
and n is odd.
Now look at those two.
If my set that I started off with,
is the set of,
of integers,
minus zero,
if that is the set that I'm looking at,
look what happens here,
if I,
if I make the union,
of these two sets.
Well,
that is going to equal,
my set,
that I started with,
and if I look at my intersection,
of these two,
a sub one,
and a sub two,
that is going to be the empty set.
That is going to be the empty set.
And let's have a look at it.
Is this thing reflexive?
This relation of mine,
is it reflexive?
So,
for any element,
say in this first one,
in this first subset that I've created,
I can have 2,
2,
and 3,
and 3,
for any element that I choose in this one,
I can write this.
So definitely,
it is that.
And if I look,
is it symmetric?
Well,
if 2 and 4,
is an element of that,
4 and 2,
is definitely an element of that.
So it definitely is symmetric.
Is it transitive?
If 2 and 4 is in it,
and,
and let's make it,
4 and 6 are in there,
4 and 6 are in there,
and then most definitely,
2 and 6 are also in there,
and indeed,
2 and 6 would also be in there.
So this is an equivalence.
This is an equivalence relation,
and the nice thing about,
an equivalence relation,
is it creates a partitioning,
a partitioning of my set,
that I started off with.
And we know it's a partitioning,
if,
take the union of all,
it needn't only be 2,
if I take the union,
of all of these subsets,
that I create,
through this equivalence relation,
I get back to the original set,
and if I take,
the intersection of any 2,
any 2 partitions,
I might have a thousand,
thousand,
any 2 of them,
their intersection,
will be empty.
So,
the union of all of them,
will be the original set,
any pair of them,
if I take the intersection,
of any pair,
that will be an empty set.
So,
that is an equivalence relation,
that has,
an equivalence relation,
is a symmetric,
we're just dealing with symmetric now,
a symmetric relation,
that has all three,
of these properties,
with this unique,
unique little trick to it,
that it has,
partitions,
at least,
my original set.
