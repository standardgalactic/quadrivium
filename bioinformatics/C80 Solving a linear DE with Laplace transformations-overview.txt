The text explains how to solve an initial value problem using Laplace transforms. The differential equation is \( y' = 3y + 13 \sin(2t) \), with an initial condition \( y(0) = 6 \). The solution involves taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation, applying linearity and known transform properties.

1. **Laplace Transform Application:**
   - The left-hand side transforms to \( sY(s) - y(0) + 3Y(s) \).
   - The right-hand side becomes \( 13 \cdot \frac{2}{s^2 + 4} \).

2. **Substitution and Simplification:**
   - Substitute \( y(0) = 6 \) into the equation, resulting in:
     \[
     (s + 3)Y(s) - 6 = \frac{26}{s^2 + 4}
     \]
   - Solve for \( Y(s) \):
     \[
     Y(s) = \frac{26}{(s^2 + 4)(s + 3)} + \frac{6}{s + 3}
     \]

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**
   - Express \( Y(s) \) in partial fractions:
     \[
     Y(s) = \frac{8}{s + 3} - \frac{2s}{s^2 + 4}
     \]

4. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**
   - Apply the inverse Laplace transform to each term using linearity:
     - \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{8}{s + 3}\right\} = 8e^{-3t} \)
     - \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{-\frac{2s}{s^2 + 4}\right\} = -2\cos(2t) \)

5. **Final Solution:**
   - Combine the results to obtain the solution in the time domain:
     \[
     y(t) = 8e^{-3t} - 2\cos(2t)
     \]

The process demonstrates how Laplace transforms convert a differential equation into an algebraic problem, simplifying the solution process.

The text is a detailed explanation of solving a differential equation using Laplace transforms. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to solve a differential equation by converting it into an algebraic equation using the Laplace transform.

2. **Process**:
   - Apply the inverse Laplace transform to each term individually.
   - Start with recognizing that taking the inverse Laplace of the Laplace transform of \( f(t) \) returns \( f(t) \).
   - Solve for constants in the transformed equation: \( a = -3 \), which gives \( e^{-3t} \).
   - For terms involving \( s \) over \( s^2 + k^2 \), identify them as cosine functions, resulting in \( \cos(2t) \).
   - For terms with \( k \) over \( s^2 + k^2 \), recognize them as sine functions, leading to \( 3\sin(2t) \).

3. **Outcome**: The differential equation is successfully transformed into a simpler algebraic form using initial conditions and partial fractions, allowing the inverse Laplace transform to provide the solution.

4. **Conclusion**: The process demonstrates the power of Laplace transforms in simplifying and solving differential equations, with the final solution expressed as \( 8e^{-3t} - \cos(2t) + 3\sin(2t) \).

The text explains how to solve an initial value problem using Laplace transforms. The differential equation is \( Y' = 3y + 13\sin(2t) \), with the initial condition \( y(0) = 6 \). Here's a summary of the solution process:

1. **Apply Laplace Transform**: 
   - Use linearity and properties of Laplace transforms to convert the differential equation into an algebraic equation.
   - The transform of \( Y' \) is \( sY(s) - y(0) \).
   - Therefore, the transformed equation becomes:  
     \[
     sY(s) - 6 + 3Y(s) = \frac{13 \times 2}{s^2 + 4}
     \]

2. **Solve for \( Y(s) \)**:
   - Rearrange and solve for \( Y(s) \):  
     \[
     (s + 3)Y(s) = \frac{26}{s^2 + 4} + 6
     \]
   - Simplify to find:  
     \[
     Y(s) = \frac{26 + 6s^2 + 24}{(s + 3)(s^2 + 4)}
     \]

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**:
   - Express \( Y(s) \) in terms of partial fractions to make it easier to invert back to the time domain.

4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:
   - Apply inverse Laplace transform using linearity and known transforms.
   - The solution involves finding constants for partial fractions and then transforming each term back to the time domain.

5. **Result**:
   - The process converts a differential equation into an algebraic problem, which is easier to solve, demonstrating the utility of Laplace transforms in simplifying such problems.

This method effectively turns a complex differential equation into manageable algebraic steps, illustrating the power of Laplace transforms in solving initial value problems.

The text discusses solving a differential equation using Laplace transforms. The process involves transforming the original equation into an algebraic one with initial conditions applied. It uses partial fraction decomposition to simplify the transformed function and then applies the inverse Laplace transform to revert back to the time domain. This results in a solution involving exponential, cosine, and sine functions: \( e^{-3t} \), \(\cos(2t)\), and \( \sin(2t) \). The author expresses satisfaction with using these techniques to arrive at the final answer.
