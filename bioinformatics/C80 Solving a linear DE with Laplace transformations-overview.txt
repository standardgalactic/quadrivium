The text explains how to solve an initial value problem using Laplace transforms. The differential equation is \( y' = 3y + 13 \sin(2t) \), with an initial condition \( y(0) = 6 \). The solution involves taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation, applying linearity and known transform properties.

1. **Laplace Transform Application:**
   - The left-hand side transforms to \( sY(s) - y(0) + 3Y(s) \).
   - The right-hand side becomes \( 13 \cdot \frac{2}{s^2 + 4} \).

2. **Substitution and Simplification:**
   - Substitute \( y(0) = 6 \) into the equation, resulting in:
     \[
     (s + 3)Y(s) - 6 = \frac{26}{s^2 + 4}
     \]
   - Solve for \( Y(s) \):
     \[
     Y(s) = \frac{26}{(s^2 + 4)(s + 3)} + \frac{6}{s + 3}
     \]

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**
   - Express \( Y(s) \) in partial fractions:
     \[
     Y(s) = \frac{8}{s + 3} - \frac{2s}{s^2 + 4}
     \]

4. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**
   - Apply the inverse Laplace transform to each term using linearity:
     - \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{8}{s + 3}\right\} = 8e^{-3t} \)
     - \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{-\frac{2s}{s^2 + 4}\right\} = -2\cos(2t) \)

5. **Final Solution:**
   - Combine the results to obtain the solution in the time domain:
     \[
     y(t) = 8e^{-3t} - 2\cos(2t)
     \]

The process demonstrates how Laplace transforms convert a differential equation into an algebraic problem, simplifying the solution process.

The text is a detailed explanation of solving a differential equation using Laplace transforms. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to solve a differential equation by converting it into an algebraic equation using the Laplace transform.

2. **Process**:
   - Apply the inverse Laplace transform to each term individually.
   - Start with recognizing that taking the inverse Laplace of the Laplace transform of \( f(t) \) returns \( f(t) \).
   - Solve for constants in the transformed equation: \( a = -3 \), which gives \( e^{-3t} \).
   - For terms involving \( s \) over \( s^2 + k^2 \), identify them as cosine functions, resulting in \( \cos(2t) \).
   - For terms with \( k \) over \( s^2 + k^2 \), recognize them as sine functions, leading to \( 3\sin(2t) \).

3. **Outcome**: The differential equation is successfully transformed into a simpler algebraic form using initial conditions and partial fractions, allowing the inverse Laplace transform to provide the solution.

4. **Conclusion**: The process demonstrates the power of Laplace transforms in simplifying and solving differential equations, with the final solution expressed as \( 8e^{-3t} - \cos(2t) + 3\sin(2t) \).
