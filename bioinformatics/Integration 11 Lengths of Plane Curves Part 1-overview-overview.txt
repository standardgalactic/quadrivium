The text explains how to approximate the length of a curve given by parametric equations \( x = f(t) \) and \( y = g(t) \), where both functions are continuously differentiable. To find the curve's length over an interval, you divide it into small segments between consecutive points.

For each segment, the distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:

\[ l_k = \sqrt{(\Delta x_k)^2 + (\Delta y_k)^2} \]

Here, \( \Delta x_k = f(t_k) - f(t_{k-1}) \) and \( \Delta y_k = g(t_k) - g(t_{k-1}) \). Using the mean value theorem, these differences are expressed in terms of derivatives:

\[ \Delta x_k = f'(t_k) \cdot \Delta t_k \]
\[ \Delta y_k = g'(t_k) \cdot \Delta t_k \]

As the interval \( \Delta t \) becomes smaller, each segment length \( l_k \) approximates the arc length between points. The total curve length from \( a \) to \( b \) is the sum of these small segments:

\[ L = \int_a^b \sqrt{(f'(t))^2 + (g'(t))^2} \, dt \]

This calculation assumes the path is traversed once without retracing as \( t \) increases.
