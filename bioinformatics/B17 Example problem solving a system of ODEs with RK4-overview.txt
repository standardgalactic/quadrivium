The text describes using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve a system of first-order differential equations. Specifically, it focuses on solving two coupled equations: \( x' = 2x - y \) and \( y' = x \). The initial conditions are set as \( x(0) = 1 \) and \( y(0) = 5 \), with a step size of 0.05.

The process involves calculating intermediate values (m1, m2, m3, m4 for the function f related to \( x' \) and k1, k2, k3, k4 for the function g related to \( y' \)) using Runge-Kutta formulas. These calculations require evaluating functions at different points within each step interval.

The text mentions setting up a Python script using Matplotlib for visualization. The script plots both x(t) and y(t) as functions of time t, with x(t) represented by red squares and y(t) by green triangles. This allows for the visual comparison of how x and y evolve over the defined interval from \( t = 0 \) to \( t < 1 \). The final output is a graph displaying these two trajectories, making it easier to analyze their behavior.

The text describes an example of solving a system of first-order differential equations using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The focus is on finding the functions \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\), where:

- \( x' = 2x - y \)
- \( y' = x \)

These initial conditions are set as \(x(0) = 1\) and \(y(0) = 5\).

The method involves calculating intermediate values using a step size of 0.05, iterating from \(t = 0\) to \(t < 1\). The process includes:

1. Computing four slopes (m1, m2, m3, m4 for x and k1, k2, k3, k4 for y) at each time step.
2. Using weighted averages of these slopes to update the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

The code snippet provided imports `matplotlib` to plot the functions \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\). The results are plotted on a graph with red squares representing \(x(t)\) and green triangles for \(y(t)\), demonstrating their behavior over time.

This approach allows visualization of how both variables evolve within the specified range, providing insight into the dynamics described by the differential equations.
