The text describes using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve a system of first-order differential equations. Specifically, it focuses on solving two coupled equations: \( x' = 2x - y \) and \( y' = x \). The initial conditions are set as \( x(0) = 1 \) and \( y(0) = 5 \), with a step size of 0.05.

The process involves calculating intermediate values (m1, m2, m3, m4 for the function f related to \( x' \) and k1, k2, k3, k4 for the function g related to \( y' \)) using Runge-Kutta formulas. These calculations require evaluating functions at different points within each step interval.

The text mentions setting up a Python script using Matplotlib for visualization. The script plots both x(t) and y(t) as functions of time t, with x(t) represented by red squares and y(t) by green triangles. This allows for the visual comparison of how x and y evolve over the defined interval from \( t = 0 \) to \( t < 1 \). The final output is a graph displaying these two trajectories, making it easier to analyze their behavior.
