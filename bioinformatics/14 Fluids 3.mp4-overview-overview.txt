Pascal's Principle asserts that pressure applied to an incompressible fluid within a closed system is equally distributed throughout the fluid. This principle is fundamental for hydraulic lifts, where applying force over a small area (input) creates uniform pressure across the fluid, resulting in a larger output force on a bigger area, allowing heavy objects to be lifted with less input force.

Key points of Pascal's Principle include:

1. **Pressure Transmission**: Pressure applied at any point in an incompressible fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid, following the formula \( P = \text{Force/ Area} \).

2. **Force Amplification**: A small input force over a small area can produce a larger output force over a bigger area, enabling significant lifting capabilities.

3. **Volume Conservation**: The volume of fluid displaced by applying pressure on one side must equal the volume displaced on the opposite side (\( \text{Area} \times \text{Distance} \)).

4. **Work Equivalence**: Work input equals work output (\( \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \)), meaning that while the output force is greater, it moves a shorter distance compared to the input side.

These principles enable engineers to design efficient systems where small forces can lift large weights by utilizing pressure and fluid mechanics in hydraulic applications.
