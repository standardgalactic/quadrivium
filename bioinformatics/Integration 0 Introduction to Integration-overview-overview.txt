The text introduces integration as a fundamental concept in calculus that complements differentiation by focusing on calculating areas under curves rather than finding instantaneous rates of change. While differentiation deals with slopes and changes, integration involves summing smaller contributions to determine the area beneath a graph. 

The mathematical core of integration is about finding these areas, starting from simpler geometric shapes like circles and rectangles, whose areas are well-known, to more complex ones such as an irregular shape bounded by the y-axis, x-axis, and the curve \(y = 1 - x^2\) in the first Cartesian quadrant.

To approach this problem, the text emphasizes building on concepts of addition and sigma notation, similar to those used in differentiation, with limits playing a crucial role. The goal is to compute the area under the given curve using integration, setting up foundational knowledge for deeper exploration in future discussions or educational materials.
