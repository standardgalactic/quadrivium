The text integrates concepts from mathematics and physics to enhance understanding of classical mechanics through differentiation. It explains that differentiation calculates slopes (division), while integration deals with areas (multiplication). Differentiation is used to find velocity by determining the slope of a distance-time curve.

Using \( y = x^2 \) as an example, it illustrates calculating average velocity between two points as the slope of the line connecting them. For instantaneous velocity at a specific moment, limits are introduced to resolve indeterminate forms (0/0). The derivative, found by applying the limit as \( h \) approaches zero, gives the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve, representing instantaneous velocity.

For the function \( f(x) = x^2 \), the derivative is \( 2x \), indicating the slope of the tangent. At one second, a vehicle travels at 2 meters per second, corresponding to the first derivative of \( f(x) = x^2 \). Differentiation thus provides an instantaneous rate of change on a Cartesian plane, transforming a distance equation into a velocity equation by considering the limit as the interval (\( \Delta x \) or \( h \)) becomes infinitesimally small.
