The text introduces advanced calculus concepts focusing on vector and multivariable functions, building upon single-variable calculus foundations. It begins with the explanation that vector functions describe a particle's path over time using position vectors dependent on \( t \), expressed as \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \). Notation for these vector functions is often denoted as \( \mathbf{R}(t) \).

The text delves into derivatives of vector functions, stating that if a vector function is continuous at a point or over its domain, it can be differentiated. The derivative notation includes forms like \( \mathbf{R}'(t) \) and \( \frac{d\mathbf{R}}{dt} \), using limits akin to those in single-variable calculus.

The differentiation process for vector functions employs familiar techniques such as the product rule and chain rule:

1. **Product Rule**: Differentiation of each component separately is demonstrated, with an example involving trigonometric functions showing that if a function is \( u(t) \cdot v(t) \), its derivative is \( u'(t)v(t) + u(t)v'(t) \).

2. **Chain Rule**: For vector functions like \( R(S(t)) \), where \( S \) is a function of \( t \), the chain rule states that the derivative is \( R'(S(t)) \cdot S'(t) \). This involves differentiating each component with respect to its inner function, substituting back in the expression for the inner function, and multiplying by the derivative of the inner function.

The text provides an example to apply these rules and includes a verification step for correctness. It also touches briefly on parametrizing functions in two dimensions as part of vector calculus applications.

A specific case discussed involves using a vector function to describe a particle's path with \( x = t \) and \( y(t) = 3t^2 + \frac{2}{t} \), giving the parametric form \( r(t) = (t, 3t^2 + \frac{2}{t}) \). The derivative \( r'(t) \) is interpreted as velocity:

- \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 1 \)
- \( \frac{dy}{dt} = 6t - \frac{2}{t^2} \)

To find the speed, which represents the magnitude of velocity, one calculates the norm of this derivative vector by squaring each component, summing them, and taking the square root:

\[ \text{Speed} = \sqrt{1^2 + (6t - \frac{2}{t^2})^2} \]

This calculation translates the instantaneous rate of change from velocity to speed.
