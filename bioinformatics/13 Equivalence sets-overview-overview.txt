The text explains how equivalence relations partition a set into disjoint subsets known as equivalence classes. These are defined using square brackets to include all elements \( Y \) of a larger set \( A \) that satisfy a specific relation with a given element \( A \). The three key properties of an equivalence relation—reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity—are crucial for proving statements about these sets.

The text outlines two main points for proof:
1. An element \( A \) is always in its own equivalence class.
2. If another element \( B \) belongs to the equivalence class of \( A \), then their classes are identical, containing no additional elements beyond those in \( A \)'s class.

To prove these, it uses the transitive property to show that if \( B \) is related to \( A \) and any element \( x \) is related to \( B \), then \( x \) must also relate to \( A \). This ensures all members of \( B \)'s class are in \( A \)'s class, establishing their identity. Symmetry helps demonstrate bidirectional inclusion.

The text also suggests a more complex proof: the intersection of two different equivalence classes is empty if they are distinct. This confirms that equivalence classes partition the set without overlap, with each element belonging to exactly one class. It encourages further exploration in textbooks for deeper understanding and proof of these properties.
