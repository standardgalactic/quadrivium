We continue our look into hernias and in this video we'll start off with by
looking at the various hernias and then go into some of them in more depth. So
here's a list that is not complete but these are the ones that we're going to
discuss or certainly what we're going to discuss. Well we have ventral or
epigastric hernias and in these we also include the umbilical hernias and also
then the incisional hernias anything that is in the anterior abdominal wall
most notably the midline. Then there are the groin hernias we're talking inguinal
and femoral hernias and then these spegelian hernias we've had a
quick mention of them on the lateral edges of the rectus muscle. We'll look at
lumbar hernias the two triangles at the back. We'll look at the
different pelvic floor hernias of which the obturator hernia is one.
We'll look at internal hernias. Now these can be in normal spaces and
openings inside the abdominal cavity but also
false spaces that are formed by adhesions due to previous surgeries or
infections. A richter hernia with a full abdominal a full
wall of a bowel is not included in the hernia but only a part of the wall.
A literary hernia well those would be ones that contain a mechal diverticulum
and also then lastly the differential diagnosis of a
lump that appears as a hernia.
