Now that we know how to determine the area between two curves on an interval, let's look at this example.
It's going to be fairly long. We are asked to find the area enclosed by y equals 4 minus x squared and y equals minus 3x.
First of all, we need to determine the interval of this problem, this integration problem.
And that's going to be where these two lines, one would be a parabola and the other one a line where they intersect.
And they're going to intersect where they are equal to each other.
In other words, we're going to say 4 minus x squared equals negative 3x.
If we get everything on one side, that would be minus x squared plus 3x plus 4 equals 0.
And multiplying negative 1 out throughout would leave us with x squared minus 3x minus 4 equals 0.
Let's get the roots of that.
That looks like it will be x minus 4 and x plus 1.
And that is going to leave us with our interval of x equals negative 1 to x equals 4.
So we know our interval.
Now we need to determine what the f of x minus the g of x is going to be.
Let us call this the f of x and we'll call this the g of x.
So the f of x minus the g of x equals 4 minus x squared minus negative 3x.
If we simplify that, we'll get 4 negative x squared positive 3x.
And that is what we're going to use in our integration.
So if we want to find the area between two graphs on an interval,
our formula for that or our equation for that would be,
remember, let's just write it down going from the definite integral going from a to b of the f of x minus the g of x with respect to x.
If we substitute our value now, we're going to get the indefinite integral and going from negative 1 to 4 of 4 minus x squared plus 3x with respect to x.
Remember, let's just move up.
Give ourselves some more space.
So we have a function here and from the fundamental theorem of calculus,
we know we can get the anti-derivative of this.
And we can substitute the top value and subtract from that, substituting the bottom value.
So let's get the integral of that.
That is going to be, remember, 4 would be 4x to the power 0.
If we, that 4, if we add 1 to the 0 to the power, that is 1,
and we divide the coefficient by our new power, so we get 4x.
Minus x squared, that will be a third x to the power 3.
And plus 3 over 2x squared, and we're going on an interval from negative 1 to 4.
Let's just work out on the side.
Let's just look at that.
3x, that would be to the power 1.
We're going to add 1 to that power, so 1 plus 1 is 2.
And we're going to divide the coefficient, which was 3, by our new power, which is 2.
Let's substitute.
And this is where the mistakes usually come, with simple arithmetic.
So we're going to have 4, substitute the 4, minus a third, substitute the 4, cubed,
plus 3 over 2, substitute the 4, squared, and we're going to subtract from that.
4, substitute the negative 1, minus a third, substitute the negative 1, cubed, plus 3 over 2, substitute the negative 1, squared.
That is going to leave us with 16, minus, what is 4 to the power 3, that's 64, 64 over 3, plus 4 squared is 16.
16, 16 times 3 is 48, over 2, negative 1, squared, is 48, over 2, negative 1, squared, is 1, so that's positive 3 over 2.
So that is going to be 16, minus 64 over 3, plus 24, plus 4, negative 1, third, negative 3 over 2.
So, it looks like our common denominator is going to be 6.
Let me try and draw a neat line here.
So that will be a 6.
So, this will change what is 16 times 6.
That's 96, take away 64.
Plus, that'll be 144, plus, that'll be 24, that'll be minus 2, that'll be minus 9.
If we do that simple sum on our calculator, we get 125 over 6.
