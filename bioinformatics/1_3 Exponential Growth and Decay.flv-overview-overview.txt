The text outlines a model for population growth transitioning from exponential to logistic models using differential equations. Initially, it discusses exponential growth where the rate of change in population is proportional to its current size, assuming unlimited resources. However, this idealistic scenario is modified by introducing a logistic growth model to account for resource limitations and competition.

In the logistic model, the equation is:

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = ky(m - y) \]

where \( k \) is a proportionality constant and \( m \) is the carrying capacity. The model identifies two equilibrium solutions: when the population is zero or at its maximum capacity, growth ceases.

To solve this differential equation, it is treated as separable:

\[ \int \frac{1}{y(m - y)} \, dy = \int k \, dt \]

Using partial fraction decomposition:

\[ \frac{1}{y(m-y)} = \frac{a}{y} + \frac{b}{m-y} \]

the equation is integrated to yield expressions involving natural logarithms. These are then used to derive the population over time, showing how it asymptotically approaches the carrying capacity \( m \).

The solution process involves:
1. **Integration**: Resulting in logarithmic terms.
2. **Simplification**: Leading to an equation with constants.
3. **Exponentiation**: To eliminate logarithms.
4. **Rearranging**: To solve for population size \( y \).
5. **Final Solution**: Giving the logistic growth formula:

\[ y = \frac{ame^{kmt}}{1 + ae^{kmt}} \]

This solution captures the realistic dynamics of populations under resource constraints, contrasting with the exponential model's idealized assumptions.
