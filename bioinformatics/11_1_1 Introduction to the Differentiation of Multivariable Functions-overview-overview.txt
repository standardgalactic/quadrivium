The provided text offers an introduction to multivariable functions and their differentiation using partial derivatives, contrasting them with vector functions from single-variable calculus.

### Key Points:

1. **Definition**: 
   - A multivariable function has multiple input variables that map to a single output, e.g., \( f(x, y) = 3x^2 + xy + y^2 \).
   - It can be extended into three dimensions by adding another variable, forming surfaces or spaces.

2. **Partial Derivatives**:
   - To differentiate these functions with respect to one variable at a time, partial derivatives are used.
   - Other variables are treated as constants during differentiation.
   - Notation includes \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) for the derivative with respect to \(x\) and similar forms for other variables.

3. **Notations**:
   - Various notations exist, such as subscript indices or alternative symbols like \(\nabla f\) for the gradient vector.
   - The gradient vector comprises all partial derivatives, indicating how the function changes in each input direction.

4. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - In three dimensions, the gradient vector describes the slope of tangent planes to surfaces.
   - This concept extends to higher dimensions with hyperplanes.

5. **First Principles**:
   - The text also touches on calculating derivatives using first principles (limits), though this approach is complex and often avoided for practical calculations.

### Example Calculations:

- For a function like \( f(x, y, z) = x^2y + z \):
  - Standard differentiation gives the partial derivative with respect to \( x \) as \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy \).
  - Using first principles:
    \[
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h)^2y + z - (x^2y + z)}{h}
    \]
  - Simplifies to \( 2xy \) after canceling terms and dividing by \( h \).

### Conclusion:

The text emphasizes understanding partial derivatives in multivariable calculus through both standard differentiation rules and foundational limit principles. This dual approach helps solidify comprehension of how functions change across multiple dimensions, which is crucial for exploring complex mathematical landscapes beyond single-variable calculus. The mention of "Aladdin" appears unrelated to the mathematical content and may be an error or placeholder.
