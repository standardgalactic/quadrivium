The text provides a detailed explanation of how sound intensity and pressure amplitude change with variations in decibels.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Sound Level (Decibels) Calculation**:
   - Sound level is expressed in decibels (dB), calculated as \( 10 \times \log_{10}(\text{Intensity}/\text{Reference Intensity}) \).
   - A change of 30 dB represents a factor increase of 1,000 in intensity.

2. **Pressure Amplitude Change**:
   - The relationship between sound intensity (\( I \)) and pressure amplitude (\( P \)) is given by \( I = \frac{1}{2} \rho v \omega^2 A^2 \), where \( A \) is the amplitude.
   - Increasing intensity by a factor of 1,000 increases pressure amplitude by a factor of approximately 31.6.

3. **Example Problem**:
   - For a sound reduced from 70 dB to 50 dB at a frequency of 500 Hz:
     - Initial Intensity (\( I_{\text{initial}} \)): \( 10^{-5} \) watts per square meter (or 10 µW/m²).
     - Final Intensity (\( I_{\text{final}} \)): \( 10^{-7} \) watts per square meter (or 0.1 µW/m²).
     - The intensity decreases by a factor of 100.

4. **Amplitude Calculation**:
   - Using the formula \( A = \sqrt{\frac{I}{2\pi^2 f^2 \rho v}} \):
     - Initial amplitude (\( A_{70} \)): Approximately 17 nanometers.
     - Final amplitude (\( A_{50} \)) can be calculated similarly by substituting the final intensity.

The text illustrates how decibel changes translate into physical changes in sound properties, providing both theoretical explanations and practical calculations.

The text describes calculations related to sound intensity and power intercepted by a microphone from a point sound source emitting isotropically. Here's a summary:

1. **Proportionality**: The intensity \( I \) is directly proportional to the square of the sound amplitude (\( SM^2 \)). When the amplitude changes, the intensity changes proportionally.

2. **Intensity Calculation**:
   - A point sound source emits 30 watts isotropically.
   - To find the intensity at a distance (200 meters), use the formula \( I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2} \).
   - Substituting the values, the intensity is calculated to be approximately 59.7 microwatts per square meter.

3. **Power Intercepted by Microphone**:
   - A microphone with an area of 0.750 square centimeters (or 0.000075 square meters) intercepts sound at this distance.
   - The power intercepted is found using \( \text{Power} = I \times \text{Area} \).
   - This results in approximately 4.48 nanowatts.

The calculations demonstrate how to determine both the intensity of sound at a certain distance and the power intercepted by a small area, ensuring all units are converted to SI for consistency.
