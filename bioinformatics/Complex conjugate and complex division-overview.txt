Great explanation! Let's summarize and clarify the process of dividing two complex numbers, as you've demonstrated with your example.

### Steps for Dividing Complex Numbers

1. **Identify the Complex Numbers**: Suppose we want to divide \( z_1 = a + bi \) by \( z_2 = c + di \).

2. **Multiply by the Conjugate of the Denominator**:
   - Find the conjugate of the denominator: \( \overline{z_2} = c - di \).
   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by this conjugate.

3. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - The expression becomes:
     \[
     \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}
     \]
   - The denominator simplifies to a real number: \( c^2 + d^2 \) because:
     \[
     (c + di)(c - di) = c^2 - (di)^2 = c^2 + d^2
     \]

4. **Expand the Numerator**:
   - Use distributive property to expand:
     \[
     (a + bi)(c - di) = ac - adi + bci - bdi^2
     \]
   - Simplify using \( i^2 = -1 \):
     \[
     = ac + bd + (bc - ad)i
     \]

5. **Combine and Divide**:
   - The expression is now:
     \[
     \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}
     \]
   - Separate into real and imaginary parts:
     \[
     = \frac{ac + bd}{c^2 + d^2} + \frac{bc - ad}{c^2 + d^2}i
     \]

### Example with Your Numbers

- **Given**: \( z_1 = 3 + 4i \) and \( z_2 = 1 + i \).
- **Conjugate of \( z_2 \)**: \( \overline{z_2} = 1 - i \).

**Calculation**:

\[
\frac{(3 + 4i)(1 - i)}{(1 + i)(1 - i)}
\]

- **Denominator**: 
  \[
  (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2
  \]

- **Numerator**:
  \[
  (3 + 4i)(1 - i) = 3 - 3i + 4i - 4i^2 = 3 + 4 + (4 - 3)i = 7 + i
  \]

- **Final Result**:
  \[
  \frac{7}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i
  \]

This process confirms your example and shows how dividing complex numbers is simplified by using the conjugate of the denominator. Well done! ðŸ˜Š
