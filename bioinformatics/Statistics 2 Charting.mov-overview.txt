The video provides an overview of various methods to graphically represent data, emphasizing that such representations help highlight information that might not be apparent from numerical tables alone. The discussion covers several types of charts:

1. **Histograms**: These require understanding frequency distribution. A list of patients with penetrating trauma per month over two years is used as an example. The creation involves dividing the data into equal-sized classes (e.g., 50-54, 55-59) and plotting the number of months in each class to form a bar chart.

2. **Relative Frequency Distribution**: This is similar to frequency distribution but expresses counts as percentages relative to the total period (24 months in this case), ensuring the sum approximates 100%.

3. **Pie Charts**: They use relative frequencies to complete a circle, where slices represent different classes' proportions.

4. **Stem and Leaf Charts**: These display data akin to histograms but retain numerical values. The tens digit forms the "stem," while ones form the "leaves."

5. **Line Charts**: A common chart type that plots two sets of values on a Cartesian plane, connecting points with lines.

The video concludes by mentioning upcoming discussions on statistical measures like mean, median, and mode in future videos.
