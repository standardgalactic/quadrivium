The text explores the concept of node degrees within graph theory, emphasizing regular graphs where each vertex has an equal number of incident edges. In complete graphs—a type of regular graph—every pair of distinct vertices is linked by a unique edge, resulting in all nodes having the same degree. The degree of a vertex is defined as the count of its connecting edges, with loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) contributing two to this count.

The text introduces Mathematica for exploring graph properties, using it to create and analyze a complete graph with 10 nodes. It calculates that each node has a degree of 9 and verifies that the total sum of all degrees is 90, consistent with the handshaking lemma: the sum of vertex degrees equals twice the number of edges.

Additionally, regular graphs are discussed in detail:
1. A **degree one regular graph** consists of nodes connected such that each node has only one edge. An example given includes four nodes (1, 2, 3, 4), each with a single connecting edge.
   
2. In a **degree two regular graph using loops**, nodes are interconnected by loops or mutual edges so that each vertex achieves a degree of two. For instance:
   - Node 1 has a loop contributing to its degree of 2.
   - Nodes 2 and 3 are paired with edges, ensuring each maintains a degree of 2.

These examples illustrate the uniformity in vertex degrees characteristic of regular graphs and exemplify the application of the handshaking lemma. This principle asserts that for any undirected graph, the sum of all vertices' degrees is twice the total number of edges.
