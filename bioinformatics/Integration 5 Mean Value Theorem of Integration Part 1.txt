Let us consider the mean value theorem of integration.
It is very similar to the mean value theorem of differentiation.
Look at these two graphs.
On the left it represents the curve y equals the f of x on an interval from a to b.
The area under the curve is shaded blue and is calculated by the definite integral from a to b of the f of x with respect to x.
Thinking back to Riemann sums we dealt with an infinite number of rectangles.
They each had a base width and a height.
Along the interval from a to b the curve will reach various heights or y values.
Various y values are shown in the graph.
Looking at all the y values as we move on the x axis from a to b there must be an average y value.
We say that a continuous curve has an average value on a closed interval.
That average value will be reached at some x value at or between a and b.
In other words it will be the f of c.
This is easily defined by an equation.
It is the definite integral divided by the length of the a to b interval.
In other words the definite integral divided by b minus a.
Geometrically the mean value theorem of integration states that there is a number c in the closed interval from a to b such that the area of a rectangle with the same base width as the interval b minus a and the height at x equals c or the f of c will be the same as the area under the curve of the function on that interval.
That is the mean value theorem of integration.
That is the mean value theorem of integration.
