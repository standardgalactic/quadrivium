The text presents a problem of determining whether two lines in three-dimensional space intersect and, if so, finding the point of intersection. The lines are given in parametric form:

1. Line 1: \( x = 3 + 4t \), \( y = 4 + t \), \( z = 1 \)
2. Line 2: \( x = -1 + 12s \), \( y = 7 + 6s \), \( z = 5 + 3s \)

The text explains that if the lines intersect, they do so at a point where their respective equations are equal for some parameters \( t \) and \( s \). However, since these parameter values generally differ when the lines intersect, different variables (\( r \) and \( s \)) are used to solve the system of equations:

- \( 3 + 4r = -1 + 12s \)
- \( 4 + r = 7 + 6s \)
- \( 1 = 5 + 3s \)

By solving these equations, it is found that \( s = -\frac{4}{3} \) and \( r = -5 \). Substituting back gives the intersection point as \( (a, b, c) = (-17, -1, 1) \).

The text concludes by emphasizing that typically, lines in three-dimensional space have different parameter values at their points of intersection. It also briefly touches on solving systems involving planes and lines using methods like Gauss-Jordan elimination, noting the simplicity when variables are expressed in parametric form.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of solving linear algebra problems involving parametric and symmetric equations of lines, as well as calculating distances between points and planes.

1. **Solving for x in an Equation**: The equation given is \(5x + 0y + 2t = 0\), which simplifies to \(5x = -2t\) or \(x = \frac{-2}{5}t\). This expression, along with similar ones for y and z (not detailed but assumed in context), forms parametric equations of a line where t ranges from negative to positive infinity.

2. **Augmented Matrix and Gauss-Jordan Elimination**: When solving systems of linear equations represented by matrices, one can use Gauss-Jordan elimination to simplify the system. Assigning \(z = t\), you solve for y and x in terms of z or t, reading solutions from bottom to top in an augmented matrix.

3. **Distance Between a Point and a Plane**: The formula for distance is given as:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 + d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are coefficients from the plane equation, while \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) is a point. The example provided calculates the distance using specific values.

4. **Symmetric Equations of a Line**: For a line defined parametrically by \(x = x_0 + at\), \(y = y_0 + bt\), and \(z = z_0 + ct\), you can derive symmetric equations:
   \[
   \frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}
   \]
   This is demonstrated with a specific point and direction vector, converting the parametric form into its symmetric equivalent.

Overall, these explanations cover solving linear equations, using matrix methods for systems of equations, calculating distances in geometry, and transforming between different forms of line equations.

The text discusses determining whether two lines in three-dimensional space intersect and, if so, where. The given equations of the two lines are:

1. Line 1: 
   - \( x = 3 + 4t \)
   - \( y = 4 + t \)
   - \( z = 1 \)

2. Line 2:
   - \( x = -1 + 12s \)
   - \( y = 7 + 6s \)
   - \( z = 5 + 3s \)

To find an intersection, the coordinates \( (x, y, z) \) must be equal for some values of parameters \( t \) and \( s \). The text points out that these parameter values will generally differ if the lines intersect, so we assign different variables to them.

Solving the equations:
- From \( z = 1 \) in Line 1 and \( z = 5 + 3s \) in Line 2: 
  - Set \( 1 = 5 + 3s \)
  - Solving gives \( s = -\frac{4}{3} \)

Using this value of \( s \), solve for \( t \):
- From \( x = 3 + 4t \) and \( x = -1 + 12s \):
  - Set \( 3 + 4r = -1 + 12(-\frac{4}{3}) \)
  - Solve to find \( r = -5 \)

Now, substitute these values back to find the intersection point:
- For Line 1 with \( t = -5 \): 
  - \( x = 3 + 4(-5) = -17 \)
  - \( y = 4 + (-5) = -1 \)
  - \( z = 1 \)

Thus, the lines intersect at point \( (-17, -1, 1) \).

The text emphasizes that solving such problems can be simplified by using different parameters for each line and recognizing when equations are straightforward enough to avoid complex methods like matrix row reduction.

The text covers several mathematical concepts related to solving linear algebra problems and geometry:

1. **Solving for x in an Equation**: The equation \(5x + 2t = 0\) leads to finding \(x = -\frac{2}{5}t\). These are part of parametric equations representing a line or plane.

2. **Parametric Equations**: Three parametric equations are described, with the variable \(t\) ranging from negative to positive infinity. The text hints at using techniques like Gauss-Jordan elimination for more complex systems involving two equations.

3. **Distance Between a Point and a Plane**: To find the distance between a point \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) and a plane \(ax + by + cz + d = 0\), use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 + d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}
   \]
   This involves identifying constants \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) from the plane equation.

4. **Symmetric Equations of a Line**: The parametric form \(x = x_0 + at, y = y_0 + bt, z = z_0 + ct\) can be rewritten as symmetric equations:
   \[
   \frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}
   \]
   This shows how a line through a point and parallel to a vector can be expressed.

5. **Example of Symmetric Equations**: For a line through the point \((3, -1, 2)\) and parallel to the vector \(\langle 2, 1, 3 \rangle\), the symmetric equations are:
   \[
   \frac{x - 3}{2} = y + 1 = \frac{z - 2}{3}
   \]

These concepts collectively explain how to handle linear algebra problems involving lines and planes in three-dimensional space.
