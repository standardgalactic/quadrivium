This video covers biliary colic, a condition associated with gallstone disease. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Incidence and Symptoms**: 
   - About 9% of women and 6% of men develop gallstones, but only 15% experience biliary colic.
   - Once biliary colic occurs, there is an 85% chance of repeated attacks, with a 2-3% annual risk of complications like cholecystitis.

2. **Pathophysiology**:
   - Biliary colic arises when gallstones block bile flow from the cystic duct, causing severe pain, often after fatty meals.
   - The pain is typically in the right upper quadrant and lasts between 30 minutes to several hours.

3. **Diagnosis**:
   - Ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool, used to identify gallstones without signs of complications for biliary colic.
   - If symptoms are typical but no stones are found initially, a repeat ultrasound may be necessary after two weeks.

4. **Management**:
   - Effective pain relief with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is recommended unless contraindicated; alternatives like cephine can be used safely.
   - Blood tests to check for signs of cholecystitis or pancreatitis are important, along with monitoring electrolytes if vomiting occurs.

5. **Treatment**:
   - The definitive treatment for biliary colic is a cholecystectomy, which can typically be scheduled electively due to the high risk of repeated attacks and complications.
   - For patients unfit for surgery or who refuse it, expectant management using simple analgesics is advised, with guidance on when to seek hospital care.

6. **Other Considerations**:
   - Other treatments like external beam lithotripsy are ineffective, and managing cholesterol does not impact gallstone disease outcomes.
