The text describes the process of determining the depth of water in a well that acts as an open-closed system (open at the top and closed at the bottom). The fundamental frequency for the sound wave produced by this setup is given as 7.00 hertz. Key parameters provided include the density of air (\(1.10 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)) and the bulk modulus of air (\(1.33 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}\)).

To find the depth (length \(L\)) of the water in the well, we use the formula for the fundamental frequency of an open-closed tube:

\[ f_1 = \frac{v}{4L} \]

where \(f_1\) is the fundamental frequency, and \(v\) is the speed of sound in air. The speed of sound can be calculated using:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{\text{bulk modulus}}{\text{density}}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{1.33 \times 10^5}{1.10}} \]

Once \(v\) is determined, it's substituted back into the frequency equation to solve for \(L\):

\[ L = \frac{v}{4f_1} \]

After calculations, the depth of the water (length \(L\)) is found to be approximately 12.4 meters. This involves basic algebraic manipulation by substituting known values and solving for the unknown length.
