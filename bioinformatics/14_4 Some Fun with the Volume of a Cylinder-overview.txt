The text describes how to calculate the volume of a cylinder using double integrals in calculus. The process involves:

1. **Understanding the Geometry**: A cylinder is characterized by its circular base and height (h). Its base can be defined as \( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \), where \( a \) is the radius.

2. **Setting Up the Integral**:
   - Define the region for integration: The limits for \( y \) are from 0 to \( \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \), and for \( x \), they range from 0 to \( a \).
   - Construct an iterated double integral with respect to \( y \) and then \( x \).

3. **Performing the Integration**:
   - The inner integral involves integrating over \( y \) from 0 to \( \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \), treating height (\( h \)) as a constant.
   - For the outer integral, use trigonometric substitution with \( x = a \sin(\theta) \). This transforms the limits of integration for \( \theta \) from 0 to \( \pi/2 \).

4. **Simplifying Using Trigonometric Identities**:
   - Recognize that \( 1 - \sin^2(\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) \).
   - Use trigonometric identities such as the half-angle formula for integrating \( \cos^2(\theta) \).

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Integrate to find the volume, using the result of the double integral and incorporating the constant height (\( h \)).

This method demonstrates how calculus can be applied to solve geometric problems involving volumes by transforming them into manageable integrals.

The text explains how to derive the formula for the volume of a cylinder using integration. It starts by setting up an integral involving \(\theta\) from 0 to \(\pi/2\), and integrates \(\cos(2\theta)\). By differentiating the integrated function, it confirms that the result involves cosine terms. The calculation results in \(h a^2\) times some constants derived from the integration limits. Since only a quarter of the cylinder's base is considered, the final volume needs to be multiplied by 4, leading to \(h a^2 \pi\). Recognizing that \(a\) is the radius (\(r\)), this simplifies to \(\pi r^2 h\), which is the standard formula for the volume of a cylinder. The text suggests that similar calculus techniques can be used to find volumes of other shapes, such as spheres, using double integrals.
