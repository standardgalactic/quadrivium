so let's do another problem as far as repeated eigenvalues are concerned so just a term i might
have used it before but just to mention it properly multiplicity that is where we're going to get a
repeated real eigenvalue say to the power 2 lambda plus 3 squared that will be multiplicity 2 and
that multiplicity we call m remember we had that long equation to write x sub m
um that m i think before i might also just have written less than is less than or equal to n where
n is the size of the matrix a the square matrix a and i want to remind you let's do a problem here
with multiplicity 2. so we're going to have these two solutions x sub 1 which is going to be
the eigenvector k e to the power lambda sub 1t and x sub 2 is going to be k t e to the power lambda sub 1t
plus p e to the power lambda sub 1t in other words this comes from that long equation remember how
the way that you could write x sub m with the t to the power m minus 1 over m minus 1 factorial etc
just to remind you then k is for this multiplicity 2 it's going to be an eigenvector k sub 1 k sub 2
and p is going to be a column vector as well p sub 1 p sub 2 so there's our problem x prime equals
our square matrix here 3 negative 18 2 and negative 9x as per usual we're just going to look at what a
minus lambda i is because we need to get first of all our eigenvalues so that is simply going to be
3 minus lambda and negative 18 and negative 9 minus lambda we're going to get the determinant of this
and we're going to set that equal to zero so the determinant of this now let's just do it
so it's going to be 3 minus lambda times negative 9 minus lambda and negative 36 there but minus negative
36 becomes positive 36 and that's going to equal zero so let's see we have negative 27 we have negative
3 lambda we have a positive 9 lambda and we have a positive lambda squared and plus 36
that's going to equal zero so we have lambda squared plus 6 lambda plus 9 equals 0 and then lo and
behold that's lambda plus 3 squared so the multiplicity of the repeated eigenvalue here is 2 2 is m
m larger or smaller than n n size is 2 it's a 2 by 2 square matrix so indeed we fall there with
multiplicity 2 we know we're going to have these two solutions we don't have a third it's not a 3 by 3
matrix so that's all we have so we know lambda sub 1 equals lambda sub 2 has got to be negative 3.
now we're going to use that fact first of all for our x sub 1 and we know that lambda
minus negative 3 which will become positive 3i so that's positive not lambda a what am i doing a
that's negative minus minus negative 3 which is positive 3i times k is going to equal a zero vector
this is vector multiplication so that's not simply zero that has got to be the zero column vector so what
are we looking for we're looking for k our eigen our eigenvector so how many eigenvectors can we make
from this single eigenvalue remember i said you're either going to just make one or more than one and
that's going to give you two different types of solutions so what is a plus 3i so 3 plus 3 is 6
and negative 18 and 2 and negative 9 plus 3 is negative 6 so that's our vector there and we've
got to multiply it by k1 and k2 let's just do it the long way i think before i showed you how you can
just do an augmented matrix to get those solutions so it's going to be 6 times k sub 1 minus 18 times
k sub 2 equals 0 so we have 6 times k sub 1 equals 18 times k sub 2 or k sub 1 equals 3 times k sub 2
so i can look at one example my k eigenvector here would be
3 1 because i let k sub 2 equal 1 that means k sub 3
it's got to be it's got to be it's got to be it's got to be one and anything will just be constant
multiples of that so here i just have a single i can only get a single
eigenvector for this repeated eigenvalue therefore i've got to go for that remember it was k sub m
equals what was it k 1 m and t to the power m minus 1 over m minus 1 factorial e to the power
lambda sub 1 t plus then we were going to have k 2 m and it was going to be t to the power m minus 2
over m minus 2 factorial e to the power lambda sub 1 t and if you plug in those values you are going to
get for m 1 you're going to get that and for m 2 you're going to get that instead of writing k 2 m
we're writing just that as p and k 1 m we're writing as k let me just clear the board i'm going to stop
the recording just to clear the board and we'll carry on
good now we've got to have the fact that
a minus negative 3 so that will be 3i times p the vector p is now going to equal the vector k
so i'm still i'm still left with that and now i'm just going to multiply it by p1 and p2 so i'm still
left with 6 negative 18 2 negative 6 and now i'm going to multiply it by p sub 1 and p sub 2
and what do i get and that's going to equal k and k is equal to 3 1 so i'm going to get 6 times p sub 1
minus 18 p sub 2
or 2 times p sub 1 minus 6 times p sub 2 that's exactly the same it's going to equal vector k which
is 3 1 so let's have a look 6 times p sub 1 minus 18 times p sub 2 is going to equal 3 and i can say
p sub 1 equals divide everything by 6 so that'll be a half and plus 18 divided by 6 plus 3 times p sub 2
so i let's say p sub 2 equals 0 so that's 0 so in other words i can write one as a half
0 as a half and zero so here i would have now my set of solutions now what i'm interested in i've got
this now which will be 3 1 e to the power negative 3t that's my one set i'm going to put a c sub 1 there
and i've got to put a c sub 2 here because i'm interested in a general set of solutions
so x is going to be c sub 1 for that first solution which was 3 1 e to the power negative 3t
plus c sub 2 then for my second set which is there which is going to be what it's k which is 3 and 1
t e to the power negative 3t
and p which we got as a half and zero plus a half
0 e to the power negative 3t
okay so don't get those confused that you will you will need for the general set solution set you
need both you need both of these x sub 1 and x sub 2 so there's my x sub 1 which is just the k in
and there's the x sub 2 remember i had to make use of this
equation because for my repeated eigenvalue my repeated eigenvalue of multiplicity 2 i could only get
one vector i could only get one eigenvector therefore i had to go for this but this is not
the only solution remember you've got to have x1 you've got to have x1 in there as well
