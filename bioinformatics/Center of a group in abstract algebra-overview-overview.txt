The text outlines how to prove that the center of a group \( Z(G) \) is a subgroup of the group \( G \). The center \( Z(G) \) consists of elements in \( G \) that commute with every element in \( G \), meaning for any \( z \in Z(G) \) and \( g \in G \), \( zg = gz \).

To demonstrate that \( Z(G) \) is a subgroup, it must satisfy four properties:

1. **Closure**: If \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are in \( Z(G) \), then their product \( g_1g_2 \) is also in \( Z(G) \). This holds because for any \( s \in G \), the operations commute as shown: \( (g_1g_2)s = s(g_1g_2) \).

2. **Associativity**: Associativity is inherited from \( G \), so it naturally applies to \( Z(G) \).

3. **Identity Element**: The identity element \( e \) of \( G \) commutes with all elements in \( G \), so \( e \in Z(G) \).

4. **Inverses**: For any \( g \in Z(G) \), its inverse \( g^{-1} \) is also in \( Z(G) \). This is shown by demonstrating that \( g^{-1}s = sg^{-1} \) for any \( s \in G \).

Since these properties are satisfied, \( Z(G) \) is confirmed to be a subgroup of \( G \).
