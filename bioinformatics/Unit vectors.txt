Okay, the wind is blowing outside, but I want to talk to you about unit vectors.
Let's have unit vectors.
Very important concept as far as working with vectors is concerned.
Now remember when we talked about vectors, say a vector in two-dimensional space,
I have this vector here.
Let's make it this is 4 and that is 3 on my y-axis and my x-axis.
So this is this point 4,3.
This is now my vector which I can write as 4 and 3.
That is my vector v.
This is my vector v.
So in vector notation, column vector, it's a point in a plane.
And we could work out the norm of this vector, the length of this vector v.
Norm we write like that.
And that is what the x-value squared plus the y-value squared.
If we had this in three-dimensional space.
If these were all right angles to each other and this was x, y and z plane.
And we had this vector come out.
We would have x squared plus y squared plus z squared.
And we can take that up into a higher, into higher dimensions as well.
So that was the norm of this vector.
But what if I have this vector, this vector.
Now this vector here is the addition of these two.
So if I had these two vectors and that's the beauty of these vectors,
I can deconstruct any vector according to these axes.
And later we'll see we don't actually have to use these axes.
Very important concepts.
I don't have to do that.
Now let's get to this concept of the unit vector.
A unit vector is a vector with a norm of 1.
A norm of 1.
Exactly 1.
So the length of it is 1.
So if this was 4, let's make that 2, 1, 3.
So 3, 2, 1.
It will have a norm of 1.
And if this was 1, 2, 3 there, that will have a norm of 1.
Now think about it.
This vector here along the x axis, this 4, is just...
So let's just look at this vector.
So let's look at...
We'll just call this vector x for...
Just to write something.
It will have along the x axis a 1 and on the y axis a 0.
And if I look at the x component of vector v, I hope you can see down here.
If I look at the x component of vector v, that is just 4 times 1, 0.
Because that will give me this component here, which is 4, 0.
4, 0.
So it's a scalar multiplication.
And we haven't discussed that, but it's just multiplication of each of these...
Of this one with each of these.
That still gives me 4, 0.
So it's 4 along the x axis, nothing along the y axis.
So there's something special about this unit vector.
Because I can just multiply it by the scalar to get this one.
The same is going to happen there.
So the y component of v, that is this 0 and 3.
But that is nothing other than 3 times 0 and 1.
And this 0 and 1 is this unit vector in the y direction.
Let's make it y hat.
And let's make this x1 x hat.
Just to indicate that it's a unit vector.
Some books, many books use this hat notation.
So that's this 0 and 1.
And if you were to just use the Pythagorean theorem, you'd very quickly see that,
well, the length of that must be 1.
So what about this vector here?
Before we get that, there's something subtly I want you to see.
If I have this plane and I have these two unit vectors, I can add these two unit vectors.
Let's make it x hat and y hat.
If I add those two, so that would be 1, 0, plus 0, 1.
And that's going to give me 1, 1.
1, 1.
And that would be a point 1, 1, which will be up.
1, 1 will be up there.
Okay.
If I were to put a constant in front of this one and another constant in front of this one.
And those constants, remember, can be 0.
They can be negative.
I can get to any point in the plane.
You give me a point in this plane.
I can use these two unit vectors multiplied by a scalar.
Because this one can get longer and shorter in this way.
This one can go this way and this way.
And I can get to any point in this plane.
And if I go to three dimensions, I can get to any point in three dimensions.
If I had another one.
If I had three dimensions there.
Plus c3 then and 0, 0, 1.
There's something very special about these unit vectors.
They allow us to really get to anywhere in a space.
There's something very special about them.
That I can utilize them to get anywhere in a space.
And we'll really look at that again in future lectures.
There's something very special about these unit vectors.
So that's a unit vector there.
As far as this vector and that vector was concerned.
But what about just a unit vector of this?
We can construct here also something that's of length one.
A norm of one.
And if I were to multiply that by a scalar.
I'll get this original one.
So how do we go about that?
So that vector there.
That vector v was four and three in column notation.
If I were to multiply both with one over.
One over the norm of v.
Think about it.
One over the norm of v.
One over the length of that.
So I'm dividing that.
Each of these components.
By that.
So I'm taking this.
Multiplying by that.
Taking this.
Multiplying by that.
So what is the norm of this vector?
Well, three plus three.
Three times three is nine.
Where are we?
So four squared is 16.
And three squared is nine.
And that gives me 25.
So the norm of this thing is five.
So that is going to be one over five.
And four and three.
And three.
So I'm going to get this four fifths.
And three fifths.
That is my unit vector.
And if you use the Pythagorean theorem.
You'll see that this equals one.
So it is this norm equals one.
Just one.
And if I were to multiply this by five.
I would get this vector.
So I can deconstruct this vector into its unit vector.
Of length one.
And to get to it.
I can just multiply by that.
So two very important concepts here.
One is to remember this.
Equation for.
Getting the unit vector of any vector.
It's one over the norm of that vector.
Then times each of the components.
And the other thing is.
If I look at just how this vector is deconstructed.
Along these two axes.
They are perpendicular there.
I can use this fact.
To get to any.
Any point in the plane.
If it's two dimensions in.
3D space.
If it's three dimensions.
And if it's higher.
High dimensions.
I can get to any point.
And we'll look at how special these unit vectors are.
And it doesn't necessarily have to be these.
We'll look at.
How we can construct these.
So I can still get.
To every point.
In the plane.
Or in the space.
So in short.
That's a unit vector.
Unit vector.
And.
The.
The concept.
Of.
Getting to.
Every point.
Just by the use.
Of.
A unit vector.
Good.
Let's have a look.
At unit vectors.
Remember.
The norm of a vector.
If I.
Were to have a vector.
And I would just.
To say.
The norm.
And let's keep it.
Four comma three.
And we were to do that.
We'd see that.
The length.
Of that.
Is five.
And I.
If I were to take.
One over five.
And remember.
I can do that.
By control.
Or command.
Forward slash.
Just to get the fraction.
Otherwise.
You could just.
Say.
One.
Divided by five.
Let's do that.
Just.
Just.
Just for the sake of it.
I can put it in.
Parentheses.
One divided by five.
That's going to be.
Exactly the same thing.
Three.
And if I were to do that.
I get this.
Vector.
Four comma.
Four over five.
And three over five.
And if I were to look.
At the norm.
Of that vector.
And remember.
I can just use.
The percent.
Symbol.
Because that is what.
We had just.
Executed.
And it's going to give me.
A norm of one.
So the norm.
Of that vector.
Is one.
That is a unit vector.
And if I were to say.
Five.
Times.
And.
Let's put that.
That vector in.
Four over five.
And three over five.
And three over five.
It's quite obvious.
What's going to happen here.
Is that.
We are just going to get back.
To the initial vector.
So any initial vector.
Can be.
Let's say.
Deconstructed.
Into its unit vector.
Which will have a length of one.
And just a scalar multiple.
To get back.
To that.
To that original vector.
And I'm back.
At the original vector.
Of four.
Of four comma three.
So that's one way.
To go about it.
I can also.
Look at the function.
Called normalize.
If I were to use.
Normalize.
And I'm going to.
Pass in that.
Very same vector.
Four comma three.
Let's have a look at that.
And.
That will do all of this.
For me.
Automatically.
Unit vector.
Of.
That vector.
Without any problems.
There is.
A.
Function.
And.
It is called.
Unit vector.
And.
Let's have a look.
At.
How that works.
I'm going to say.
Unit vector.
Unit vector.
And.
Very simply.
There are.
Two arguments.
That I'm going to.
Pass here.
First of all.
Is the number of.
Dimensions.
Of my space.
Let's say.
Is.
Three.
And.
I want.
The second.
Unit vector.
In that.
Three space.
And.
There we go.
At.
Zero.
One.
Zero.
As we said.
Let's make a little table.
We're going to make a little table.
And.
We're going to make it of.
Unit vectors.
Unit vectors.
And.
Let's make it in.
Three dimensional space.
Comma.
I'm going to count them off.
N.
And.
We're going to make.
Unit.
Unit vectors.
Inside.
Of.
Three dimensional space.
They're going to be along.
The Cartesian plane.
X.
Y.
And.
Z axis.
And.
Once we've done.
All of that.
Let's see.
That I close all of my square.
That I.
All my square brackets are closed.
So let's just make sure of that.
Unit vectors closed.
Everything is closed.
Matrix form.
Of this.
And.
If we look at the matrix form.
Of this.
Just.
Concentrate on the three columns.
For now.
Just the three columns.
I have.
One.
Zero.
Zero.
Zero.
One.
Zero.
Zero.
One.
The norm.
That we wanted.
The matrix form.
Just so that we have.
These column vectors.
But.
It is these.
Three vectors.
That we can see.
The first one.
The second one.
And the third one.
Hence.
There was our second one.
So unit vector.
We'll just give you.
This very easy way.
Just to look at these.
They are quite simple.
If we just look at them.
Orthogonal to each other.
Just to do in your head.
Obviously.
You're just going to bring the one down.
Depending on.
You know.
Which one of the unit vectors.
You're looking at.
So that's quite easy to do.
To go.
The unit vector.
You can do it by.
The norm.
And deconstructing it.
Or just use.
The normalize function.
