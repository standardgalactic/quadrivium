The text outlines the methods for determining the capacitance of cylindrical and spherical capacitors using Gauss's Law.

### Cylindrical Capacitor
1. **Structure**: Two long, thin cylinders with opposite charges.
2. **Gauss's Law Application**:
   - A Gaussian surface is chosen between the inner radius \(A\) and outer radius \(B\).
   - Only the side walls contribute to electric field flux; end caps do not.
3. **Electric Field Calculation**: 
   - The electric field \(E\) at a distance \(R\) from the axis is \(E = \frac{Q}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 L R}\).
4. **Potential Difference**:
   - Integrated from radius \(A\) to \(B\), resulting in \(\Delta V = \frac{Q}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 L} \ln \left(\frac{B}{A}\right)\).
5. **Capacitance Formula**:
   - Capacitance \(C\) is given by \(C = \frac{2 \pi \epsilon_0 L}{\ln(B/A)}\).

### Spherical Capacitor
1. **Structure**: Two concentric hollow spheres with opposite charges.
2. **Gauss's Law Application**:
   - The electric field \(E\) for a spherical Gaussian surface is \(E = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}\).
3. **Potential Difference**:
   - Integrated from radius \(a\) to \(b\), yielding \(\Delta V = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left(\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b}\right)\).
4. **Capacitance Formula**:
   - Capacitance \(C\) is calculated as \(C = \frac{4 \pi \epsilon_0 ab}{b-a}\).

In both cases, Gauss's Law helps determine the electric field, which is then integrated to find the potential difference and derive the capacitance.
