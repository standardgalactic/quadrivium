The text provides an analysis of sequences as \( n \) approaches infinity and explores their convergence or divergence. It starts with a sequence given by:

\[
a_n = \frac{n^2 + 4}{2n + 7}
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), substituting \( n = \infty \) results in an indeterminate form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\). Since L'Hôpital's Rule is not applicable due to the sequence nature, the text suggests simplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by the highest power of \( n \) in the denominator:

\[
a_n = \frac{n + \frac{4}{n}}{2 + \frac{7}{n}}
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), this becomes:

\[
a_n \approx \frac{n}{2} \to \infty
\]

Thus, the sequence diverges as it approaches infinity.

The text clarifies that a sequence does not need to go to infinity to be considered divergent. For example, an alternating sequence like \( (-1)^n \) oscillates between -1 and 1 without converging to a single value or going to infinity.

Furthermore, the text discusses conditions under which convergence of a function implies convergence of its corresponding sequence: if a continuous function \( f(x) \) converges as \( x \to \infty \), then the sequence \( f(n) \) also converges. However, this implication does not work in reverse; a convergent sequence does not guarantee that the function will converge.

An example using the function:

\[
f(x) = \frac{x+1}{e^x}
\]

is examined. Applying L'Hôpital's Rule (since it results in an indeterminate form), the limit as \( x \to \infty \) is found to be 0, demonstrating convergence of both the function and its sequence.

Lastly, the text mentions that arithmetic operations on limits of sequences follow similar rules as with functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on their respective limits if applicable (with caution on division by zero).

The text discusses various methods for determining whether a given mathematical sequence or series converges. Here's a summary:

1. **L'Hôpital's Rule**: This rule is applied when both the numerator and denominator of a fraction tend towards infinity or zero. It involves differentiating the numerator and denominator until a limit can be determined.

2. **Squeeze (Sandwich) Theorem**: This method checks convergence by comparing the sequence to two other sequences that "squeeze" it from above and below, converging to the same limit. For example, the text uses this theorem to show that \(\sin(n)/n^2\) converges to 0 as \(n\) approaches infinity.

3. **Corollary of Squeeze Theorem**: This is presented as tool number four. It states that if the absolute value of a sequence converges to zero, then the original sequence also converges to zero. An example given is \((-1)^n/n\), where taking the absolute value leads to \(1/n\) which converges to 0.

The text emphasizes understanding these tools and knowing when each can be applied, especially differentiating between L'Hôpital's Rule (which requires a specific limit value \(L\)) and the corollary of the Squeeze Theorem (which specifically deals with limits that converge to zero).

The text discusses methods for determining whether a sequence converges as \( n \) approaches infinity. It provides examples and techniques to handle sequences with indeterminate forms such as "infinity over infinity."

1. **Sequence Analysis**: The first example is the sequence \(\frac{n^2 + 4}{2n + 7}\). Direct substitution of \( n \to \infty \) leads to an indeterminate form ("infinity over infinity"). L'Hôpital's rule isn't directly applicable because it's a discrete sequence, not a continuous function. Instead, the method involves dividing both the numerator and denominator by the highest power of \( n \) in the denominator (\( n^1 \)), simplifying to analyze its behavior as \( n \to \infty \). The result shows that this sequence diverges towards infinity.

2. **Divergence Beyond Infinity**: The text notes that a sequence doesn't need to approach infinity to be considered divergent. An example is given where the sequence alternates between -1 and 1, showing it does not settle on any specific value \( L \), thus diverging even though it doesn’t tend toward infinity.

3. **Convergence of Sequences and Functions**: The text explains that if a function \( f(x) \) converges as \( x \to \infty \), then the sequence formed by evaluating \( f(n) \) at integer points also converges to the same limit. However, this implication does not work in reverse; a convergent sequence does not necessarily imply convergence for the corresponding function.

4. **Example with Exponential Functions**: The example given is the sequence \(\frac{n + 1}{e^n}\). By applying L'Hôpital's rule to the related continuous function \( f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{e^x} \), it's shown that this sequence converges to zero.

5. **Limits and Arithmetic**: The text concludes by stating that the arithmetic of limits for sequences mirrors those of functions, with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division following similar rules when dealing with limits of sequences.

Overall, the text provides insight into techniques for analyzing convergence or divergence in sequences as \( n \to \infty \), emphasizing both algebraic manipulation and calculus-based approaches where applicable.

The text provides an overview of several methods used to determine the convergence or divergence of sequences. Here is a summary:

1. **L'Hôpital's Rule**: This method involves dividing both the numerator and denominator by the highest power variable in the denominator and applying L'Hôpital’s rule if the function \( f(x) \) converges to a single value \( L \). The sequence will converge to that same value.

2. **Squeeze (or Sandwich) Theorem**: This approach is used when a sequence oscillates between two bounds, such as \( -1/n^2 \) and \( 1/n^2 \). By showing the limits of these bounding functions tend to zero, one can conclude the original function also converges to zero. An example given is the sequence \( \sin(n)/n^2 \), which is squeezed between \( -1/n^2 \) and \( 1/n^2 \), both tending to zero as \( n \to \infty \).

3. **Corollary of the Squeeze Theorem**: This fourth tool, presented as a corollary to the squeeze theorem, states that if the limit of the absolute value of a sequence tends to zero, then the original sequence also converges to zero. For example, for the sequence \( (-1)^n/n \), taking the absolute value results in \( 1/n \), which converges to zero as \( n \to \infty \). Thus, the original sequence converges to zero.

The text outlines these tools in order of application: first dividing and using L'Hôpital’s rule if applicable, then applying the squeeze theorem, and finally employing the corollary regarding absolute values.
