The text provides an analysis of sequences as \( n \) approaches infinity and explores their convergence or divergence. It starts with a sequence given by:

\[
a_n = \frac{n^2 + 4}{2n + 7}
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), substituting \( n = \infty \) results in an indeterminate form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\). Since L'H么pital's Rule is not applicable due to the sequence nature, the text suggests simplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by the highest power of \( n \) in the denominator:

\[
a_n = \frac{n + \frac{4}{n}}{2 + \frac{7}{n}}
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), this becomes:

\[
a_n \approx \frac{n}{2} \to \infty
\]

Thus, the sequence diverges as it approaches infinity.

The text clarifies that a sequence does not need to go to infinity to be considered divergent. For example, an alternating sequence like \( (-1)^n \) oscillates between -1 and 1 without converging to a single value or going to infinity.

Furthermore, the text discusses conditions under which convergence of a function implies convergence of its corresponding sequence: if a continuous function \( f(x) \) converges as \( x \to \infty \), then the sequence \( f(n) \) also converges. However, this implication does not work in reverse; a convergent sequence does not guarantee that the function will converge.

An example using the function:

\[
f(x) = \frac{x+1}{e^x}
\]

is examined. Applying L'H么pital's Rule (since it results in an indeterminate form), the limit as \( x \to \infty \) is found to be 0, demonstrating convergence of both the function and its sequence.

Lastly, the text mentions that arithmetic operations on limits of sequences follow similar rules as with functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on their respective limits if applicable (with caution on division by zero).

The text discusses various methods for determining whether a given mathematical sequence or series converges. Here's a summary:

1. **L'H么pital's Rule**: This rule is applied when both the numerator and denominator of a fraction tend towards infinity or zero. It involves differentiating the numerator and denominator until a limit can be determined.

2. **Squeeze (Sandwich) Theorem**: This method checks convergence by comparing the sequence to two other sequences that "squeeze" it from above and below, converging to the same limit. For example, the text uses this theorem to show that \(\sin(n)/n^2\) converges to 0 as \(n\) approaches infinity.

3. **Corollary of Squeeze Theorem**: This is presented as tool number four. It states that if the absolute value of a sequence converges to zero, then the original sequence also converges to zero. An example given is \((-1)^n/n\), where taking the absolute value leads to \(1/n\) which converges to 0.

The text emphasizes understanding these tools and knowing when each can be applied, especially differentiating between L'H么pital's Rule (which requires a specific limit value \(L\)) and the corollary of the Squeeze Theorem (which specifically deals with limits that converge to zero).
