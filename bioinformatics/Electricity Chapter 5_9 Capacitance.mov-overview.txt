The text provides an explanation and example related to Gauss's law applied to a dielectric in a capacitor setup.

1. **Gauss's Law with Dielectrics**: The law states the enclosed charge equals ε₀ times the flux, where flux is the surface integral of the electric field dotted with an area vector. In a capacitor with a dielectric, a Gaussian surface reveals induced charges on the dielectric, affecting calculations of enclosed charge.

2. **Example Scenario**:
   - A parallel plate capacitor with an initial setup (without dielectric) has specific parameters: 115 cm² area and a 0.0124 cm gap between plates charged to 85.5 V.
   - The capacitance \( C_0 \) is calculated as ε₀ times the area divided by distance, giving approximately 8.21 picofarads.
   - Free charge on the plates (without dielectric), using \( Q = CV \), results in about 702 picocoulombs.

3. **Electric Field Calculations**:
   - Without a dielectric, the electric field is calculated to be around 6.90 kV/m.
   - With a partial dielectric insertion, the electric field inside the dielectric reduces by its dielectric constant (κ = 2.61), yielding approximately 2.64 kV/m.

4. **Potential Across Plates**:
   - The potential across plates changes due to the presence of the dielectric, considering contributions from both gaps with and without dielectrics.
   - After calculations, the new electric potential is found to be about 52.3 volts.

The text emphasizes understanding how dielectrics modify capacitance, electric fields, and potential in capacitors.

The text discusses Gauss's law in the context of a dielectric material within a capacitor and outlines how the presence of a dielectric affects electric fields, charge distribution, and potential difference across capacitor plates. Here's a summary:

1. **Gauss's Law with Dielectrics**: 
   - Gauss's law states that the enclosed charge is equal to epsilon zero times the flux through a Gaussian surface.
   - When introducing a dielectric into a capacitor, induced charges appear on the dielectric surfaces due to polarization.

2. **Capacitor Setup**:
   - Consider a parallel plate capacitor with given dimensions and an initial voltage applied by a battery that is then removed before inserting a dielectric slab.
   - The dielectric does not fully occupy the gap between plates, leaving a small air-filled region.

3. **Calculations Without Dielectric**:
   - Capacitance (C₀) is calculated using the formula \( C = \epsilon_0 \times \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Distance}} \), resulting in 6.90 kV/m for the electric field and 85.5 V as the potential difference across plates.

4. **Effect of Dielectric**:
   - The dielectric reduces the electric field by a factor equal to its dielectric constant (κ). For this problem, κ = 2.61, reducing the electric field inside the dielectric to 2.64 kV/m.
   - The potential difference across the plates is recalculated considering both the air-filled and dielectric-filled regions, resulting in a new potential of 52.3 V.

5. **Conceptual Points**:
   - Introducing a dielectric reduces the electric field inside it compared to when there's no dielectric.
   - The overall effect on capacitance and voltage can be derived by considering both regions (dielectric-filled and air-filled) separately, then combining them for total potential difference.

This explanation provides a comprehensive overview of how inserting a dielectric affects various properties in a parallel plate capacitor setup.
