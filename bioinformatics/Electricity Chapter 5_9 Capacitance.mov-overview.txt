The text provides an explanation and example related to Gauss's law applied to a dielectric in a capacitor setup.

1. **Gauss's Law with Dielectrics**: The law states the enclosed charge equals ε₀ times the flux, where flux is the surface integral of the electric field dotted with an area vector. In a capacitor with a dielectric, a Gaussian surface reveals induced charges on the dielectric, affecting calculations of enclosed charge.

2. **Example Scenario**:
   - A parallel plate capacitor with an initial setup (without dielectric) has specific parameters: 115 cm² area and a 0.0124 cm gap between plates charged to 85.5 V.
   - The capacitance \( C_0 \) is calculated as ε₀ times the area divided by distance, giving approximately 8.21 picofarads.
   - Free charge on the plates (without dielectric), using \( Q = CV \), results in about 702 picocoulombs.

3. **Electric Field Calculations**:
   - Without a dielectric, the electric field is calculated to be around 6.90 kV/m.
   - With a partial dielectric insertion, the electric field inside the dielectric reduces by its dielectric constant (κ = 2.61), yielding approximately 2.64 kV/m.

4. **Potential Across Plates**:
   - The potential across plates changes due to the presence of the dielectric, considering contributions from both gaps with and without dielectrics.
   - After calculations, the new electric potential is found to be about 52.3 volts.

The text emphasizes understanding how dielectrics modify capacitance, electric fields, and potential in capacitors.
