The text provides a series of problems involving finding derivatives using calculus techniques such as the chain rule and product rule.

1. **First Problem**: The function is \( y = e^{-5x} \). Using the chain rule:
   - Let \( u = -5x \), so \( y = e^u \).
   - Derivative: \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = e^u \cdot (-5) = -5e^{-5x} \).

2. **Second Problem**: The function is \( y = e^{(5-7x)} \). Again, using the chain rule:
   - Let \( u = 5 - 7x \), so \( y = e^u \).
   - Derivative: \( \frac{dy}{dx} = e^u \cdot (-7) = -7e^{(5-7x)} \).

3. **Third Problem**: The function is a difference of two terms, \( y = xe^x - e^x \).
   - For the first term (\( y_1 = xe^x \)), use the product rule:
     - Let \( f(x) = x \), \( g(x) = e^x \); then \( f'(x) = 1 \), \( g'(x) = e^x \).
     - Derivative: \( y_1' = x \cdot e^x + 1 \cdot e^x = xe^x + e^x \).
   - For the second term (\( y_2 = e^x \)), derivative is \( y_2' = e^x \).
   - Combine derivatives: \( y' = (xe^x + e^x) - e^x = xe^x \).

4. **Fourth Problem**: The function is a product, \( y = (x^2 - 2x + 2)e^x \). Use the product rule:
   - Let \( u = x^2 - 2x + 2 \), \( v = e^x \); then \( u' = 2x - 2 \), \( v' = e^x \).
   - Derivative: \( y' = (x^2 - 2x + 2)e^x + (2x - 2)e^x \).
   - Factor out \( e^x \): 
     - \( y' = e^x((x^2 - 2x + 2) + (2x - 2)) = e^x(x^2 + 0x + 0) = x^2e^x \).

The text emphasizes the utility of substitution and the product rule in simplifying complex derivative calculations.
