Yanni, a surgical registrar, discusses coagulation disorders and blood transfusion in trauma patients. He notes that trauma is a major global cause of death, often complicated by a "deadly triangle" consisting of coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis, which are interconnected issues.

### Etiology of Hemostatic Disorders in Trauma:

1. **Dilution**: Fluid resuscitation can dilute clotting factors, becoming problematic with extensive blood volume replacement.
2. **Hypothermia**: Cold transfusions (packed red cells and crystalloid fluids) lower body temperature, impairing platelet function and increasing fibrinolysis.
3. **Specific Trauma Sites**:
   - Brain injuries may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to thromboplastin exposure.
   - Severe liver injuries disrupt clotting factor production.
   - Extensive soft tissue damage can also cause DIC.
4. **Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, chronic liver disease, and anticoagulant use complicate coagulation.

### Recognition and Treatment:

- Abnormal bleeding should be treated immediately without waiting for test results.
- Basic tests include INR, PTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen levels.
- Maintaining a platelet count above 50 is essential to prevent microvascular bleeds in heavily transfused patients.
- Assessing platelet function is challenging due to factors like hypothermia and liver disease.

Yanni highlights the complexity of managing coagulation disorders in trauma patients and stresses the importance of prompt recognition and treatment.
