The text describes a physics problem involving a spring-mass system experiencing simple harmonic motion. Here's a summary:

1. **System Setup**: A 10 N weight stretches a spring by 0.5 meters at equilibrium. The mass is then displaced an additional 10 cm downward and released with an initial upward velocity of -5 m/s.

2. **Spring Constant Calculation**:
   - Using Hookeâ€™s Law, the spring constant \( k \) is determined: 
     \[
     k = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{displacement}} = \frac{10\, \text{N}}{0.05\, \text{m}} = 200\, \text{N/m}
     \]

3. **Mass Calculation**:
   - The weight \( W \) of the mass is given by \( W = mg \).
   - Using \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), the mass \( m \) is calculated as:
     \[
     m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{10\, \text{N}}{10\, \text{m/s}^2} = 1\, \text{kg}
     \]

4. **Equation of Motion**:
   - The equation for free oscillatory motion is given by \( mx'' + kx = 0 \).
   - Substituting values gives: 
     \[
     x'' + 200x = 0
     \]
   - This leads to the auxiliary equation \( m^2 + 200 = 0 \), resulting in complex roots:
     \[
     m_1 = 10\sqrt{2}i, \quad m_2 = -10\sqrt{2}i
     \]

5. **General Solution**:
   - The solution is of the form:
     \[
     x(t) = c_1 \cos(10\sqrt{2}t) + c_2 \sin(10\sqrt{2}t)
     \]

6. **Initial Conditions and Constants**:
   - At \( t = 0 \), \( x(0) = 0.1 \, \text{m} \) and \( x'(0) = -5 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - Solving these gives:
     \[
     c_1 = 0.1
     \]
     \[
     10\sqrt{2}c_2 = -5 \Rightarrow c_2 = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}
     \]

7. **Final Solution**:
   - The position as a function of time is:
     \[
     x(t) = 0.1 \cos(10\sqrt{2}t) - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \sin(10\sqrt{2}t)
     \]

8. **Amplitude Consideration**:
   - Due to the initial velocity, the amplitude is not simply the additional 10 cm displacement but includes contributions from both \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

This setup illustrates how initial conditions affect the motion of a mass-spring system in simple harmonic motion.
