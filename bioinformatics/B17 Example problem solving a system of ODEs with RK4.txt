now let's move on to this example we're going to do a system of equations using fourth order
runga cutter i remind you up here how to move along the x-axis how to move along the y-axis
and then alternatively we've got to do m1 k1 m sub 2 k sub 2 m sub 3 k sub 3 etc
the m sub 1 is going to refer to the f function and the k sub 1 2 3 and 4 is going to refer to the g
function you'll note every subsequent time here i need m1 so i should already have done m1
and i need k1 as well so i should already have done k1 etc so we move along until we get to k sub 4
and then we can use those once we have m sub 1 2 through m sub 4 and k sub 1 2 through k sub 4
this is clean this up a bit there should be a 1 there and there should be m sub 2 m sub 3 this
probably still comes from my previous messing up of of this equation up here so it's m sub 1
twice m sub 2 twice m sub 3 and m sub 4 it's a weighted average hence the division by 6 k sub 1
twice k sub 2 twice k sub 3 and k sub 4 good here's our example it's a system of first order differential
equations i have the fact that x prime is 2x minus y and y prime is just x so y prime is going to be my
g function of t x and y and my x prime is going to be a function of t x and y note there no t's in here
i'm going to set x sub 0 equal to 1 and y sub 0 equal to 5 denoting that this is actually a fun both
are functions of time of functions of t so if i were to plot them individually both with a with
a on the x axis being if i can call it that the t axis i'll have two graphs one for x and one for y
both on the vertical axis if in a cartesian plane so we're going to make our step size 0.05 and
there's our initial t being 0 now i'm importing the matplotlib library and specifically the pyplot
part of the matplot library and i'm calling that plt so you say import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
you have to have installed the correct version for your version of python of this matplotlib
this matplot mathematical plotting library let's set our initial values x being 1 y being
5 t being 0 careful to put those points behind so as to tell python that these are floating point
values our step size being 0.05 i'm printing out the the values t x and y as strings with the two tabs in
between then printing the actual values so that'll be the initial t the initial x the initial y
i'm creating my loop with entering it as long as t equals is less than one with a small step size
so there we go once i go through m sub 1 and k sub 1 is still going to refer to the old values values of x
and y but now we're going to come to m sub 2 and m sub 2 does require my f functions x and its y but i want
older versions or i actually need special versions of those remember if i look up here
for f for t i need t plus h over 2 for x i need x sub n time plus h over 2 times m sub 1 and for y
i need to get these values for t x and y first and then plug them into the function f
so i need to do and i've called them here if t2 if x2 and if y2 i have to calculate them first and then
use them in 2 times x minus y
now the same is going to happen here to the to to t uh if i go here to the k function which is just
x and for that i actually just need x i don't really need t and x but we're going to do d gt2
gx2 and gy2 and then we're going to multiply there for m i need the f again the x and the y and i've done
them there etc right through to the end until i am at the end t equals t plus h because i've got to grow
it as i go through the plot again through the while loop again and then my values for x and y growing
as the old x times this weighted value times h now this is for v python i'm going to leave it there
so we're just going to say plt remember which was an instance of my piplot dot mathplotlib.pyplot library
and i want t versus x and t versus y it's first going to do the xx over let me say horizontal x axis
then the vertical axis horizontal axis vertical axis so we're going to have two graphs in the same plot
and this is code for red squares and green triangles and then when it's calculated all these points
it puts it into a special kind of memory every time i run through
it's going to plot it right in the end let's see if this works hold let's hold thumbs
so there we go neatly all my values of x and y let's just bring them up again there they are
tabulation didn't work properly this one is too long here so we have this
being a bit out of sync but it's just to make life a little bit easier to read and there we can see the
plots for the um for the squares and the triangles green triangles and the red squares
so that you know which graph is which
