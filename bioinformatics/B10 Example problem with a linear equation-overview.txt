The text discusses solving a non-homogeneous first-order linear differential equation where \( P(x) = -3 \) and the function \( f(x) = 6 \). The solution process involves finding an integrating factor, which is \( e^{-3x} \). This factor is used to transform the differential equation into a form that allows integration.

The steps include:

1. Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor.
2. Recognizing the left side as the derivative of a product, allowing it to be expressed in terms of \( u'v + uv' \).
3. Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \) after simplifying using substitution (\( u = -3x \)).
4. Solving for \( y \), resulting in \( y = -2 + 6e^{3x} + Ce^{3x} \).

The solution consists of a particular solution, \( y_p = -2 + 6e^{3x} \), and a homogeneous solution, \( y_h = Ce^{3x} \). The constant \( C \) represents the family of solutions for the homogeneous equation. Combining these gives the general solution to the original non-homogeneous differential equation.
