The text discusses solving a non-homogeneous first-order linear differential equation where \( P(x) = -3 \) and the function \( f(x) = 6 \). The solution process involves finding an integrating factor, which is \( e^{-3x} \). This factor is used to transform the differential equation into a form that allows integration.

The steps include:

1. Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor.
2. Recognizing the left side as the derivative of a product, allowing it to be expressed in terms of \( u'v + uv' \).
3. Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \) after simplifying using substitution (\( u = -3x \)).
4. Solving for \( y \), resulting in \( y = -2 + 6e^{3x} + Ce^{3x} \).

The solution consists of a particular solution, \( y_p = -2 + 6e^{3x} \), and a homogeneous solution, \( y_h = Ce^{3x} \). The constant \( C \) represents the family of solutions for the homogeneous equation. Combining these gives the general solution to the original non-homogeneous differential equation.

The text describes solving a non-homogeneous first-order linear differential equation using an integrating factor method. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Setup**: The differential equation is given as \( P(x) = -3 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). It introduces these functions, noting they are coefficients but can be considered as functions of \( x \).

2. **Integrating Factor**: To solve the equation, an integrating factor is needed. This is calculated as \( e^{\int -3 \, dx} = e^{-3x} \).

3. **Multiplication and Simplification**: The differential equation is multiplied by this integrating factor to facilitate integration.

4. **Integration Process**:
   - Recognizing a product rule form, the left-hand side simplifies to the derivative of \( (e^{-3x}y) \).
   - Integrating both sides with respect to \( x \), the integral on the right is evaluated using substitution: Let \( u = -3x \), then \( du/dx = -3 \).

5. **Solution Formulation**:
   - The integration results in an expression involving a constant of integration, \( C \).
   - Solving for \( y \), the solution is expressed as \( y = -2 + 6e^{3x} + Ce^{3x} \).

6. **Homogeneous and Particular Solutions**: 
   - The general solution consists of a homogeneous part (\( Ce^{3x} \)) and a particular solution (\(-2\)).
   - The constant \( C \) represents the family of solutions to the homogeneous equation.

7. **Conclusion**: The final solution combines these parts, providing a complete set of solutions for the original differential equation.

The text reflects on solving this using methods from single-variable calculus, emphasizing both understanding and application in finding the general solution to the linear differential equation.
