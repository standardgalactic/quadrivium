The text discusses equivalence relations and how they partition a set into disjoint subsets called equivalence classes or sets. It introduces the notation for these classes using square brackets to denote all elements \( Y \) of a larger set \( A \) that satisfy a specific relation with \( A \). The key properties of an equivalence relation—reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity—are highlighted as essential tools in proving statements about these sets.

The text provides guidance on proving two important points:
1. An element \( A \) is always part of its own equivalence class.
2. If another element \( B \) belongs to the equivalence class of \( A \), then their classes are identical, meaning \( B \)'s class contains no new elements beyond those in \( A \)'s class.

To prove this, it uses properties of equivalence relations: if \( B \) is related to \( A \), and any element \( x \) related to \( B \) must also relate to \( A \) by transitivity. Thus, all members of \( B \)'s class are in \( A \)'s class, implying that these classes overlap entirely (i.e., they are the same). The symmetric property is used to reverse relationships and show bidirectional inclusion between sets.

Lastly, it hints at a more complex proof regarding the intersection of two different equivalence classes being empty if they are distinct. This ensures that equivalence classes truly partition the set without overlap, reinforcing the idea that each element belongs to exactly one equivalence class. The text encourages students to explore this further in textbooks, as proving such properties might be challenging but is crucial for understanding partitions formed by equivalence relations.
