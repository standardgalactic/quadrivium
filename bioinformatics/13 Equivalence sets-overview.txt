The text discusses equivalence relations and how they partition a set into disjoint subsets called equivalence classes or sets. It introduces the notation for these classes using square brackets to denote all elements \( Y \) of a larger set \( A \) that satisfy a specific relation with \( A \). The key properties of an equivalence relation—reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity—are highlighted as essential tools in proving statements about these sets.

The text provides guidance on proving two important points:
1. An element \( A \) is always part of its own equivalence class.
2. If another element \( B \) belongs to the equivalence class of \( A \), then their classes are identical, meaning \( B \)'s class contains no new elements beyond those in \( A \)'s class.

To prove this, it uses properties of equivalence relations: if \( B \) is related to \( A \), and any element \( x \) related to \( B \) must also relate to \( A \) by transitivity. Thus, all members of \( B \)'s class are in \( A \)'s class, implying that these classes overlap entirely (i.e., they are the same). The symmetric property is used to reverse relationships and show bidirectional inclusion between sets.

Lastly, it hints at a more complex proof regarding the intersection of two different equivalence classes being empty if they are distinct. This ensures that equivalence classes truly partition the set without overlap, reinforcing the idea that each element belongs to exactly one equivalence class. The text encourages students to explore this further in textbooks, as proving such properties might be challenging but is crucial for understanding partitions formed by equivalence relations.

The text explains how an equivalence relation partitions a set into distinct subsets called equivalence classes or equivalence sets. These subsets have specific properties: their union forms the original set \( A \), and any two different subsets intersect only at the empty set.

Key points include:

1. **Notation**: Equivalence classes are denoted with square brackets around elements that satisfy the relation within the larger set \( A \).

2. **Proving Properties**:
   - It's straightforward to show that an element \( A \) belongs to its own equivalence class since it satisfies the defining relation.
   - More challenging is proving that if an element \( B \) is in the equivalence class of \( A \), then their equivalence classes are identical, i.e., they contain the same elements.

3. **Proof Using Equivalence Relation Properties**:
   - **Reflexivity**: Every element relates to itself.
   - **Symmetry**: If one element relates to another, the reverse is also true.
   - **Transitivity**: If an element relates to a second, and the second relates to a third, then the first relates to the third.

4. **Proof Steps**:
   - Given \( B \) in the equivalence class of \( A \), use transitivity to show any element related to \( B \) is also related to \( A \).
   - Use symmetry to demonstrate that if \( B \) is related to \( A \), then \( A \) is related to \( B \).
   - Show that all elements in the equivalence class of \( A \) are in the equivalence class of \( B \) and vice versa, proving they are equal.

5. **Further Considerations**:
   - The text mentions a more complex proof regarding intersections of equivalence classes, suggesting it might be too advanced for some exams but useful for understanding deeper properties.
   - The core idea is that if two equivalence classes intersect non-trivially (not just at the empty set), they must actually be the same class.

Overall, the text provides insights into proving fundamental properties of equivalence relations and their resulting partitions.
