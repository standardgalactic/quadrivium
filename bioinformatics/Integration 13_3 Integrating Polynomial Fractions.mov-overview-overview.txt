The text describes how to handle "improper fractions" in polynomials, where the degree of the numerator is equal to or greater than that of the denominator. This situation is managed through polynomial long division, similar to numerical fractions. The process involves dividing the leading term of the numerator by the leading term of the denominator and subtracting the resulting product from the original numerator. Steps are repeated until the remainder has a degree less than the denominator. 

For example, with \(x^3\) in the numerator and \(x^2 + x - 2\) in the denominator:

1. Divide \(x^3\) by \(x^2\) to get \(x\).
2. Multiply \(x\) by the entire denominator \((x^2 + x - 2)\) and subtract this from the original polynomial.
3. Continue dividing until the remainder has a lower degree than the denominator.

The result is expressed as a "proper fraction," combining a quotient (e.g., \(x - 1\)) representing the whole part, with a fractional remainder over the original divisor \(\left(\frac{3x - 2}{x^2 + x - 2}\right)\). This technique converts an improper polynomial fraction into a proper one by separating it into a polynomial quotient and a proper fractional component.
