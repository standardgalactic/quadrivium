This chapter focuses on the esophagus, covering its embryology, anatomy, physiology, clinical aspects, and related problems. During embryological development, the embryo forms three layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. A primitive gut tube develops from cephalocardinal and lateral folding, with the foregut being the initial segment extending from the pharyngeal tube to the liver outgrowth. As mediastinal structures like the heart and lungs develop, this segment elongates into the esophagus.

The endoderm layer contributes to the epithelial lining of the esophagus, which transitions into squamous cells near the stomach. The mesodermal layer forms both muscle and serosal layers, with the upper two-thirds developing striated muscles controlled by the vagus nerve, while the lower third consists of smooth muscles regulated by the splanchnic nerve.

The chapter promises to explore esophageal anatomy in more detail in subsequent videos.
