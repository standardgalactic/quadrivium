so let's have a look in Julia we enclose strings in double quotation marks you see here one two
quotation marks everything inside because we're using the notebook here that does this red color
for us and we just type in anything we want I've typed in this is a Julia string inside of these
double quotation marks and indeed if I execute that cell we get the whole lot this is a Julia string
and we get those quotation marks now we can add that to a computer variable I've introduced a
variable here called str1 and inside of that variable inside of that space in memory I'm
going to put the string this is a Julia string I'm using the semicolon there so it does not get
printed to the screen and now note the difference I'm going to do two different things I'm just
going to call that computer variable str1 and then I'm going to print str1 now look at the difference
so if I do that I get back exactly what we had before with the quotation marks but if I print it
let's see what we get back there without the quotation marks so let's have a look at that so
if we print it it loses those quotation marks and we only have the text now you might ask what do we
do if we want quotation marks inside of a string for instance here this is a Julia string and I've put
the Julia inside of quotation marks well one way to get to do that is to use these triple quotation
marks tells Julia that we might use quotation marks inside of our string and it is these triple
quotation marks in the beginning and the end that delineate the actual string so you've got the new
variable called str2 and look what happens when I call it there are these backslash now these backslashes
are what we call escape characters it actually tells Julia that whatever follows this is not part of the
code you have to escape it and use it as you would in a regular language so let's print this and just have
a look see the difference there this is a Julia string and the Julia now has quotation marks so see
the difference this up here is what Julia is doing it's inserting these escape characters now you'll
remember from when we did functions this is execute this execute the cell equals 100 and we use this
shorthand as placeholder dollar a and then a was equal to 100 so this is going to say this value is 100
but what if I wanted to include that dollar that would be akin to using the quotation marks that we did with
Julia before so what do we what do we do and in fact this is what we do here you see the escape character
so escape dollar whatever comes after this escape it says well dollar is used for something else it is
actually used as code but in this instance don't use it as code don't use this as code just use
the literal meaning of what is there it's just the dollar sign and then dollar a which was 100 and if
we execute that you'll see this value the value of this item is 100 now it prints this dollar here is
this dollar here it is just escaped to tell Julia to ignore its use as code a better way to perhaps to
do it is to use this notation where we use this placeholder variable the dollar but just put whatever
the variable is in parentheses so we'd know that you know we know what this is all about and we know
that this is the escape now we're going to get exactly the same thing so there's your introduction to
two strings in Julia next up we're going to look at parts of a string or sub strings
