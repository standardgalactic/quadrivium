The text discusses the concept of expressing uncertainty in scientific results, particularly in data science. It highlights how measurements and data collection inherently involve uncertainties due to factors like human error and sampling limitations. The author explains that when we sample from a population, we only capture a fraction of it, which introduces approximations rather than exact representations.

To address this uncertainty, the text introduces "bootstrapping," a statistical method used for resampling with replacement. Bootstrapping involves repeatedly selecting samples from an existing dataset to create new datasets (resamples), allowing each data point in the original sample to appear multiple times. This process helps estimate confidence intervals and provides insight into the reliability of statistics derived from small samples.

The text illustrates bootstrapping by generating a large population with known parameters, then sampling a smaller group to study. By applying bootstrapping, researchers can better understand how their sample-based estimates (like mean or standard deviation) might vary if they had sampled differently or taken more samples. This method enhances the understanding of uncertainty and helps generalize findings from a small sample to a larger population. The author uses Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Plotly for implementation, emphasizing bootstrapping's role in scientific analysis and inference.

The text describes a process known as bootstrap resampling, which involves repeatedly sampling from an original dataset with replacement to generate new samples. In this specific example:

1. **Process**: A sample of 50 data points is selected and then resampled 1000 times with replacement, creating 1000 new datasets.
2. **Objective**: The goal is to calculate the mean of each resample, resulting in a list of 1000 means.
3. **Analysis**: These means are plotted using a kernel density estimate, histogram, and rug plot to visualize their distribution.
4. **Percentile Calculation**: To determine confidence intervals, percentiles (specifically the 2.5% and 97.5%) of these means are calculated. This involves sorting the resampled means and identifying values at specific positions in this sorted list to represent these percentiles.
5. **Example Values**: For a thousand samples, the 25th and 975th values in the sorted means correspond to the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles, respectively (i.e., 94.4 and 100.9).
6. **Interpretation**: These percentile values form bounds that potentially contain the true population mean with a given confidence level (95% in this example). The text suggests these methods help express uncertainty about the population mean derived from sample data.
7. **Confidence Levels**: While a 95% confidence interval is used as an example, different levels (such as 80%) can be chosen based on how narrow or wide one wants the bounds of estimation to be.

Overall, bootstrap resampling provides a way to estimate the distribution of sample means and assess the uncertainty around a population mean when only a single sample is available.

The text discusses confidence intervals and how they are used to express uncertainty in statistical results based on sample data. Here's a summarized breakdown:

1. **Confidence Levels**: The example starts with 95% confidence levels, explaining that this means the calculated interval captures the true population parameter 95 times out of 100 if the study were repeated multiple times.

2. **Bootstrap Resampling**: This method involves generating many possible sample means from the original data to estimate the variability and establish a range (confidence intervals) for the population mean.

3. **Interpretation of Confidence Intervals**:
   - A confidence interval provides an estimated range where the true population parameter is likely to lie, based on the sample.
   - For instance, with a 95% confidence level, if the study were repeated 100 times, 95 of those intervals would capture the true mean.

4. **Uncertainty in Results**:
   - The interval does not guarantee that the specific calculated range contains the population parameter; it indicates the likelihood based on repeated sampling.
   - This concept is crucial for interpreting results from a single study.

5. **Application to Other Statistics**: Confidence intervals are applicable beyond means, such as medians or other statistics like correlation and regression coefficients.

6. **Mathematical Calculation of Confidence Intervals**:
   - While bootstrap resampling is one way to calculate confidence intervals, mathematical approaches (e.g., using the t-distribution in SciPy) can also be employed.
   - The text notes that while these methods are available, understanding through resampling provides deeper insight.

7. **Example with Non-Normal Data**:
   - An example is provided where a sample of 200 subjects from a chi-squared distribution (with degrees of freedom = 10) demonstrates how the median can be analyzed similarly to means.
   - The text highlights that real-world data might not follow normal distributions, affecting the shape and interpretation of confidence intervals.

Overall, the passage emphasizes understanding statistical uncertainty through confidence intervals, highlighting both practical methods and theoretical interpretations.

The text outlines a process for analyzing non-normally distributed data using medians instead of means. Here's a summary:

1. **Data Characteristics**: The sample data is not normally distributed, so the median (9.38) is used instead of the mean to better represent central tendency.

2. **Uncertainty and Confidence Intervals**:
   - To express uncertainty about the true population median, 10,000 re-samples are generated using list comprehension with replacement.
   - These medians are then analyzed to understand their distribution, which is found to be skewed due to the original data's skewness.

3. **Calculating Confidence Intervals**:
   - A 95% confidence interval for the median is calculated by determining the values at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of these re-sampled medians.
   - The lower bound is found to be 8.52, and the upper bound is 9.97.

4. **Results Presentation**:
   - The distribution of medians is plotted alongside the original median (9.38).
   - Despite asymmetry in the bounds around the median, results are presented as a 95% confidence interval from 8.522 to 9.97.

5. **Conclusion**: This method provides a clear way to express uncertainty and confidence about the population median based on skewed sample data.
