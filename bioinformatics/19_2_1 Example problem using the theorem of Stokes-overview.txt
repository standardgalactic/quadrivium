The text describes a problem involving Stokes' theorem, which is used in vector calculus to relate a surface integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface to a line integral around the boundary curve of that surface. The specific problem involves evaluating the line integral \(\oint (y\,dx - 5x\,dy + 3\,dz)\) over a closed curve in three-dimensional space.

Since the problem is in 3-space, Green's theorem isn't applicable; instead, Stokes' theorem is used. The text explains that the orientation of the curve is anti-clockwise when viewed from above (along the positive z-axis), indicating a positive normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \).

The next step involves finding the curl of the vector field \(\mathbf{f} = \langle y, -5x, 3 \rangle\). This is done by computing the determinant of a matrix formed with unit vectors \(\mathbf{i}\), \(\mathbf{j}\), and \(\mathbf{k}\) along with the partial derivatives of \(y\), \(-5x\), and \(3\) concerning \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The resulting curl is found to be \(\langle 0, 0, -6 \rangle\).

The task then requires computing the surface integral of this curl over a specified surface. To find the normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) of the plane defined by the points involved in the curve, vectors between these points are constructed and their cross product is computed to yield an orthogonal vector to the plane.

Finally, using this normal vector and ensuring that it lies on the plane (by confirming a dot product equals zero), one can proceed with applying Stokes' theorem to compute the required surface integral. The specific details for solving the integral itself are not fully described but involve these preliminary steps in setup and calculation.

The text describes the process of solving a surface integral in vector calculus using Stokes' Theorem. Initially, an equation of a plane is derived from linear algebra:

\[ Z = 6 - 3X - 2Y \]

The normal vector \( \mathbf{N} \) to this plane is calculated as \( (3, 2, 1) \), and its norm is \( \sqrt{14} \).

Next, the curl of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is found to be \( (0, 0, -6) \). The dot product of the curl with the normal vector gives:

\[ \frac{-6}{\sqrt{14}} \]

This result is used in evaluating the surface integral over the plane. The differential area element \( dS \) is transformed into \( dA \) on the XY-plane, leading to an integral involving a region defined by the line equation:

\[ Y = -\frac{3}{2}X + 3 \]

The region of integration in the XY-plane extends from \( X = 0 \) to \( X = 2 \), and for each \( X \), \( Y \) ranges from 0 to \(-\frac{3}{2}X + 3\).

After correcting some calculation errors, the integral is evaluated to yield a final result of \(-18\). The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of careful computation in such problems.

The text outlines a problem-solving process for evaluating a line integral using Stokes' theorem. The given line integral is over a closed curve in three-dimensional space and cannot be directly solved with Green’s theorem due to its 3D nature, thus requiring Stokes’ theorem.

Here's a breakdown of the steps outlined:

1. **Problem Setup**: 
   - A vector field \(\mathbf{F} = (y, -5x, 3)\) is given.
   - The integral involves this field over a closed curve in three-dimensional space.

2. **Stokes' Theorem Application**:
   - Stokes' theorem relates the line integral of a vector field around a closed curve to the surface integral of the curl of the field over a surface bounded by the curve.
   - The curl of \(\mathbf{F}\) is calculated using the determinant method, yielding \(\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = (0, 0, -6)\).

3. **Surface Normal Vector**:
   - To apply Stokes' theorem, a normal vector to the surface bounded by the curve is needed.
   - The plane containing the points \(P_1(2, 0, 0)\), \(P_2(0, 3, 0)\), and \(P_3(0, 0, 6)\) is considered.
   - Vectors \(\mathbf{P1P} = (x-2, y, z)\), \(\mathbf{P1P2} = (-2, 3, 0)\), and their cross product are calculated to find a normal vector.

4. **Dot Product Verification**:
   - The normal vector derived from the cross product is checked by ensuring it is orthogonal to vectors in the plane through the dot product.
   - This results in an equation: \(18x + 12y - 6z = 36\), representing the plane's equation.

The problem-solving approach combines vector calculus concepts, including curl computation and finding normal vectors using cross products, to apply Stokes' theorem effectively.

The text describes the process of using linear algebra and vector calculus to solve a problem involving surface integrals. Here's a summary:

1. **Equation of a Plane**: The speaker starts with an equation derived from dividing by 6: \(-Z + 3X - 6 + 2Y = 0\). This simplifies to \(Z = 6 - 3X - 2Y\), representing a plane.

2. **Gradient and Normal Vector**: The gradient of the function \(G(X, Y, Z)\) is calculated as \((3, 2, 1)\). The normal vector \(N\) is then determined by normalizing this gradient: \(\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{14}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}}\right)\).

3. **Curl of a Vector Field**: The curl of the vector field \(F\) is given as \((0, 0, -6)\). The dot product of this curl with the normal vector results in \(-\frac{6}{\sqrt{14}}\).

4. **Surface Integral**: The surface integral simplifies to integrating over a region in the XY plane. The differential area element \(dS\) is expressed in terms of \(dA\), leading to an integral involving \(\sqrt{14}\).

5. **Region of Integration**: The region \(R\) in the XY plane is defined by bounds on \(X\) and \(Y\): \(0 \leq X \leq 2\) and \(0 \leq Y \leq -\frac{3}{2}X + 3\).

6. **Final Calculation**: After setting up the double integral, errors in calculations are acknowledged and corrected, leading to the final result of \(-18\).

The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of careful calculation to avoid mistakes, ultimately solving the surface integral problem correctly.
