The text describes a problem involving Stokes' theorem, which is used in vector calculus to relate a surface integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface to a line integral around the boundary curve of that surface. The specific problem involves evaluating the line integral \(\oint (y\,dx - 5x\,dy + 3\,dz)\) over a closed curve in three-dimensional space.

Since the problem is in 3-space, Green's theorem isn't applicable; instead, Stokes' theorem is used. The text explains that the orientation of the curve is anti-clockwise when viewed from above (along the positive z-axis), indicating a positive normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \).

The next step involves finding the curl of the vector field \(\mathbf{f} = \langle y, -5x, 3 \rangle\). This is done by computing the determinant of a matrix formed with unit vectors \(\mathbf{i}\), \(\mathbf{j}\), and \(\mathbf{k}\) along with the partial derivatives of \(y\), \(-5x\), and \(3\) concerning \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The resulting curl is found to be \(\langle 0, 0, -6 \rangle\).

The task then requires computing the surface integral of this curl over a specified surface. To find the normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) of the plane defined by the points involved in the curve, vectors between these points are constructed and their cross product is computed to yield an orthogonal vector to the plane.

Finally, using this normal vector and ensuring that it lies on the plane (by confirming a dot product equals zero), one can proceed with applying Stokes' theorem to compute the required surface integral. The specific details for solving the integral itself are not fully described but involve these preliminary steps in setup and calculation.

The text describes the process of solving a surface integral in vector calculus using Stokes' Theorem. Initially, an equation of a plane is derived from linear algebra:

\[ Z = 6 - 3X - 2Y \]

The normal vector \( \mathbf{N} \) to this plane is calculated as \( (3, 2, 1) \), and its norm is \( \sqrt{14} \).

Next, the curl of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is found to be \( (0, 0, -6) \). The dot product of the curl with the normal vector gives:

\[ \frac{-6}{\sqrt{14}} \]

This result is used in evaluating the surface integral over the plane. The differential area element \( dS \) is transformed into \( dA \) on the XY-plane, leading to an integral involving a region defined by the line equation:

\[ Y = -\frac{3}{2}X + 3 \]

The region of integration in the XY-plane extends from \( X = 0 \) to \( X = 2 \), and for each \( X \), \( Y \) ranges from 0 to \(-\frac{3}{2}X + 3\).

After correcting some calculation errors, the integral is evaluated to yield a final result of \(-18\). The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of careful computation in such problems.
