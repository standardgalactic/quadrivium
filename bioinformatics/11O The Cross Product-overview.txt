The text provides an explanation for calculating the area of a parallelogram using vectors and determinants. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Two-Dimensional Vectors**: 
   - In 2D, you can use two vectors \( \mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2) \) and \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2) \).
   - The area of the parallelogram they form is given by the absolute value of the determinant: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = |u_1v_2 - u_2v_1|
     \]

2. **Three-Dimensional Vectors**:
   - In 3D, vectors \( \mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3) \) and \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3) \) are used.
   - The cross product \( \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \) results in a vector perpendicular to both:
     \[
     \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)
     \]
   - The magnitude of this cross product vector gives the area of the parallelogram:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \| \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \|
     \]

3. **Connection Between Vectors and Determinants**:
   - In 2D, the determinant directly gives the area.
   - In 3D, the cross product's magnitude (calculated using determinants) provides the area.

4. **Special Case for Two-Dimensional Vectors in Three Dimensions**:
   - When extending 2D vectors to 3D by adding a zero as the third component, the cross product simplifies, and its z-component gives the area directly.

This explanation highlights how vector operations and determinants are interconnected in calculating geometric properties like areas.

The text provides an explanation for calculating the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors, both in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) spaces. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Two-Dimensional Case**: 
   - In 2D, you can represent two vectors as row vectors \((u_1, u_2)\) and \((v_1, v_2)\).
   - The area of the parallelogram they form is given by the absolute value of the determinant: \(|u_1v_2 - u_2v_1|\).

2. **Three-Dimensional Case**:
   - In 3D, vectors are represented as \((u_1, u_2, u_3)\) and \((v_1, v_2, v_3)\).
   - The cross product of these two vectors results in a third vector that is perpendicular to the original pair.
   - The magnitude (or norm) of this cross product vector equals the area of the parallelogram formed by the original vectors.
   - The cross product can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix with unit vectors \(\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}\) in the first row and the components of the two vectors in the second and third rows.

3. **Connection Between Vectors and Determinants**:
   - In 2D, taking the determinant directly gives the area.
   - In 3D, the cross product provides a vector whose magnitude is the area.
   - The process involves converting 2D vectors to 3D by adding a zero component for calculation purposes, but only the z-component (or relevant non-zero component) contributes to the final area.
