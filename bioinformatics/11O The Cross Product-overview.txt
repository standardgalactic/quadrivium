The text provides an explanation for calculating the area of a parallelogram using vectors and determinants. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Two-Dimensional Vectors**: 
   - In 2D, you can use two vectors \( \mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2) \) and \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2) \).
   - The area of the parallelogram they form is given by the absolute value of the determinant: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = |u_1v_2 - u_2v_1|
     \]

2. **Three-Dimensional Vectors**:
   - In 3D, vectors \( \mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3) \) and \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3) \) are used.
   - The cross product \( \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \) results in a vector perpendicular to both:
     \[
     \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)
     \]
   - The magnitude of this cross product vector gives the area of the parallelogram:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \| \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \|
     \]

3. **Connection Between Vectors and Determinants**:
   - In 2D, the determinant directly gives the area.
   - In 3D, the cross product's magnitude (calculated using determinants) provides the area.

4. **Special Case for Two-Dimensional Vectors in Three Dimensions**:
   - When extending 2D vectors to 3D by adding a zero as the third component, the cross product simplifies, and its z-component gives the area directly.

This explanation highlights how vector operations and determinants are interconnected in calculating geometric properties like areas.
