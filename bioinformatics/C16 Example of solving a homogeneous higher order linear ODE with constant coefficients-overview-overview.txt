The text explains how to solve a linear, homogeneous third-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The key step is using an auxiliary (characteristic) equation given by:

\[ m^3 + 3m^2 + 3m + 1 = 0. \]

This can be simplified as \((m+1)^3 = 0\) through binomial expansion, indicating a triple root at \( m = -1 \). The general solution to the differential equation is then:

\[ y(x) = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2 x e^{-x} + c_3 x^2 e^{-x}, \]

where \( c_1 \), \( c_2 \), and \( c_3 \) are constants determined by initial or boundary conditions. The presence of a triple root leads to terms involving powers of \( x \) multiplied by the exponential function.
