The text discusses how to handle repeated eigenvalues in matrices when solving differential equations. When a real eigenvalue appears more than once (e.g., multiplicity 2 for \( \lambda_1 = -3 \)), two cases arise:

1. **Multiple Eigenvectors**: If multiple linearly independent eigenvectors are found for the repeated eigenvalue, solutions are constructed using these vectors and constants.

2. **Single Eigenvector**: If only one eigenvector is available, generalized eigenvectors are used. Solutions involve functions with powers of \( t \) and factorials in denominators to reflect the eigenvalue's multiplicity. For instance, with a multiplicity of 2, solutions might include terms like \( k e^{\lambda_1 t} \) and \( (pt + k) e^{\lambda_1 t} \). This pattern extends for higher multiplicities.

The text notes that these solutions can be verified by differentiating them and substituting back into the matrix equation \( x' = Ax \), ensuring they align with linear algebra principles.
