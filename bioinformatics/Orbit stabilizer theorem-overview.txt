The text provides an explanation of the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, a fundamental concept in group theory that relates the sizes of orbits and stabilizers within a group. Here's a summary:

1. **Definitions**:
   - **Index**: The index of a subgroup \( A \) (the stabilizer) in a group \( G \) is the number of distinct left cosets of \( A \) in \( G \), denoted as \( |G : A| \).
   - **Orbit**: The orbit of an element \( A \) under a group action is the set of elements that can be reached by applying elements of the group to \( A \).

2. **Theorem Statement**:
   - The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem states that the index of the stabilizer subgroup \( A \) in \( G \) equals the number of elements in the orbit of \( A \). Symbolically, \( |G : A| = |\text{Orbit}(A)| \).

3. **Explanation**:
   - Each element in a coset maps to the same element in the orbit when acting on \( A \).
   - If two elements from different cosets map to the same element in the orbit, it leads to a contradiction because their difference would imply they belong to the same coset.

4. **Proof**:
   - For any element \( g \) in a coset of the stabilizer, acting on \( A \) results in the same element as acting with any other element from that coset.
   - If an element from a different coset maps to the same orbit element, it contradicts the definition of distinct cosets.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The theorem shows a deep connection between group actions and subgroup indices, emphasizing the equivalence in counting elements between cosets and orbit elements.

The text emphasizes understanding through careful reading and revisiting explanations to grasp the significance and implications of the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem.

The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem is an important concept in group theory, relating subgroups (stabilizers) and their cosets to orbits of a set under a group action. Here's a summary:

1. **Definitions:**
   - **Index:** For a subgroup \( H \) of a group \( G \), the index \( |G : H| \) is the number of distinct left cosets of \( H \) in \( G \).
   - **Orbit:** The orbit of an element \( A \) under a group action is the set of elements that can be reached by applying every element of the group to \( A \).

2. **Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem:**
   - States that for a finite group \( G \) acting on a set, the number of distinct cosets of the stabilizer subgroup of an element \( A \) (denoted as \( |G : \text{Stab}(A)| \)) is equal to the number of elements in the orbit of \( A \).

3. **Explanation:**
   - For any two elements in the same coset, applying them to \( A \) results in the same element in the orbit of \( A \). Thus, each coset corresponds uniquely to an element in the orbit.
   - If an element from a different coset were to map to the same element in the orbit as one from another coset, it would imply they are actually in the same coset due to their action on \( A \), leading to a contradiction.

4. **Proof Sketch:**
   - Show that all elements of a given coset map to the same element in the orbit.
   - Assume an element from a different coset maps to the same orbit element, derive a contradiction showing it must actually be in the original coset.
   - Conclude that distinct cosets correspond to distinct elements in the orbit.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The theorem elegantly connects the algebraic structure of group actions (cosets and stabilizers) with geometric or combinatorial properties (orbits), demonstrating that the index of the stabilizer is equal to the size of the orbit. This relationship is profound and requires careful study to fully grasp.
