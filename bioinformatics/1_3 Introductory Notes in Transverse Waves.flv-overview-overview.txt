The text discusses solving problems related to sound waves in pipes by applying concepts of standing waves and resonance. It covers three scenarios involving different pipe configurations:

1. **Closed Pipe (One End Closed):**
   - A 90 cm long pipe closed at one end resonates with a fundamental frequency of 95 Hz.
   - The fundamental standing wave has a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end, making the length equal to \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the wavelength. 
   - Calculating the wavelength: \(\lambda_1 = 3.6\) m.
   - Speed of sound: \(v = 342\) m/s.

2. **Open Pipe (Both Ends Open):**
   - A 60 cm long pipe open at both ends resonates with a fundamental frequency of 3 kHz.
   - The fundamental standing wave has antinodes at both ends, making the length equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the wavelength.
   - Calculating the wavelength: \(\lambda_1 = 1.2\) m.
   - Speed of sound: \(v = 3600\) m/s.

3. **Pipe with One End Open (Different Frequency):**
   - A 90 cm long pipe closed at one end resonates with a first overtone frequency of 285 Hz.
   - The first overtone corresponds to \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the wavelength fitting in the pipe.
   - Calculating the wavelength: \(\lambda_2 = 1.2\) m.
   - Speed of sound: \(v = 342\) m/s.

Understanding how standing waves form under different boundary conditions (open/closed ends) is essential for determining wavelengths and calculating the speed of sound in each scenario.
