The text explains group automorphisms through the example of a cyclic group with three elements. It starts by defining a cyclic subgroup \( C_3 \) composed of permutations: the identity element \( E \), and two others, \( \sigma \) (rotating 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 1) and \( \sigma^2 \) (rotating 1 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 1). A Cayley table is used to show how these permutations combine.

An automorphism is introduced as a bijective mapping that preserves the group operation. One such mapping, \( F \), transforms \( E \to E \), \( \sigma \to \sigma^2 \), and \( \sigma^2 \to \sigma \). The text verifies this mapping maintains the group structure using the Cayley table.

It concludes by noting that automorphisms form a group, denoted as Aut(G), which includes mappings like the identity and another possible automorphism. Each automorphism has an inverse within this set, illustrating the structured nature of group automorphisms in this simple example.
