The text outlines how to solve various physics problems involving electrons and positrons moving through magnetic fields. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Electron Speed**: The velocity of an electron with a given kinetic energy (1.2 keV) is calculated using the formula \(v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}}\), where \(KE\) is the kinetic energy, and \(m\) is the mass of the electron.

2. **Magnetic Field Calculation**: The strength of the magnetic field (\(B\)) is determined from the radius of an electron's path using the equation \(B = \frac{mv}{|q|r}\), where \(r\) is the radius, \(v\) is velocity, and \(q\) is the charge.

3. **Circulating Frequency and Period**: The period (\(T\)) for circular motion is calculated with \(T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}\). The frequency is simply the reciprocal of this period.

4. **Positron in Magnetic Field**:
   - **Period Calculation**: For a positron with kinetic energy (2 keV) moving at an angle, only the perpendicular velocity component affects its circular motion. The period \(T\) is given by \(T = \frac{2\pi m}{|q|B}\).
   - **Pitch Calculation**: The pitch (\(P\)) of a helical path is calculated as \(P = v_{\parallel} \times T\), where \(v_{\parallel} = v \cos(\theta)\) and \(v\) is the total velocity.

5. **Collision Time of Electron-Positron Pair**: When an unknown particle decays into an electron and a positron moving in opposite circular paths, they collide after half their period: \(T/2 = \frac{\pi m}{|q|B}\).

These problems demonstrate the use of fundamental physics equations to analyze motion characteristics of charged particles in magnetic fields.
