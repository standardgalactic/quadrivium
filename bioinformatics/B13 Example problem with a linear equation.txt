Now, I just want to quickly discuss this concept of the error function and the complementary error function.
Now, we can't solve all indefinite integrals. We can't get the antiderivative of e to the power negative x squared or the sine of x squared dx.
And the integrals of these kind are called non-elementary. These are non-elementary integrals.
So, you can't always solve for them. In applied mathematics, we're talking probability, talking statistics.
There are some important functions defined in terms of these non-elementary integrals.
And these are the two that we want to quickly discuss that you have to memorize, the error function in x and the complementary error function in x.
And they are defined as such, the error function 2 over the square root of pi, the definite integral going from 0 to x of e to the power of x.
Pi negative t squared dt. And for the complementary going from x to infinity.
Now, there's some of the solutions that you also, it's nice to be aware of, the error function where x equals infinity.
So, that will go from 0 to infinity of e to the power negative t squared dt.
And you can work that out, that's just going to be the square root of pi over 2.
And if this is the square root of pi over 2, so here we go, this is the square root of pi over 2 times 2 over pi, that just equals 1.
So, that's a simple little calculation.
And what we also need to know though, that the error function plus the complementary error function equals 1.
Okay, so much for the error function, just these few things that you have to be aware of.
Let's try and use it in an example.
