Okay, by now I think you've realized that I've swapped things around. I said first we were going to do this method of using the determinant to get to the inverse and then using the identity matrix. I used the problem with identity matrix, so I'm just going to put these videos in this order.
So once again, remember, here's the linear set, the set of linear equations that I created myself. I created myself because I did one in various x1, x2, x3. Now we can use the method of the determinant. So again, that's my matrix A, which is just the constants of my linear set, my set of linear equations.
And first, I'm going to get the matrix of minors. I'm going to get what we call the matrix of minors. How do we get that? It's a 3x3 matrix and I'm going to end up still with a 3x3 matrix. And all I do is this. If I'm talking about row 1, column 1, I close off row 1 and I close off column 1 and I'm left with this 2x2 matrix and I get its determinant.
2x2 is 4 minus negative 1, so 4 minus 1 is 3. So I'm in row 1, column 2, I close row 1, I close column 2 and what I have left is, I close row 1, I close column 2, so I'm left with these 2.
So 2 times 2 is 4 minus minus 1, that's 5. That's 5, yes. Now for position in row 1 and column 3, I close row 1, I close column 3 and I'm left with negative 2.
negative 2 is negative 2. Negative 2 is negative 4. Okay, so I'm with row 2, column 1. I close row 2, column 1. I'm left with 2 times 2 is 4.
4 minus 3 is 4. Am I right? It's 3, 5, negative 4 is 1, of course. So I'm closing off row 2, column 2, row 2, column 2. So it's 2 minus 3.
That's 5, that's 5, that's 5. Now row 2, column 3, row 2, column 3. Negative 1, negative 2 is negative 3.
3, 3, 1. Close row 3, column 1. So it's negative 2. Negative 2. And then positive 6 is 4. And I'm just going to write it's 4, 5, and negative 2. Just do the same.
So that is called the matrix of minus. So it's the determinant of the 2 by 2 matrix of what gets left if you eliminate the row and column of the row and column position.
that you're looking for. It's not that difficult. Now we're going to go for the matrix of cofactors. Matrix of cofactors.
And that's very simple. We're going to multiply by positive 1, negative 1, each individual element in the following manner.
We'll start always with multiplying by positive 1. If that's a positive, all the way around it is going to be a negative.
So it's going to be positive 1, negative 1, positive 1, negative 1, positive 1. So it's not negatives all the way around. Sorry.
That'll also be a negative. So it's positive 1, negative 1, positive 1, negative 1, positive 1, negative 1, positive 1, negative 1, positive 1.
So we just alternate. And we're only dealing with square matrices. So nothing until what's going to happen.
Okay. So 3 times positive 1 is 3. 5 times negative 1 is negative 5. Negative 4 plus 1 is negative 4.
That'll be negative 1, 5, 3, positive again, negative, positive.
And that is my matrix of cofactors. My matrix of cofactors. Let me see. If I'm right, 3, negative 5, negative 4, negative 5, negative 3, 4, negative 5, negative 2.
Okay. That's my matrix of cofactors. So all I did was I just had this other matrix called positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive.
And I just multiplied. And I just multiplied as 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Okay.
And I just multiplied that by each individual element in the same position. Okay.
And I get my matrix of cofactors. Now I need to get my determinant.
And it says very easily the determinant of A, whichever way you want to write it, the determinant of A equals.
All I have to do is pick one row from here and one row from here or one column from there, one column from there, as long as it's the same column.
Okay. So if I pick column 1, I've got to pick column 1. If I pick row 3, I've got to pick row 3 of my matrix and my matrix of cofactors.
And I'm going to choose the one that has the most zeros. Unfortunately, I have nothing. The reason being, let's choose, what did I choose there?
I think I chose 4, 3, 3 and 1. Doesn't matter. Let's choose whatever we want. Let's choose column 1, column 1.
And all I'm going to be left with, I'm going to call that A11. So it's row 1, column 1. So I've got to choose row 1, column 1.
And we call that big capital C because it's cofactors. So 2, 1, element. I'm going to row 2, 1. So it's going to be C2, 1 as well.
And then row 3, 3, 1. That's going to be column 3, 1. Okay.
So if I had chosen this row, it would be A21, A22, A23. So that would have to be C21, row 2, column 1, C, row 2, column 2, C, row 3, column 3.
So these elements just have to correspond. And you can choose any row or column as long as it's the same in both.
Okay. Let's do A1, C1, 1. 3 times 1 is 3. Plus row 2, row 2. That's going to give us a negative 2.
3. 1 times 4 is positive 4. That equals a 5. Okay.
So that's how you get the determinant by using the matrix of cofactors.
So I'm going to take my original matrix, my matrix of cofactors, and then I'm going to choose a row or column, multiply them out, and add individuals.
Okay. So that is, no matter which ones you choose here, which ones you choose here, it doesn't matter.
Okay. Just by the by, that's another way to decide whether this becomes a positive or negative.
If you just look at row and column 11, 1 and 1, 1 plus 1 is 2.
If it's an even number, just adding one column, one row, that gives me a 2 twist even, so this stays multiplied by a positive 1.
Okay. 2 plus 1, 2 plus 1 is 3.
So row 2, row 2, column 1, this 1 became a negative 1.
Because 2 plus 1 is 3. That's odd.
And all the odds get multiplied by negative 1.
So this is another way of doing it.
Okay. And you'll see when I discuss the determinant that you don't go through all of this.
You go through all of this to get, to specifically get the inverse.
Okay. If you just want the determinant, you don't have to go through this a lot and watch the following videos on the determinant, you'll see the shortcut.
Okay. But I want to do the, get the full inverse.
Okay. So my determinant is 5.
Okay.
My determinant is 5.
And now I've got an equation which says that the inverse equals 1 over the determinant, 1 over the determinant times the adjoint of A.
So I still need the adjoint of A.
Adjoint of A.
And this is the fancy extra term which you have to learn because it's nothing other than it's anonymous with transpose.
Okay.
But it's not the transpose then of A.
It's the transpose of the cofactors, matrix of cofactors.
Okay. That's why we give it another term, adjoint of A.
That is A, but you're taking the transpose of this one.
So that will become 3, negative 5, negative 4.
So this first row becomes the first column.
Negative 1, 5, and 3.
And 4, and negative 5, and negative 2.
Okay.
So I'm going to multiply this by 1 over 5.
Remember, 5 was my determinant.
And what do I get?
Lo and behold.
Look at the previous video set where I used the identity to get this.
I'm going to get exactly the same inverse.
And as much as I'm going to get 3 over 5, negative 1 over 5, 4 over 5, I'm going to get negative 1.
We need 1.
We need negative 1.
We need negative 4 over 5.
Number 3 over 5, and negative 2 over 5, negative 2 over 5.
Again, that's my A inverse.
Let's multiply it by B.
B was negative 5, 4, and 6.
And do that.
Negative 3, negative 5, so that'll be negative 3.
That'll be negative 4 over 5, plus 4 over 5, plus 24 over 5.
And I bet you if you do that, you're going to get, what did we choose?
1, 3, and 4.
Please do that.
Row by column, row by column, row by column, row by column, and you're getting 1, 3, and 4, 1, 3, and 4.
Exactly what we wanted.
So either method of getting to A inverse you can use.
This one's obviously a bit shorter.
And now we know exactly where we stand.
Now I can go ahead with other videos, I think, and tell you more about the determinant.
About the determinant.
As I said, it's very difficult to decide in what order to put these videos in.
So you've got to watch all of them because you need one for the other, you need the other for the other.
But this is all about getting the inverse so that I can use the fact that A inverse times B is going to give you the column vector x, which is all your armistice.
