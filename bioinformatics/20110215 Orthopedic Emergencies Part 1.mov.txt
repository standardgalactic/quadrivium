It actually sounded first very easy and then actually just realized it's quite hard because
it's a very broad topic and it's a field that few people have interest in and even fewer people
actually get to work in and it quickly become a very specialized field that's outside the
management scope even of most hospitals not just of most doctors but the people tend to forget
that orthopedics is a daily occurrence it happens every day and most people you're going to get
around to be exposed to orthopedics mostly the interns have to work in casualty mostly and
probably going to end up in a casualty setting and as a surgical registrar you're always in casualty
and being asked advice so I decided rather to go for orthopedics in casualty discussing the general
diagnostic approach first line management and a few common fractures a bit of classification which
I'll discuss later as well as shoulder dislocation and examination of the hand especially in light
of nerve and tendon injuries the general diagnostic approach for orthopedics are quite simple and
quite logical firstly it's the history most people will present with the history of trauma if trauma is
not witnessed common occurrence that mothers came in said the child's not using the arms a loss of
function is also very important one to ask about as well as the mechanism of injury with mechanism of
injury you can actually already start to to focus on the on the joint on the area you need to examine
further as well as what type of injury you can expect an examination would be the next step to
express especially to look for deformity for any swelling or also for the position of comfort you
would notice that in the hip fracture we discussed later as a typical position when the shoulder dislocation
the patient will be supporting his arm it will be slightly internal rotate and you will not want to move that at all
also feel for any tenderness especially pointedness of a specific area of the bone or the joint as
well as reduce the range of motion also should give you an idea of an injury that's underlying and
always to check your neurovascular status of an affected limb distal pulses as well as capillary
and sensation and the next step is usually go for x-rays x-rays always evaluate with the rule of twos
get two views of the affected area you're looking at get two limbs x-rays as well especially in
children because since they have lots of open growth plates and even people with lots of
experience can get lost between all the lines and if you're still confused get two people to look at
the x-rays also important to include both joints above and distal and proximal to the fracture since a
lot of the fractures actually especially in the lower leg for example the fracture at the ankle can
extend to just below the knee the fracture of the fibula head which is easily missed as well but
does influence your management in decision-making process so it's the two views two limbs two joints and two
people watching and if you go a little further some people say two different occasions especially
if you don't see a fracture on the first time the first line management of any fracturing entry is
pain control for a patient pain control with analgesia especially a paracetamol opioids of the
first line of choice and NSAIDs are not a bad choice in the acute setting though a prolonged use of NSAIDs
does cause a delayed inflammatory reaction which actually can cause a delayed union as well
immobilization is important part is also part of the pain control and a backslab is the way to go
in casualty and size is the key a backslab that should be long enough to include both joints and
not just the wrist just not to stop the mid arm but include the elbow as well it should be broad
enough cast used as a specific for the limb not a lower leg with the small six inch plastic use and it
also should be thick enough so the patient don't bend it and you walk around with a piece of paper after
a day or two should be thick enough strong enough to support the limb immobilize completely and a
collar and cuff if any upper limbs is also necessary any dislocations should be reduced as soon as
possible and I know it's not always in your in your expertise to do it immediately but the longer
you wait the more difficult it gets especially a day or two later shoulder dislocation I believe
is chronic shoulder dislocation after 48 hours already and you're likely going for internal of open
reduction and then I mean the fixation due to failed close reduction becomes more and more prominent
the longer you wait and then there's always the big question if the structures are going to measure
conservatively or the open reduction internal fixation but I'll get to that in a moment and there's
also always the referral the most people tend to use classifications and I know orthopedic surgeons are
the biggest culprits in that the problem of classification is not everybody has quite a grasp of it and so
you might be talking about a section five of double plateau fracture and you've got your idea what
it is but the guy on the other end of the line he's got a different idea so you miss each other
completely so it's always better to describe the fracture as well the site where it's located which
bone is involved where in the bone is involved if it's midshaft metathesis or epithesis epithesis yes
that's it it's intra extra articular and if it's displaced undisplaced angulation as well and if it's
comminuted and of course if it's open or closed it's also important the common fractures I would
like to discuss are just the ones you will be seeing casualty distal radius of the forearm around the
hip and the ankle as well as the Salter-Harris fractures of children now the classical one I've
actually used classifications here just to show how easy it is to confuse them the first one is the
is a college fracture it's an extra articular fracture it's dorsally displaced usually and
the radial deviated with apex as volar angulated classical side one is the one at the bottom
you can see it is dorsally displaced and it's angulated volarly the mechanism of the injury is
usually in elderly ladies or any elderly person filling an ostrac's hand and they will present
with a swollen distal radius wrist unable to move it and deformity can be quite prominent as well
now the rule for the management of course be your first line management and after that it's either
conservative or for open reduction until fixation and for that we use the rule of 11 a little bit
adapted the main thing that's your concerns about the angle of your articular surface of the distal
radius especially on the lateral view on the bottom it's not the best picture but you measure
a line along the shaft compared to a line across the particular surface and that should be ideally
11 degrees in a forward tilt anything up to neutral is acceptable as soon as it's tilted or backwards
like the one of the previous let me just quickly go two back see both of them that one and the one at the top
are grossly tilted dorsally would need open reduction fixation or even close reduction pairwise also needed
on the api you look for shortening from the base of the ulna as well as to the tip of the radial
steloid should be at least 12 to 11 millimeters long and the angle of the radial distal radius
forms as well should be 22 degrees so the rule of 11 would be 11 degrees forward 11 millimeters in
length and 11 to double that 22 degrees for the radius and steroid I think this one's just to
share the confusion this can be easily confused the smith with the collies fracture which is
in fact called the smith fracture it's exact opposite of pose fracture with your bowler displacement
dorsal angulation and it's also without falling outstretched hand but also a different different
management same ones the next ones of barton structure it's an interarticular fracture of the
distal radius also of the fallen and distal hand and they classify towards dorsal or volar and all of
them would get bariffed fractures of the forearms the mechanism of injury are usually for an
austral arm as well as also defense fractures people get assault and trying to protect the face of the
body in casualty it would be a backslab above elbow backslab though the previous ones with distal radius
you can get away with a forearm backslab and analgesia and you should always be in mind for other
injuries that's related to the fracture radial head injuries as well as montegra and gallihazzi fractures
which we'll discuss in a moment the question if it's all conservative management or for open
reduction to fixation would be in adults all isolated radius and ulnar fractures gets the
general fixation the reason for that is is that it gets if they get shortening especially and the
reduction is not that well held in a cast and given problems later with the rest and function the
only exception is isolated on the fracture with undisplaced usually before the nightstick injury
someone would be of direct trauma to the ulnar children are a little bit of a different story
they are conservative management for isolated fractures as well as on and radius fracture
especially if it's in a good position if it's angulated or displaced next there would be a closed
reduction and then a k-wise to hold it or either a plate as well and montegra and gallihazzi fractures
are always for a lot of montegra and gallihazzi fractures are always for a lot of montegra fracture is
