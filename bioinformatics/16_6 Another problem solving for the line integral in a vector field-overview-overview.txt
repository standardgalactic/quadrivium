The text provides an analysis of evaluating line integrals for a specific vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)\) along different paths from point \(A(0, 0)\) to point \(B(1, 1)\). It explores whether these integrals are path-independent by calculating them for two specific paths and then considering any other possible path.

### Analysis of Paths:

1. **Straight Line Path** (\((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\)):
   - Parameterization: \(x = t\), \(y = t\) with \(t\) ranging from 0 to 1.
   - The line integral evaluates to \(\frac{4}{3}\).

2. **Parabolic Path** (\(y = x^2\)):
   - Parameterization: \(x = t\), \(y = t^2\) with \(t\) ranging from 0 to 1.
   - The line integral also evaluates to \(\frac{4}{3}\).

### Conclusion:

The same result of \(\frac{4}{3}\) for different paths suggests that the vector field is conservative and path-independent. This means there exists a potential function \(f(x, y)\) such that \(\nabla f = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)\).

### Potential Function:

The text finds the potential function to be:
\[ 
f(x, y) = \frac{x^3}{3} + xy^2 + C 
\]
where \(C\) is a constant. By evaluating this function at points \((1, 1)\) and \((0, 0)\), it confirms that the line integral from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\) is indeed \(\frac{4}{3}\).

### Significance:

This analysis highlights a key property of conservative vector fields: the value of the line integral between two points depends only on those endpoints and not on the path taken. This characteristic implies conservation properties in physical systems, such as potential energy remaining constant regardless of the path traveled within certain constraints.
