Now we're going to talk about the composition of functions
and what we're going to compose is
these type of functions, so for instance if n is 2, f of x comma y
and the vector function on the other side
and here I have an example where n is also equal to 2
so I have the f of x of y equals y times e to the power x
and the vector r in time
in this instance of the cosine of t comma the sine of t
Now I can compose those two functions, remember
I can compose those two functions as such
and the function of t
and what this boils to basically is the chain rule
Now, what if I want the derivative of this?
So I've got these two functions and I want the first derivative of this
What will I do?
Remember, if I have a function like this
and I take the composition
at a certain point that is going to give me a single value
So the derivative had better at a certain point also give me a single value
and in this instance it's going to be a value of t
It's with respect to t
And there are two methods to do this
If what I said now doesn't make much sense
is let's just do the composition of these functions
and I want the first derivative with respect to time
Let's look at method 1 and method 2
Method 1
Method 1
is an equation that we're going to use
and we're just going to set as the gradient of f
gradient of f
evaluated at this vector function
and with that the dot product
of the first derivative of that vector function
Now we know that a dot product gives us a single value answer
so we are on the right track
That's method 1
So first of all, let's get the gradient
but remember as always we get the gradient of f
that is original
that's without putting a value in
without putting a value in
So that gradient is
first let's do the partial derivative with respect to x
that means y is a constant
e to the power x remains that
so it's going to be y e to the power x
comma
now x is a
for the second derivative
partial derivative
x is a constant
so it's only y
so that's going to leave me
e to the power x
remember that is y to the power 1
I bring that forward
this becomes 0
so I'm left with that
now we evaluate it at this value
so that's something new
the gradient of f at
this vector
is going to equal
so all I'm going to do now
the y I'm going to replace with
sine of t
and all the x's I'm going to replace with
cosine of t
so I'm left with
sine of t
times e to the power of cosine t
comma
e to the power x
x is the cosine of t
okay
so look
clearly what I've done is
first
I've just gotten the normal gradient
of my function
originally
and then I plug this
there's my gradient now
and then I plug in these values for x and y
okay
because I'm making a composition of these two functions
and now
we just need
r prime of t
that's very easy
remember we just do each individually
so that's going to be
negative sine of t
comma
cosine of t
and now I just need the dot product
I just need the dot product of these two
so that's going to be
sine of t
e to the power of cosine t
times that
so that will leave me with
minus
sine square of t
times
e to the power of cosine t
and plus
cosine of t
e to the power of cosine t
as simple as that
so I won't prove how these methods
how these methods are derived
or prove them in any way
show how they derive
or prove them
but that is method one
so it's the gradient of f
once you get the gradient
at this
vector
dot product with the first derivative
the other one usually uses
something that might be familiar to you
in the form of a chain rule
and then it's this way
we're going to have it
it's simply going to be
the sum of
let's say
i equals one to n
of
di f
di x i
times
dot product with
or just multiply
di x i d t
di x i d t
as simple as that
okay
that's our method number two
and that is
you wouldn't recognize that
simply as the chain rule
so let's do that
so let's
i equal one
so this is going to be
the first partial derivative
of f
so what is the first partial derivative
y is a constant
so that is going to be
y e to the power x
remains the same
times
it's not a dot product
it goes
times
dx dt
dx
our first one
remember this is my value of x
so that is
negative the sine of t
so that's my first
summation here
plus the second one
so di f
di x2
x2 remember is y
so y is
x is now the constant
that's e to the power x
times
and the y dt
remember
this is my y value
so that's cosine of t
cosine of t
now I simply just have to replace
my y's and x's
so where am I left with
y is the sine of t
and that sine of t
so it's negative sine squared of t
e to the power of cosine of t
plus cosine of t
e to the power of x is cosine of t
and we see that it's exactly the same
exactly the same
so here we're just applying the channel
and here we're basically applying it as well
but through a different method
using the gradient
okay so that is how you get the derivative
of the composition of a function
and that's why I said
it ends up being a certain number
if t equals pi over 2
then pi over 2
pi over 2
pi over 2
pi over 2
I'm going to replace it
and I'm left with a single value
and that is what I mean by this composition
is going to leave me
at a certain point
with a certain single
with a certain single value
let's get some examples done
here I have f of x of y
equals x squared plus y squared
and then the vector r equals 1 minus 1 over t
and 1 plus 1 over t
in case you can't read there
and I want this
the combination of f and r
its first derivative at t equals 1
the t equals 1
so what do we need?
first of all
we need the gradient of f
let's do that
at x comma y
it stands for x comma y
that is going to equal
2x comma 2y
now let's get that
very same gradient
but we have it at
this vector r
so for every x
I'm going to use
1 minus 1 over t
for every y
1 plus 1 over t
so that's going to be
2 minus 2 over t
comma 2 plus 2 over t
that is that
just substituting values
for x and y
because I'm getting
the combination of these two
and then we need the
first derivative
of the r of t there
and which is easy
that is going to be
minus 1
that is 1 over t squared
1 over t squared
comma
the first derivative
of that is going to be
minus 1 over t squared
minus 1 over t squared
and now I need to get
the dot product
of these two
so there's going to be
this multiplied by this
plus this multiplied by that
so that is going to leave me
if I multiply this out
that's 2 over t squared
minus 2 over t
to the power of 3
plus that
that's the negative
negative 2 over t squared
and a negative
where am I now
where am I now
this multiplied by that
and a negative 2
over t to the power of 3
those two will go
so I'm left with
I'm left with negative 4
over t to the power of 3
but I need to evaluate that
at t equals 1
so that answer is going to be
negative
that answer is going to be
negative 4
to the power of 3
I see it
there is no
I have Tu
