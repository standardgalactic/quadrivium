The text introduces the concept of a "subgraph" in graph theory. A subgraph is defined as a portion of a larger graph that consists of a subset of its vertices and edges. The original graph itself qualifies as a subgraph, which may seem counterintuitive but is valid.

To illustrate this concept, the author uses Mathematica to demonstrate how to create and visualize subgraphs. They begin by constructing a complete graph with 10 nodes (vertices) using Mathematicaâ€™s variable naming conventions and commands. A "complete graph" implies that every node is directly connected to every other node, establishing adjacency among all vertices.

Next, they introduce another computer variable, G1 (G sub 1), representing a subgraph of the original complete graph. This new subgraph includes only four specific nodes (vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4) along with the edges connecting these nodes within the larger graph. The `subgraph` keyword in Mathematica helps extract this subset.

The author uses the `highlightGraph` function to visually distinguish the subgraph from the original graph by applying a "thick" highlight style to its vertices. This visual aid helps users clearly see how the smaller subgraph fits within the context of the complete graph.

Finally, the text encourages experimentation with different graphs and subgraphs using various graphical styles in Mathematica, promoting an interactive learning experience.
