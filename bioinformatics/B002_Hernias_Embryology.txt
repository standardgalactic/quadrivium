Now we continue our look into hernias and in this very short lecture a quick word on embryology.
Now hernias can develop in any part of the abdominal wall and with all the organs and the size of the wall
this obviously affects a large area and you'd actually have to look at the embryology of each section and each organ
to make any kind of sense of this and I really refer you to textbooks on the embryology if you're more interested in this.
Most important because we do see inguinal hernias and ventral hernias as the most common is the development of the urogenital tract.
I'm specifically thinking of the development of the inguinal canal and then the anterior abdominal wall
due to the lateral and superior inferior folding as the little fetus develops in the anterior abdominal wall hernias itself.
So you can see there's a bar only up to level 1 so it's not very important information.
knowledge to have this embryology but if you are interested in it please read a textbook on this.
