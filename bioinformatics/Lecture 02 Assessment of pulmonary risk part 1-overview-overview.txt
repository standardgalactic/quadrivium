The text outlines strategies for assessing patients with respiratory diseases like asthma or COPD before surgery to minimize postoperative complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. Unlike cardiac assessments, which follow structured guidelines, pulmonary evaluations focus more on risk assessment due to limited research. Key risk factors include age, existing COPD, smoking, congestive heart failure, functional status, ASA class, type and duration of surgery, recent weight loss, long-term steroid or alcohol use, and clinical history.

In emergency surgeries, immediate action is necessary without preoperative tests. However, non-emergent cases with uncontrolled symptoms or deviations from baseline require further investigation. The recommended investigations are spirometry and chest X-rays, though their ability to predict postoperative outcomes is limited. Spirometry helps in diagnosing lung conditions and monitoring therapy, while chest X-rays are commonly performed despite minimal evidence of impacting management decisions or patient outcomes. Further discussion on obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be covered later.
