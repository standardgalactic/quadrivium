This script demonstrates how to use Plotly's `create_distplot` function to visualize distributions of two datasets: female salaries and male salaries. The process involves several steps, including setting up the data, creating the distribution plot, customizing colors and other features, and modifying layout details.

Here is a breakdown of the script:

1. **Setup Data**:
   - Create lists for `hist_data` that contain salary values from two sub-dataframes: one for females and one for males.
   - Define `group_labels` to distinguish between the female and male salary distributions.

2. **Create Basic Distribution Plot**:
   - Use `create_distplot` to plot histograms with rug plots and kernel density estimates (KDEs) for both datasets.

3. **Customize Colors**:
   - Modify the colors of the distribution plot using RGB values, setting different shades for male and female distributions.
   - Adjust opacity to allow some overlap visibility between the two distributions.

4. **Change Curve Type**:
   - Switch from KDE to a normal distribution curve by changing the `curve_type` argument to `'normal'`.

5. **Modify Layout**:
   - Update plot layout using `fig.update_layout`, setting the title and customizing axis properties.
   - Optionally, hide specific components like histograms or rug plots.

6. **Axis Customization**:
   - Adjust the x-axis domain to focus on a specific salary range (e.g., $1,000 to $5,000).

This tutorial highlights Plotly's flexibility in creating and customizing distribution plots, making it easy to visualize and compare datasets effectively.
