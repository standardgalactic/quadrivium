The text outlines solving a non-homogeneous first-order linear differential equation with \( P(x) = -3 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). The solution involves using an integrating factor, \( e^{-3x} \), to simplify the equation. Here are the key steps:

1. Multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor.
2. Recognize the left side as the derivative of a product, allowing it to be rewritten in terms of derivatives.
3. Integrate both sides with respect to \( x \) using substitution (\( u = -3x \)).
4. Solve for \( y \), yielding the solution \( y = -2 + 6e^{3x} + Ce^{3x} \).

The general solution combines a particular solution, \( y_p = -2 + 6e^{3x} \), and a homogeneous solution, \( y_h = Ce^{3x} \). The constant \( C \) represents the family of solutions for the associated homogeneous equation.
