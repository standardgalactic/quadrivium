so a little bit more about this course you're going to find a textbook attached to these lectures
please download the textbook and use it as a reference I'm not going to go exactly according
to the textbook because I want to build a whole rich environment of resources for you now we're
going to start with a beautiful example I want to show you now this is very tongue-in-cheek actually
I want to show you how we can use limits in the life sciences and I hope that little example grabs
you to show you how interesting this is then we're going to go step by step by step to how to build
your knowledge in the use of limits and by the end you'll see it's very fascinating and it's actually
very easy to see right at the end though we're going to do it on a computer algebra system I'll
take you quickly through how to install the system on your computer and run you through the basics of
how to do this mathematics right in your computer you know write a few lines of code push a button
you're going to get the answer it is fantastic
