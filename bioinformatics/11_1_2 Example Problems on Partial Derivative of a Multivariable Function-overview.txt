The text describes how to find the first partial derivative with respect to \( x \) for a function defined by two different expressions depending on whether the variables \( (x, y) \) are at the origin or not. If \( (x, y) \neq (0, 0) \), the function is given by \( \frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2} \). For \( (x, y) = (0, 0) \), it's just a constant value of 0.

To find the partial derivative with respect to \( x \) when \( (x, y) \neq (0, 0) \), we use the quotient rule. We let:

- \( u = xy \) and hence \( u' = y \) because \( y \) is treated as a constant.
- \( v = x^2 + y^2 \) and hence \( v' = 2x \).

Applying the quotient rule, \((u'v - uv') / v^2\), gives:

\[ \frac{(y)(x^2 + y^2) - (xy)(2x)}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} \]

Simplifying this expression results in:

\[ \frac{x^2y + y^3 - 2x^2y}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = \frac{y^3 - x^2y}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} \]

For the case when \( (x, y) = (0, 0) \), the partial derivative of a constant (0) with respect to \( x \) is straightforwardly 0. This result can also be verified using first principles by evaluating the limit as \( h \to 0 \) for the difference quotient:

\[ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(0+h, 0) - f(0, 0)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{0 - 0}{h} = 0 \]

Thus, the partial derivative with respect to \( x \) for the entire function is piecewise: 

- For \( (x, y) \neq (0, 0) \), it's \(\frac{y^3 - x^2y}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}\).
- At \( (x, y) = (0, 0) \), it is 0.

The text discusses how to find the first partial derivative with respect to \( x \) for a function defined in two parts. The function depends on variables \( x \) and \( y \), and behaves differently when both variables are zero compared to other values.

1. **For \( (x, y) \neq (0, 0) \):**
   - The expression involves the term \( \frac{x^2y + y^3}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} \).
   - To find its partial derivative with respect to \( x \), the quotient rule is used:
     - Let \( u = x^2y + y^3 \) and \( v = (x^2 + y^2)^2 \).
     - The derivatives are \( u' = 2xy \) (since \( y \) is treated as a constant) and \( v' = 4x(x^2 + y^2) \).
   - Applying the quotient rule: 
     \[
     \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} = \frac{(2xy)(x^2 + y^2)^2 - (x^2y + y^3)(4x(x^2 + y^2))}{(x^2 + y^2)^4}
     \]
   - Simplifying this expression results in:
     \[
     \frac{x^2y - 2x^2y + y^3}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = \frac{-x^2y + y^3}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}
     \]

2. **For \( (x, y) = (0, 0) \):**
   - The function is constant and equal to zero.
   - The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) of a constant is zero.

Overall, the task involves calculating these derivatives separately for each part of the piecewise-defined function.
