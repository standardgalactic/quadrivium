The text describes solving a Cauchy-Euler equation, which is a linear, homogeneous differential equation with non-constant coefficients. The solution involves assuming a form \( y = x^m \). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to a characteristic polynomial: \( m^2 - m - 2 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic yields roots \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = 2 \). Consequently, the general solution is \( y = c_1 x^{-1} + c_2 x^2 \), where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. This method efficiently utilizes the equation's structure to find solutions.
