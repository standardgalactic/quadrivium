The text outlines the method of variation of parameters for solving systems of non-homogeneous linear differential equations. This technique is used when the method of undetermined coefficients is ineffective. The process involves several key steps:

1. **Preliminary Work**: Begin by determining the complementary solution of the homogeneous system \(x' = Ax\) by setting \(f(t) = 0\).

2. **Fundamental Matrix**: Construct a fundamental matrix \(\Phi(t)\), an n-by-n matrix composed of solutions to the homogeneous system, each represented as eigenvectors scaled by exponentials involving their corresponding eigenvalues.

3. **Solution Structure**:
   - Solutions are expressed in terms of linear combinations of the form \(x = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \ldots + c_nx_n\), where each \(x_i\) is a solution to the homogeneous system.
   - These solutions can be arranged into matrix form, with \(\Phi(t)\) having columns corresponding to individual solutions.

4. **Properties**:
   - The determinant of \(\Phi(t)\), known as the Wronskian, must be non-zero for \(\Phi(t)\) to be invertible.
   - The fundamental matrix satisfies the differential equation \(\Phi'(t) = A\Phi(t)\).

5. **Variation of Parameters**: To find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous system, use \(\Phi(t)c\), where \(c\) is a function of \(t\). Solve for \(c\) using the relationship \(\Phi'(t)c + \Phi(t)c' = g(t)\), with \(g(t)\) representing the non-homogeneous component.

This method systematically utilizes the fundamental matrix to derive a particular solution, integrating it into the broader framework of solving differential equations.
