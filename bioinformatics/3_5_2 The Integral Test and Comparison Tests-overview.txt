Let's break down your explanation of series convergence, specifically focusing on the \(p\)-series and the use of the integral test. 

### Overview

1. **Series Definition**: A series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) consists of terms \(a_k\) summed from some starting index (here \(k = 1\)) to infinity.

2. **Partial Sums and Remainder**:
   - A partial sum, \(S_n\), is the sum of the first \(n\) terms: \(\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k\).
   - The remainder \(R_n\) after \(n\) terms is given by: 
     \[
     R_n = \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} a_k
     \]
   This represents the sum of all terms from \(n+1\) to infinity.

### Integral Test

The integral test provides a method to determine the convergence or divergence of a series by comparing it to an improper integral. Here are the conditions for applying the integral test:

1. **Function Representation**: The terms of the series must be representable as a function, \(f(x)\), such that \(f(k) = a_k\) for all integers \(k\).

2. **Continuity**: The function \(f(x)\) should be continuous on \([1, \infty)\).

3. **Monotonicity**: The function \(f(x)\) must be decreasing for all \(x \geq 1\).

4. **Positivity**: The function \(f(x)\) must be positive for all \(x \geq 1\).

### Applying the Integral Test

- If the improper integral \(\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx\) converges (i.e., evaluates to a finite number), then the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) also converges.
  
- Conversely, if the integral diverges (i.e., is infinite), so does the series.

### \(p\)-Series

A specific example of this test is applied to the \(p\)-series:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^p}
\]

- **Convergence**: The \(p\)-series converges if \(p > 1\).
  
- **Divergence**: It diverges for \(p \leq 1\). For \(p = 1\), it is the harmonic series, which also diverges.

### Conclusion

The integral test is a powerful tool in analyzing series convergence by linking them to integrals. The conditions ensure that the comparison between the discrete sum and the continuous integral is valid. This method simplifies understanding whether an infinite series converges or not by transforming the problem into one involving calculus, specifically integration.

The text discusses a method for determining whether an infinite series converges or diverges using the integral test. The process involves comparing a series \(\sum f(k)\) with an improper integral \(\int f(x) \, dx\). If both the series and the integral converge (or diverge), then their behaviors are linked.

To apply this method, one must ensure that \(f(x)\) is continuous, positive, and decreasing for all \(x \geq 1\). This allows for setting up an inequality involving the remainder of the series. Specifically, if the improper integral from \(n\) to infinity converges, it can be used to establish bounds on the remainder term of the series beyond the nth term.

The key points are:
- Use the integral test by comparing \(\sum f(k)\) and \(\int_1^\infty f(x) \, dx\).
- Ensure \(f(x)\) is continuous, positive, and decreasing for \(x \geq 1\).
- If \(\int_n^\infty f(x) \, dx\) converges, then the remainder of the series from the nth term onward is bounded between zero and this integral.
- This method helps determine both convergence/divergence of the series and estimate the error (remainder) when truncating the series.

You've described a classic application of the Integral Test, which is often used to determine the convergence of infinite series. Let's break down what you're referring to:

### The P-Series

The p-series is defined as:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^p} \]

- **Convergence:** This series converges if \( p > 1 \) and diverges if \( p \leq 1 \).
- **Harmonic Series:** When \( p = 1 \), it becomes the harmonic series, which is known to diverge.

### Integral Test

The Integral Test provides a method for determining the convergence or divergence of a series by comparing it to an improper integral. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Function Definition**: Define a function \( f(x) \) such that \( f(k) = a_k \) for all positive integers \( k \). For the p-series, this would be \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^p} \).

2. **Conditions**:
   - \( f(x) \) must be continuous for \( x \geq 1 \).
   - \( f(x) \) must be positive for \( x \geq 1 \).
   - \( f(x) \) must be decreasing for \( x \geq 1 \).

3. **Integral Comparison**:
   - Evaluate the improper integral \( \int_1^{\infty} f(x) \, dx \).
   - If this integral converges, then the series \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k \) also converges.
   - If the integral diverges, then the series diverges.

### Application to the P-Series

For the p-series:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{x^p} \]

- **Integral**: 
  \[
  \int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx
  \]
  - This integral converges if \( p > 1 \) and diverges if \( p \leq 1 \).

### Remainder Estimate

The remainder of the series after summing the first \( n \) terms can be estimated using integrals:

- **Remainder**: 
  \[
  R_n = \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} a_k
  \]

- **Integral Bounds**:
  - If \( f(x) \) is decreasing, then:
    \[
    \int_{n+1}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx < R_n < \int_n^{\infty} f(x) \, dx
    \]

This provides bounds for the remainder, allowing you to estimate how close the partial sum is to the actual value of the infinite series.

### Conclusion

The Integral Test is a powerful tool for analyzing series, especially when dealing with functions that are easy to integrate. It not only helps determine convergence but also provides insights into the behavior of the remainder term in a series.

The text discusses how one can determine whether a series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} f(k)\) converges or diverges by using the integral test. According to this method, if \(f(x)\) is continuous, positive, and decreasing for all \(x \geq 1\), then the convergence of the improper integral \(\int_1^{\infty} f(x) \, dx\) implies the convergence of the series, and its divergence implies the divergence of the series.

Additionally, if the series converges, one can estimate the remainder (or error) after summing the first \(n\) terms using integrals. Specifically, for a convergent series, the remainder \(R_n = \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} f(k)\) is bounded by:

\[ 0 \leq R_n \leq \int_n^{\infty} f(x) \, dx \]

Thus, by evaluating the integral from \(n\) to infinity of \(f(x)\), one can establish bounds for the remainder when approximating the series with its first \(n\) terms. This provides a way to estimate how close the partial sum is to the actual value of the infinite series.
