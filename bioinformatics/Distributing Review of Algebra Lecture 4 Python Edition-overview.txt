negative three, not \(A\) raised to \(-1\) and then cubed (which would be \((-A)^3\)). So let’s use parentheses: \(A^{(-3)}\).

Next, we want to distribute this into an expression involving both \(B\) and \(A\). The expression is \(B + A^2\).

Let's see how the distribution works:

1. **Expression Setup**: We have \(5 \times A^{-3} \times (B + A^2)\).
   
2. **Distribute**:
   - Distribute \(5 \times A^{-3}\) across each term inside the parentheses.
   - This gives us: 
     \[
     5A^{-3} \cdot B + 5A^{-3} \cdot A^2
     \]

3. **Simplify Each Term**:
   - For the first term, \(5A^{-3} \cdot B\), it remains as is because there’s no like base to combine: 
     \[
     5B \cdot A^{-3}
     \]
   
   - For the second term, simplify using the laws of exponents (\(a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}\)):
     \[
     5A^{-3} \cdot A^2 = 5A^{-1}
     \]

4. **Final Expression**:
   - The simplified expression is: 
     \[
     5B \cdot A^{-3} + 5A^{-1}
     \]
   
5. **Interpretation of Negative Exponents**:
   - Recall that \(A^{-n} = \frac{1}{A^n}\), so:
     - \(5B \cdot A^{-3} = \frac{5B}{A^3}\)
     - \(5A^{-1} = \frac{5}{A}\)

Thus, the fully expanded and simplified expression is:

\[
\frac{5B}{A^3} + \frac{5}{A}
\]

This completes the distribution and simplification using symbolic computation.

It looks like you're exploring symbolic computation with square roots, particularly focusing on cases involving non-negative and negative numbers using a Python library like SymPy. Here’s how you can address your examples in code:

1. **Non-negative Symbols:**

   ```python
   from sympy import symbols, sqrt

   # Define symbols as positive for the purpose of this computation
   x, y = symbols('x y', positive=True)

   # Example 1: Distribute square roots over a product
   expr1 = sqrt(x * y**3) + sqrt(x**5 * y)
   expanded_expr1 = expr1.expand()
   print(expanded_expr1)
   ```

   In this code, `expand()` is used to distribute the square roots across products since both `x` and `y` are defined as positive symbols.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers:**

   ```python
   from sympy import I

   # Redefine x, y without positivity constraint for negative values
   x, y = symbols('x y')

   # Example 2: Show that sqrt(x) * sqrt(y) != sqrt(xy) for negative x and y
   expr2 = sqrt(-1) * sqrt(-1)
   print(expr2)

   combined_expr = sqrt((-1) * (-1))
   print(combined_expr)
   ```

   Here, `sqrt(-1)` is interpreted as the imaginary unit `I` in SymPy. The first expression evaluates to `-1`, demonstrating that \(\sqrt{-1} \times \sqrt{-1} \neq \sqrt{(-1) \times (-1)}\).

3. **Explanation of Results:**

   - When dealing with non-negative numbers, the property \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}\) holds.
   - For negative numbers, this property does not hold in the real number system because the square root of a negative number is not defined within reals. Instead, it leads to imaginary numbers.

4. **Complex Numbers:**

   If you want to handle complex numbers explicitly:

   ```python
   from sympy import I

   # Using complex numbers
   expr_complex = sqrt(-1) * sqrt(-1)
   print(expr_complex)  # Outputs -1, since sqrt(-1) is I and I*I = -1
   ```

This code demonstrates how to handle symbolic square roots in Python using SymPy, especially when dealing with non-negative and negative numbers. It highlights the importance of constraints on symbols (like positivity) and shows how these affect mathematical operations such as distributing square roots.

It looks like you've been exploring the power of SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, to simplify algebraic expressions such as polynomials and expand terms involving radicals or powers.

Here's a concise breakdown of what you've done:

1. **Symbol Definition**: You used `symbols` from SymPy to define variables (e.g., `x`, `a`, `b`) with specific properties, like being real numbers. By default, if no keyword arguments are specified, they're considered real.

2. **Expression Expansion**: With `.expand()`, you efficiently expanded algebraic expressions:
   - Products of binomials and trinomials were expanded into polynomials.
   - Powers of sums (like \((a + b)^3\)) were expanded using the binomial theorem, revealing coefficients from Pascal's triangle.

3. **Handling Radicals**: You emphasized careful handling when distributing across radicals, as rules for operations can vary depending on whether numbers are positive or negative. Testing with specific values can help verify correctness in these edge cases.

4. **Benefits of SymPy**:
   - **Automation and Accuracy**: Automates tedious algebraic expansions accurately.
   - **Visualization**: Provides a clear, readable format similar to textbook representations.
   - **Verification**: Allows for quick verification by substituting numbers to check the validity of symbolic manipulations.

Overall, using SymPy can significantly streamline algebraic manipulation tasks, reduce errors, and save time compared to manual calculations. If you have any specific questions or need further examples, feel free to ask!
