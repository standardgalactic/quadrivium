The text describes two physics problems involving wave properties on strings.

1. **Wave Speed and Resonant Frequency on a String:**
   - A string is 125 cm (or 1.25 meters) long with a mass of 2 grams (0.002 kg). It is under tension of 7 newtons.
   - The goal is to find the wave speed and the lowest resonant frequency.
   - Using the formula for wave speed \( v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \), where \( T \) is the tension and \( \mu \) (linear mass density) is mass per unit length (\(\mu = \frac{m}{l}\)), we calculate:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{0.002 \, \text{kg}}{1.25 \, \text{m}} = 0.0016 \, \text{kg/m}
     \]
     \[
     v = \sqrt{\frac{7}{0.0016}} \approx 66.1 \, \text{m/s}
     \]
   - The lowest resonant frequency (first harmonic) is found using \( f_1 = \frac{v}{2l} \):
     \[
     f_1 = \frac{66.1}{2 \times 1.25} \approx 26.5 \, \text{Hz}
     \]

2. **Wavelength of Interfering Waves:**
   - Two sinusoidal waves with identical wavelengths and amplitudes travel in opposite directions at 10 cm/s (0.1 m/s).
   - The string is flat every half-second.
   - This indicates that a full wavelength corresponds to one second, as the time for the wave to return to being flat (node-to-node) is half a second.
   - Therefore, the period \( T \) is 1 second, and frequency \( f = \frac{1}{T} = 1 \, \text{Hz} \).
   - Using \( v = f \lambda \), we find:
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{0.1}{1} = 0.1 \, \text{m}
     \]

Both problems are solved using wave equations and properties of standing waves.
