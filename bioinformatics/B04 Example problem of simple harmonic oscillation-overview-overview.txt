The text provides a method for solving differential equations related to oscillatory motion using an auxiliary equation. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Setup**: The problem begins by setting \( x = 0 \) and defining constants: the spring constant \( k = 8 \) and mass \( m = 2 \, \text{kg} \). This leads to an auxiliary equation with roots that describe oscillation: \( m^2 + 4 = 0 \).

2. **Roots**: Solving for \( m \), we find complex roots \( m_1 = 2i \) and \( m_2 = -2i \), indicating oscillatory motion, characterized by sine and cosine functions.

3. **General Solution**: The position function is given by:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 \cos(2t) + c_2 \sin(2t)
   \]
   where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants determined by initial conditions.

4. **Alternative Form**: The solution can also be expressed as:
   \[
   x(t) = A \cos(2t - \phi)
   \]
   with amplitude \( A \) and phase angle \( \phi \), derived from initial conditions.

5. **Amplitude and Phase**:
   - Amplitude \( A \): 
     \[
     A = \sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2}
     \]
   - Phase angle \( \phi \):
     \[
     \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{c_2}{c_1}\right)
     \]

6. **Special Cases**: If \( c_2 = 0 \), the motion starts from rest at maximum or minimum displacement.

7. **Caution with Phase Angle**: When calculating \( \phi \), ensure the correct quadrant is considered, especially for negative values of \( c_1 \) and/or \( c_2 \).

The text also discusses calculating the phase angle \(\phi\) using trigonometric functions in oscillatory motion contexts. It emphasizes caution to avoid errors, particularly when determining \(\phi\) as \(\pi - \tan^{-1}(1)\). This method facilitates analyzing simple harmonic motion by linking initial conditions with characteristics like amplitude and phase.
