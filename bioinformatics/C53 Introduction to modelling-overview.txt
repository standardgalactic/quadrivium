The section discusses applying previously learned techniques to solve various physical problems using differential equations as mathematical models. The focus will be on linear differential equations, typically second-order with constant coefficients, where the dependent variable is often represented as \( y(t) \), \( x'(t) \), or \( x''(t) \). These equations can model different systems such as springs and electrical circuits, differing only in terminology and physical interpretation. The discussion will cover linear models involving initial value problems, boundary value problems, and provide a brief overview of some non-linear models.

The text outlines an exploration of physical problems using mathematical techniques learned in previous chapters, specifically focusing on differential equations as models. These equations are typically linear, up to second order, involving constant coefficients, and functions of time (t). The discussion will cover various models that can be explained by such equations, emphasizing their application across different contexts like springs and electrical circuitsâ€”where only the terminology and interpretation vary but not the fundamental mathematical structure.

The text plans to examine:

1. Linear models with initial value problems.
2. Linear models with boundary value problems.
3. A brief look at some non-linear models.

This approach aims to demonstrate how similar mathematical frameworks can be applied across different physical scenarios.
