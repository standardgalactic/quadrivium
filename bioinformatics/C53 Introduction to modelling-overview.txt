The section discusses applying previously learned techniques to solve various physical problems using differential equations as mathematical models. The focus will be on linear differential equations, typically second-order with constant coefficients, where the dependent variable is often represented as \( y(t) \), \( x'(t) \), or \( x''(t) \). These equations can model different systems such as springs and electrical circuits, differing only in terminology and physical interpretation. The discussion will cover linear models involving initial value problems, boundary value problems, and provide a brief overview of some non-linear models.
