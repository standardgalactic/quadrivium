Let's have a look then at this initial value problem.
We have y double prime minus 4y prime
minus 5y equals 0 and the y of 1 equals 0
and the y prime of 1 equals 2.
Clearly it's a linear second order
ordinary differential equation of the
homogeneous type. Constant coefficients.
So we're going to make use here of
the auxiliary equation and we can write
that down quite easily. That's going to be
m squared minus 4m minus 5 equals 0
and as far as the roots are concerned
it's obviously going to be m minus 5
and the m plus 1. 0 in other words
m sub 1 is going to be negative 1
m sub 2 equals 5 or the other way around
it doesn't really matter. In other words y is going to be
c sub 1 e to the power negative x plus c sub 2 e to the power
5x for m sub 1 and m sub 2.
Now that this is an initial value problem
so we can plug in these values
so for y we're going to plug in 0
c1 e to the power negative
for x we're going to plug in 1
plus c2 e to the power 5
for x we plug in 1 again.
So if we just scramble this up again
we're going to have the fact that c1 over e
is going to equal negative c2 e to the power 5
multiply both sides by e. In other words
c1 is going to be negative c2 e to the power 6
e to the power 6
So we can rewrite this equation as
y equals now for c1
we're going to put in negative c2
e to the power 6
so that's the c1 part
and then e to the power negative x
plus c2 e to the power
5x
that should be x of course
So we have this equation
we can simplify that as
we can bring out the c2
as a constant factor
so we're left with
for instance
let's have it e to the power
5x minus
e to the power
6 minus x
If we get the first derivative of this
it's going to be c2
5 e to the power 5x
plus e to the power 6 minus x
That's e to the power 6 minus x
and through the chain rule
we're also going to differentiate this
which is a negative 1 brought forward
negative 1 times this negative is positive
so there we go
but we have the substitution
so we can say 2 equals
c2
and we're 5
e to the power 5
with the 1 substitution there
plus another e to the power 6 minus 1 is 5
in other words
2 equals
c2 times
6
e to the power 5
and c2
in other words
it's going to be a third
e to the power
e to the power 5
e to the power 5
e to the power 5
and
let's have a look
let's just have a look
and make sure we didn't make a mistake
anyway
of course
we have the fact that we
let's just have a quick look
of course
of course to the power negative 5
it's being this
on this side
and that leaves c1
as a negative c2
so c2
negative c2
would be negative 1 third
e to the power negative 5
times e to the power 6
from this
in other words
c1 equals
negative 1 third
e
negative 1 third e
so I know what c1 is
and I know what c2 now is
I know what c2 now is
now let's substitute this
into our original equation here
in other words
y is going to be equal
c1 as negative 1 third e
times e to the power negative x
plus c2 is going to be a third
e to the power negative 5
negative 5 times
e to the power 5x
let's clean this up a bit
so we're going to have
negative 1 third here
e to the power 1 minus x
there
we're going to have a third
e to the power
we can take out 5
and we're going to have
here x minus
x minus 1
now it's cost me to clear
this up a bit further even
so let's just have
do this first
a third
e to the power 5
and we have x minus 1
minus another third
e to the power negative
x minus 1
just so that we have
these two terminals the same
I just brought out a
in this term I just brought
a negative out
which leaves me with
x minus 1
x minus 2
to the power
e to the power
to the power
we can take it
let's get it
so that we have
a negative celeb
with x minus 1
and we have
e to the power
x minus 2
so that we have
a negative
or x minus 2
and we can take it
from 1
to the power
and then we have
that'sPs
that we have
to keep it
so that this
happens
and I want
to keep it
right
so that we have
