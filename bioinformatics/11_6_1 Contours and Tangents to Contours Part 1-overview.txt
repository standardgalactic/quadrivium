The text discusses the concept of contours for a multivariable function and explains how they relate to gradients. A contour represents a curve (or surface in higher dimensions) where the function has a constant value, providing a way to visualize aspects of a function that would otherwise be difficult to perceive.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function Description**: The example uses a simple multivariable function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \). This is a 2-variable (x and y) to 1-variable (z) function where the graph of this function in three-dimensional space forms a parabolic surface.

2. **Contours**: Contours are created by fixing the output value (z-value), which results in level curves on the x-y plane. For \( z = c \), this leads to an equation like \( x^2 + y^2 = c \). In this example, with circular contours being typical for functions of this form, setting \( z = 8 \) gives a circle defined by \( x^2 + y^2 = 8 \).

3. **Contour Visualization**: The text describes the visualization process where a plane (at a fixed value of z) intersects the surface. This intersection is projected onto the x-y plane, showing a contour line.

4. **Gradient Concept**: The gradient vector \( \nabla f(x, y) = 2x, 2y \) represents the direction and rate of steepest ascent of the function at any point (x, y). At the specific point (2, 2), this gives a gradient vector of (4, 4).

5. **Gradient Interpretation**: The text explains that the gradient is perpendicular to the contour line at a given point. This means that at the point (2, 2) on the contour \( x^2 + y^2 = 8 \), the gradient points in the direction where the function increases most rapidly.

Overall, the text uses a simple example to illustrate how contours and gradients help understand multivariable functions by reducing complex three-dimensional surfaces into more interpretable two-dimensional representations.

The text explains concepts related to vectors, gradients, and contours in multivariable calculus. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Vectors**: A vector described as "4, 4" originates from (0,0) but can be positioned anywhere without changing its properties. Vectors remain consistent regardless of their position.

2. **Gradient Vector**: The gradient of a multivariable function is a vector that is perpendicular to the tangent line of the contour at any given point on the graph. Contours are curves or surfaces that represent constant values of the function.

3. **Contour and Space**:
   - In 2D space (x, y), contours are lines.
   - In 3D space (x, y, z), contours become surfaces, while the graph itself exists in four-dimensional space if it includes an additional variable.

4. **Perpendicularity**: The gradient vector is perpendicular to the contour at a point, not necessarily to other elements like tangent planes of three-dimensional graphs.

5. **Applications and Linear Algebra**: Understanding gradients involves using dot products from linear algebra, where the dot product of two perpendicular vectors is zero. This concept helps in deriving equations for tangent lines or planes in multivariable calculus.

Overall, the text emphasizes understanding how gradients relate to contours and the importance of linear algebra concepts in multivariable calculus.

The text explains how contours and tangents work in different dimensional spaces. It describes a scenario where a three-dimensional curve exists within four-dimensional space. In this context, the contour of the graph is two-dimensional, and its tangent is a line. When considering a specific point on this surface (P = 1,1,1), we seek to find the equation for a tangent plane to the contour in three-dimensional space.

The text emphasizes distinguishing between the tangent to the contour and any tangent hyperplane related to the original four-dimensional curve, as they are different concepts. The necessary steps involve calculating the gradient of a function F at the point P, which gives us a vector perpendicular to the surface. In this example, with partial derivatives yielding 2x, 2y, and 2z, evaluating them at (1,1,1) results in the gradient vector (2,2,2). This vector will be used to find the equation of the tangent plane to the contour at that point. The text concludes by noting the importance not to confuse different types of tangents when working with multidimensional geometry.

The text describes how to find the equation of a tangent plane to a contour in multivariable calculus. It starts with constructing vectors from given points in different dimensional spaces, noting that having two points provides a vector. The focus is on a three-space contour curve, where one constructs a perpendicular vector and another along a specific plane. By taking the dot product of these vectors and setting it to zero (because they are perpendicular), an equation for the tangent plane can be derived.

In this case, after some calculations, the equation \( x + y + z = 3 \) is found as the tangent plane at a specific point on the contour. The text emphasizes understanding the difference between a contour plot and its graph, highlighting how local linearization techniques are used to derive tangent equations. The process involves using gradients and dot products to find equations for tangents to curves or planes in higher-dimensional spaces.

The text discusses using a vector constructed from a given point and an arbitrary point, along with the gradient of a function \( f \) at that specific point. The dot product of this vector and the gradient gives information about the tangent. Specifically, it helps identify the tangent to the curve at the given point on the graph of the function. However, it's important to distinguish between the tangent to the surface (graph) and other potential tangents, as they are different concepts in this context.
