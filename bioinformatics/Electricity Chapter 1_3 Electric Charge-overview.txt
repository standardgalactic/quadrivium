The text provides a series of physics problems related to electrostatic forces and Coulomb's law. Here’s a summary:

1. **Problem with Two Identical Charged Particles:**
   - Two particles with identical positive charges repel each other.
   - They are initially 3.2 x 10^-3 meters apart.
   - The first particle has a known mass and accelerates at 7 m/s², while the second accelerates at 9 m/s².
   - By equating the forces (Newton's third law) and using \( F = ma \), the mass of the second particle is calculated as \( 4.9 \times 10^{-7} \) kg.
   - Using Coulomb’s law, the charge on each particle is determined to be \( 7.1 \times 10^{-11} \) C.

2. **Maximizing Electrostatic Force:**
   - A sphere with charge \( Q \) gives off charge \( q \) to another sphere.
   - To maximize electrostatic force, the ratio \( q/Q \) should be 0.5.

3. **Electrostatic Equilibrium of Three Particles:**
   - Particle 1 has a positive charge and particle 2 a negative charge, placed 0.1 meters apart.
   - The task is to find where an unknown charge \( q_3 \) can be placed for electrostatic equilibrium.
   - Analysis shows that regardless of the sign of \( q_3 \), static equilibrium is possible only on the negative x-axis.
   - Using Coulomb’s law, the distances involved are squared, so signs don't affect magnitude calculations. The equilibrium position depends on balancing forces from both charges.

These problems illustrate applications of Newton's laws and Coulomb's law in determining masses, charges, and positions for equilibrium in systems of charged particles.

The text discusses how to determine the position where a third charge \( q_3 \) must be placed on the negative x-axis so that it remains in electrostatic equilibrium with two other charges, \( q1 \) and \( q2 \). The key point is that the forces exerted by \( q1 \) and \( q2 \) on \( q3 \) need to balance each other out. This requires setting up an equation where the magnitudes of these electrostatic forces are equal.

The relevant equations involve Coulomb's law, with the distances between the charges being crucial. It is noted that by canceling common terms (such as the electrostatic constant and \( q3 \)), a simple algebraic solution shows that \( x \), the position for \( q3 \) on the negative x-axis, comes out to approximately -0.14 meters.

The main takeaway is that regardless of the specific value or sign of \( q3 \)'s charge, it must be placed at this calculated position to maintain equilibrium. This solution highlights how understanding distances and force balance in electrostatic systems can lead to predictable outcomes for charge positioning.

The text discusses several problems related to electrostatics, focusing on forces between charged particles. Here's a summary:

1. **Problem of Two Identically Charged Particles:**
   - Two positively charged particles are separated by \(3.2 \times 10^{-3}\) meters.
   - They experience repulsive forces due to their identical charges (Newton’s third law).
   - Given the masses and accelerations of both particles, you can calculate the mass of the second particle using the formula \( F = ma \). The ratio of masses is equal to the inverse ratio of their accelerations because the forces are equal.
   - The charge on each particle can be determined by equating Coulomb's law (\( F = k \frac{q^2}{r^2} \)) with Newton’s second law (\( F = ma \)), using known values for mass and acceleration.

2. **Maximizing Electrostatic Force:**
   - For two spheres where one sphere gives charge \( q \) to another, the ratio of charges that maximizes the electrostatic force between them is 0.5.
   - This is because the product of two numbers with a constant sum (like \( q + q' = q_{\text{total}} \)) is maximized when they are equal.

3. **Electrostatic Equilibrium:**
   - Two particles with charges are placed 0.1 meters apart, and you need to find where a third charge (\( q_3 \)) should be placed for equilibrium.
   - Depending on whether \( q_3 \) is positive or negative, it can only achieve equilibrium on the negative x-axis due to the forces exerted by the other two charges.
   - Coulomb’s law helps determine this position by balancing the attractive and repulsive forces between the charges.

Overall, the text emphasizes using Newton's laws of motion, Coulomb's law, and algebraic manipulation to solve problems involving electrostatic forces and equilibrium.

The text discusses solving a problem involving electrostatic forces to achieve static equilibrium. It explains that two charges exert equal magnitudes of force on a third charge, \( q_3 \), such that these forces balance each other out along the negative x-axis. This requires setting up equations for the electrostatic forces and simplifying them by canceling common terms like the electrostatic constant \( k \) and \( q_3 \). Through algebraic manipulation, it is determined that the position of \( q_3 \), specifically at approximately -0.14 meters on the x-axis, will result in static equilibrium. The distance between \( q_3 \) and another charge \( q_2 \) is given by \( (x - l)^2 \). Importantly, this solution does not depend on the specific value of the charge \( q_3 \), only its position relative to the other charges.
