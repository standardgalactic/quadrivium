To find the distance between parallel planes using a point-plane distance formula, let's break down the steps using your example and correct some details. 

### Distance Between a Point and a Plane

The formula for the distance \( D \) from a point \( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \) to a plane given by the equation \( Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 \) is:

\[
D = \frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0 + D|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}
\]

### Example: Point and Plane

1. **Plane Equation**: \( 2x - 3y - 6z + 1 = 0 \)
   - Here, \( A = 2 \), \( B = -3 \), \( C = -6 \), \( D = 1 \).

2. **Point**: \( (1, -4, -18) \)

3. **Calculate Distance**:
   \[
   D = \frac{|2(1) + (-3)(-4) + (-6)(-18) + 1|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2 + (-6)^2}}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{|2 + 12 + 108 + 1|}{\sqrt{4 + 9 + 36}}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{|123|}{\sqrt{49}} = \frac{123}{7} = 17.57
   \]

### Distance Between Two Parallel Planes

For two parallel planes \( Ax + By + Cz + D_1 = 0 \) and \( Ax + By + Cz + D_2 = 0 \), the distance between them is:

\[
D = \frac{|D_2 - D_1|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}
\]

### Example: Two Parallel Planes

1. **Plane Equations**:
   - Plane 1: \( x + 2y - 2z = 0 \) (or \( x + 2y - 2z + 0 = 0 \))
     - Here, \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2 \), \( C = -2 \), \( D_1 = 0 \).

   - Plane 2: \( 2x + 4y - 4z - 7 = 0 \)
     - Simplify to the same normal vector as Plane 1: Divide by 2.
     - Resulting equation: \( x + 2y - 2z - \frac{7}{2} = 0 \)
     - Here, \( D_2 = -\frac{7}{2} \).

2. **Calculate Distance**:
   \[
   D = \frac{\left|-\frac{7}{2} - 0\right|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + (-2)^2}}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{\frac{7}{2}}{\sqrt{1 + 4 + 4}}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{\frac{7}{2}}{\sqrt{9}} = \frac{\frac{7}{2}}{3} = \frac{7}{6}
   \]

Thus, the distance between the two parallel planes is \( \frac{7}{6} \).

To find the distance between parallel planes and a point and a plane, we use specific formulas. Let's break down the process using your examples:

### Distance Between Two Parallel Planes

Given two parallel planes:
1. \( ax + by + cz = d_1 \)
2. \( ax + by + cz = d_2 \)

The distance \( D \) between these planes is given by:

\[
D = \frac{|d_2 - d_1|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}
\]

**Example:**

For the planes:
- Plane 1: \( x + 2y - 2z = 1 \)
- Plane 2: \( 2x + 4y - 4z = 3 \)

First, confirm they are parallel by checking if their normal vectors are proportional. The normal vector of Plane 1 is \( (1, 2, -2) \), and for Plane 2 it's \( (2, 4, -4) \). Since \( (2, 4, -4) = 2(1, 2, -2) \), they are parallel.

Convert Plane 2 to the same form as Plane 1:
- Divide by 2: \( x + 2y - 2z = \frac{3}{2} \)

Now apply the formula:
\[
D = \frac{\left|\frac{3}{2} - 1\right|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + (-2)^2}} = \frac{\left|\frac{1}{2}\right|}{\sqrt{9}} = \frac{1/2}{3} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

### Distance Between a Point and a Plane

Given a plane:
- \( ax + by + cz = d \)

And a point \( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \), the distance \( D \) from the point to the plane is:

\[
D = \frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 - d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}
\]

**Example:**

For the plane:
- \( 2x - 3y + 6z = 1 \)

And the point \( (1, 0, 0) \):

Calculate using the formula:
\[
D = \frac{|2(1) - 3(0) + 6(0) - 1|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2 + 6^2}} = \frac{|2 - 1|}{\sqrt{4 + 9 + 36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{49}} = \frac{1}{7}
\]

### General Steps

1. **Identify the normal vector** of the plane(s) from their coefficients.
2. **Ensure parallelism** for two planes by checking if their normal vectors are proportional.
3. **Convert to general form** if necessary (i.e., \( ax + by + cz = d \)).
4. **Use the appropriate formula** based on whether you're finding the distance between planes or a point and a plane.

By following these steps, you can solve similar problems involving distances in 3D geometry.
