In the introduction to a research course, participants are informed about what they will receive: video lectures, detailed documentation accessible on various devices or as printed material, and computer files along with raw data for hands-on experience. The initial lecture involves reading Chapter One of the documentation, which outlines the course objectives, identifies the target audience, and emphasizes the importance of the course. Participants are encouraged to complete this reading before proceeding to subsequent lectures.
