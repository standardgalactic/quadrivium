The text discusses the concept of momentum and pressure generated by electromagnetic waves, such as light. It explains that even though these waves do not require a medium and are massless (when viewed as photons), they can still impart momentum to objects. This is demonstrated through the change in energy per unit speed of light (\(c\)).

The derivation starts with Maxwell's relationship that links changes in energy and momentum for electromagnetic waves, expressed as \( \Delta p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} \). If an object completely absorbs the wave, this equation applies directly. However, if it reflects the wave fully back, the change in momentum doubles: \( \Delta p = \frac{2\Delta E}{c} \).

The text also connects this to classical mechanics concepts where force is related to changes in momentum over time (\( F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \)). Using intensity (\( I \)), defined as energy per unit time per unit area, the change in energy can be expressed as \( \Delta E = I A \Delta T \).

From here, the force exerted by the wave is derived:
- For total absorption: \( F = \frac{I A}{c} \)
- For total reflection: \( F = \frac{2I A}{c} \)

The pressure (\( P \)) is then calculated as force per unit area. Thus, for electromagnetic waves:
- Total absorption pressure: \( P = \frac{I}{c} \)
- Total reflection pressure: \( P = \frac{2I}{c} \)

These equations indicate that while the forces and pressures exerted by light are generally very small (due to division by the large speed of light), they can be significant under specific conditions.
