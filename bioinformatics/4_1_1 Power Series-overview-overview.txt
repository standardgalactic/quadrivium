The text explains power series in mathematics, focusing on their expression as sums of terms involving powers of \( (x - c) \), where \( c \) is a constant. The key aspect discussed is the convergence of these series, crucial for applications like Maclaurin and Taylor expansions.

A specific example involves a geometric series with the condition for convergence being \( |x - 2| < 1 \). In this case, when expressed as \( x - 2 \), it converges to \( \frac{1}{3-x} \) for \( x \) between 1 and 3. Power series are powerful because they can approximate complex functions within their radius of convergence by calculating partial sums.

The text highlights the importance of tests for convergence, such as the ratio test, which is used to determine where a series converges by examining limits of consecutive terms. An example given involves a power series with terms \(\frac{k}{3^{k+1}} x^k\). Applying the ratio test simplifies to checking if \( \left| \frac{x}{3} \right| < 1 \), resulting in a radius of convergence of 3, meaning the series converges for \( -3 < x < 3 \).

While the ratio test helps establish this general domain, it does not address behavior at boundary points (\( x = -3 \) and \( x = 3 \)). These require separate checks to determine if the series also converges or diverges at those endpoints. Thus, understanding power series convergence is essential for approximating functions effectively within their domains.
