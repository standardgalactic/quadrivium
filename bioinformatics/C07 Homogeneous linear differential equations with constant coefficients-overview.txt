The text describes methods for solving first-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. It starts by introducing the equation \( ay' + by = 0 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and \( y \) is the dependent variable.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Exponential Solution**: The solution involves finding an exponential function whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself, leading to \( y = e^{mx} \). By substituting into the differential equation, it's shown that \( am + b = 0 \), giving \( m = -\frac{b}{a} \).

2. **Example**: For the specific equation \( 2y' + 5y = 0 \), with \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 5 \), it follows that \( m = -\frac{5}{2} \). Thus, the solution is \( y = Ce^{-\frac{5}{2}x} \).

3. **Alternative Methods**:
   - **Separation of Variables**: Rearrange to \( \frac{1}{y} dy = -\frac{5}{2} dx \), integrate both sides, and solve for \( y \).
   - **Integrating Factor**: Rewrite in standard form \( y' + \frac{5}{2}y = 0 \) and find the integrating factor \( e^{\frac{5}{2}x} \). Multiply through by this factor to simplify and integrate.

4. **Conclusion**: All methods yield the same solution, demonstrating consistency across different techniques for solving first-order linear differential equations.

The text concludes by suggesting that understanding these methods paves the way for tackling higher-order linear differential equations.

The text discusses methods for solving first-order homogeneous linear differential equations with constant coefficients. It begins by introducing a basic form of such an equation, where the function \( y \) is equal to zero on the right-hand side and involves constants \( a \) and \( b \). The key focus is identifying functions whose derivatives are constant multiples of themselves, leading to the exponential function \( e^{mx} \).

The solution for these equations is derived by substituting \( y = e^{mx} \) into the differential equation, resulting in an algebraic equation \( am + b = 0 \). Solving this gives a specific value for \( m \), where \( m = -b/a \). Consequently, \( y = Ce^{mx} \) (where \( C \) is any constant) forms the general solution.

The text provides an example with the differential equation \( 2y' + 5y = 0 \). Here, it calculates \( m = -\frac{5}{2} \), leading to the solution \( y = Ce^{-\frac{5}{2}x} \).

Additionally, two other methods for solving first-order equations are explored:
1. **Separation of Variables**: Rearranging and integrating both sides separately.
2. **Integrating Factor**: Multiplying through by an integrating factor derived from the equationâ€™s standard form.

The text concludes by suggesting that these techniques can be extended to second-order linear differential equations, although it does not elaborate further on this extension within the provided content.
