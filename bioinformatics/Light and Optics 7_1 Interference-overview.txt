The text explains how to understand light interference by shifting from geometric optics, which deals with rays, to considering the wave properties of light. It introduces Huygens' Principle as a key concept for understanding refraction. According to this principle, every point on a wavefront acts as a source of spherical waves that propagate at the same speed within a given medium. By drawing tangent lines from these spherical waves, we can determine new positions of the wavefronts.

The discussion then moves to refraction, where light transitions from one medium with a lower refractive index (N1) to another with a higher refractive index (N2). The text explains that this bending towards the normal happens because the speed of light changes between different media. Huygens' Principle helps visualize how wavefronts change during this transition.

Using geometric considerations, it derives Snell's Law: \( N_1 \sin(\theta_1) = N_2 \sin(\theta_2) \), where \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) are the angles of incidence and refraction relative to the normal. The explanation emphasizes that light can be understood as a wave, allowing us to explain phenomena like refraction through changes in wavelength and speed across different media.

The text discusses how light travels through different media, focusing on changes in speed and wavelength while maintaining the same frequency. The key points are:

1. **Wavefronts and Time Consistency**: As light moves from one point to another at a certain velocity, it maintains consistent travel time across different segments.

2. **Wavelength and Velocity Relationship**: In transitioning between media, light's wavelength changes (λ₁ in medium one becomes λ₂ in medium two), but the ratio of these wavelengths equals the ratio of velocities in each medium (V₁/V₂).

3. **Snell's Law Derivation**: Using trigonometry, it demonstrates Snell’s law: \(\sin(\theta_1) / \sin(\theta_2) = N_2 / N_1\), where \(N\) is the refractive index. This relationship shows how light bends towards the normal when moving from a lower to a higher refractive index medium.

4. **Refractive Index and Speed**: The refractive index (N) is defined as the speed of light in vacuum divided by its speed in the medium, leading to the conclusion that velocity decreases as the refractive index increases.

5. **Principle of Refraction**: As light enters a denser medium (higher refractive index), it slows down and bends towards the normal, resulting in a shorter wavelength but unchanged frequency. This principle underscores the constant nature of light’s frequency across different media.

The text discusses Weyden's principle, which states that every point on a wavefront acts as an individual source for a spherical or circular distribution of waves in two dimensions. This means each point radiates waves outward, contributing to the formation of a circular wavefront. As a result, this method allows the wave to cover a longer distance within the same time period, \( T \), compared to other methods. Essentially, it describes how wave propagation can be extended over greater distances by considering each point on the wavefront as its own source of spherical waves.
