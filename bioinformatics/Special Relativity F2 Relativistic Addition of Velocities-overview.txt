To solve these problems involving relativistic velocity addition and length contraction, let's break down each scenario step by step:

### Problem 1: Relative Velocity of Enterprise 2 with Respect to Earth

Given:
- Enterprise 1 moves away from Earth at \( V_{BE} = 0.65C \).
- Enterprise 2 moves relative to Enterprise 1 at \( V_{CE} = 0.31C \).

We want the velocity of Enterprise 2 relative to Earth (\( V_{AE} \)).

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
\[
V_{AE} = \frac{V_{BE} + V_{CE}}{1 + \frac{V_{BE} \cdot V_{CE}}{C^2}}
\]

Substitute the given values:
\[
V_{AE} = \frac{0.65C + 0.31C}{1 + \frac{(0.65C)(0.31C)}{C^2}}
\]
\[
V_{AE} = \frac{0.96C}{1 + 0.2015}
\]
\[
V_{AE} = \frac{0.96C}{1.2015} \approx 0.799C
\]

So, the velocity of Enterprise 2 relative to Earth is approximately \( 0.8C \).

### Problem 2: Length Contraction of Spacecraft

Given:
- Each spacecraft has a rest length (\( L_0 \)) of 1.5 km.
- Spacecraft A travels at \( V_A = 0.85C \).
- Spacecraft B travels at \( V_B = 0.50C \).

We need to find the length of each ship as measured from the other.

First, calculate the relative velocity (\( V_{AB} \)) using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
\[
V_{AB} = \frac{V_A - V_B}{1 - \frac{V_A \cdot V_B}{C^2}}
\]

Substitute the given values:
\[
V_{AB} = \frac{0.85C - 0.50C}{1 - \frac{(0.85C)(0.50C)}{C^2}}
\]
\[
V_{AB} = \frac{0.35C}{1 - 0.425}
\]
\[
V_{AB} = \frac{0.35C}{0.575} \approx 0.6096C
\]

Now, use the length contraction formula:
\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{V^2}{C^2}}
\]

For Spacecraft A as seen from B:
\[
L_A = 1.5 \text{ km} \times \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{0.6096C}{C}\right)^2}
\]
\[
L_A = 1.5 \text{ km} \times \sqrt{1 - 0.3717}
\]
\[
L_A = 1.5 \text{ km} \times \sqrt{0.6283}
\]
\[
L_A \approx 1.5 \text{ km} \times 0.7926 \approx 1.189 \text{ km}
\]

Similarly, for Spacecraft B as seen from A:
\[
L_B = 1.5 \text{ km} \times \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{0.6096C}{C}\right)^2}
\]
\[
L_B \approx 1.189 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, each spacecraft measures the other to be approximately 1.189 km in length.

The text appears to be a summary of calculations related to special relativity, specifically concerning relative velocities and relativistic momentum between objects in motion:

1. **Relative Velocity Between Spacecraft**:
   - Two spacecraft are moving relative to Earth with given velocities (VAB at 0.850C and VCB at 0.500C).
   - The goal is to find the velocity of one spacecraft as observed from the other (VAC).
   - Using relativistic velocity addition formulas, \( V_{AC} = \frac{V_{CB} - V_{AB}}{\sqrt{1 - C^2}} \), where C is a constant derived from the problem.
   - The result shows that one spacecraft would measure the other as 1.19 kilometers long due to length contraction.

2. **Relativistic Momentum in Particle Collisions**:
   - Two identical particles move towards each other at \(3.1 \times 10^8\) meters per second, or approximately two-thirds the speed of light (C).
   - The task is to determine their relative velocity and the relativistic momentum as observed by one particle from another.
   - Using the same relativistic velocity addition formula, the relative velocity (VAC) is calculated.
   - Relativistic momentum \( P = \frac{mV}{\sqrt{1 - V^2/C^2}} \) is used to find the momentum of one particle as observed by the other.
   - The computed momentum value is approximately \(6.09 \times 10^{-17}\) kilograms meters per second.

The text involves applying principles from Einstein's theory of relativity, particularly the effects on measurements like length and momentum when objects move at significant fractions of the speed of light relative to each other.
