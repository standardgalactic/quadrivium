The text examines Bernoulli's equation and its behavior under specific conditions, focusing on two special cases determined by the value of \( n \):

1. **When \( n = 0 \):** The equation simplifies to a standard linear differential form: \( y' + p(x)y = f(x) \), because \( y^n \) becomes 1.

2. **When \( n = 1 \):** It turns into a homogeneous linear equation: \( y' + q(x)y = 0 \), where the terms involving \( f(x)y \) and \( p(x)y \) cancel each other out, allowing it to be rewritten as \( y' + (p(x) - f(x))y = 0 \).

Bernoulli's equation remains non-linear and requires substitution when neither \( n \) nor another parameter \( m \) equals 0 or 1. For true Bernoulli equations where \( n \neq 0 \) and \( n \neq 1 \), the recommended solution approach is to use the substitution \( y = u^{1-n} \). This converts the non-linear equation into a linear form, making it easier to solve.
