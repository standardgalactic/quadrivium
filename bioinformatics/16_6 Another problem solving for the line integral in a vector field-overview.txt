Let's analyze the problem step by step, focusing on evaluating line integrals along different paths and determining whether they are path-independent.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Vector Field**: The vector field given seems to be \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)\).

2. **Line Integrals**: We need to evaluate the line integral of this vector field along different paths from point \(A(0, 0)\) to point \(B(1, 1)\).

3. **Path Independence**: If the value of the line integral is the same for any path between two points, then the vector field is conservative (path-independent), and we can find a potential function.

### Paths Considered

#### Path 1: Straight Line from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\)

- **Parameterization**: \(x = t\), \(y = t\) where \(t\) ranges from 0 to 1.
- **Differentials**: \(dx = dt\), \(dy = dt\).
- **Integral**:
  \[
  \int_C (x^2 + y^2) \, dx + (2xy) \, dy = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t^2) \, dt + (2t^2) \, dt
  \]
  \[
  = \int_0^1 (2t^2 + 2t^2) \, dt = \int_0^1 4t^2 \, dt = \left[ \frac{4}{3} t^3 \right]_0^1 = \frac{4}{3}
  \]

#### Path 2: Parabolic Path \(y = x^2\)

- **Parameterization**: \(x = t\), \(y = t^2\) where \(t\) ranges from 0 to 1.
- **Differentials**: \(dx = dt\), \(dy = 2t \, dt\).
- **Integral**:
  \[
  \int_C (x^2 + y^2) \, dx + (2xy) \, dy = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t^4) \, dt + (2t^3) \cdot (2t \, dt)
  \]
  \[
  = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t^4) \, dt + \int_0^1 4t^4 \, dt = \int_0^1 (t^2 + 5t^4) \, dt
  \]
  \[
  = \left[ \frac{1}{3} t^3 + t^5 \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{4}{3}
  \]

#### Path 3: Any Other Path

- Without specific parameterization, we assume the same result due to path independence.

### Conclusion

The line integral of the vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)\) from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\) is \(\frac{4}{3}\) for any path. This indicates that the vector field is conservative and path-independent.

### Potential Function

To confirm path independence, we can find a potential function \(f(x, y)\) such that:

\[
\nabla f = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)
\]

- Integrate \(x^2 + y^2\) with respect to \(x\):
  \[
  f(x, y) = \frac{x^3}{3} + xy^2 + g(y)
  \]

- Differentiate with respect to \(y\) and equate to \(2xy\):
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xy + g'(y) = 2xy
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow g'(y) = 0 \Rightarrow g(y) = C
  \]

Thus, the potential function is:

\[
f(x, y) = \frac{x^3}{3} + xy^2 + C
\]

The line integral from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\) is \(f(1, 1) - f(0, 0) = \left(\frac{1}{3} + 1\right) - 0 = \frac{4}{3}\).

This confirms the path independence of the vector field.

The text discusses a property of conservative vector fields: in such fields, if you move from an initial point to a final point, the result is independent of the path taken. This implies that certain characteristics or quantities (like potential energy) remain constant regardless of how you traverse between these points. The speaker suggests that more information will be provided later on this topic.

To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the line integral of the vector field \(\mathbf{F} = (x^2 + y^2)\mathbf{i} + 2xy\mathbf{j}\) along different paths from the point \( (0,0) \) to \( (1,1) \). The key observation is that if the line integral yields the same result regardless of the path taken, then the vector field is conservative, and the work done is path-independent.

### Path 1: \( y = x \)

For this path, parameterize it as \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t)\) where \(t\) ranges from 0 to 1. Then:

- \(x = t\), \(y = t\)
- \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 1\), \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 1\)

The differential elements are:
\[ dx = dt, \quad dy = dt \]

Substitute into the integral:
\[
\int_C (x^2 + y^2) \, dx + 2xy \, dy = \int_0^1 ((t^2 + t^2) \, dt + 2(t)(t) \, dt)
\]
\[
= \int_0^1 (2t^2 + 2t^2) \, dt = \int_0^1 4t^2 \, dt
\]

Evaluate the integral:
\[
= 4 \left[ \frac{t^3}{3} \right]_0^1 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

### Path 2: \( y = x^2 \)

For this path, parameterize it as \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t^2)\) where \(t\) ranges from 0 to 1. Then:

- \(x = t\), \(y = t^2\)
- \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 1\), \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t\)

The differential elements are:
\[ dx = dt, \quad dy = 2t \, dt \]

Substitute into the integral:
\[
\int_C (x^2 + y^2) \, dx + 2xy \, dy = \int_0^1 ((t^2 + t^4) \, dt + 2(t)(t^2) \cdot 2t \, dt)
\]
\[
= \int_0^1 (t^2 + t^4 + 4t^4) \, dt = \int_0^1 (t^2 + 5t^4) \, dt
\]

Evaluate the integral:
\[
= \left[ \frac{t^3}{3} + \frac{5t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left( \frac{1}{3} + 1 \right) = \frac{4}{3}
\]

### Conclusion

For both paths, the line integral evaluates to \(\frac{4}{3}\). This indicates that the vector field is conservative and the work done is path-independent. The value of the line integral from \( (0,0) \) to \( (1,1) \) is consistently \(\frac{4}{3}\), regardless of the path taken.

The text discusses the concept of a conservative vector field. In such fields, if you start from an initial point and end at a final point, the work done or energy expended is the same regardless of the path taken between these two points. The text suggests that further details about conservative vector fields will be covered later.
