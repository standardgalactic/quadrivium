Let's analyze the problem step by step, focusing on evaluating line integrals along different paths and determining whether they are path-independent.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Vector Field**: The vector field given seems to be \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)\).

2. **Line Integrals**: We need to evaluate the line integral of this vector field along different paths from point \(A(0, 0)\) to point \(B(1, 1)\).

3. **Path Independence**: If the value of the line integral is the same for any path between two points, then the vector field is conservative (path-independent), and we can find a potential function.

### Paths Considered

#### Path 1: Straight Line from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\)

- **Parameterization**: \(x = t\), \(y = t\) where \(t\) ranges from 0 to 1.
- **Differentials**: \(dx = dt\), \(dy = dt\).
- **Integral**:
  \[
  \int_C (x^2 + y^2) \, dx + (2xy) \, dy = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t^2) \, dt + (2t^2) \, dt
  \]
  \[
  = \int_0^1 (2t^2 + 2t^2) \, dt = \int_0^1 4t^2 \, dt = \left[ \frac{4}{3} t^3 \right]_0^1 = \frac{4}{3}
  \]

#### Path 2: Parabolic Path \(y = x^2\)

- **Parameterization**: \(x = t\), \(y = t^2\) where \(t\) ranges from 0 to 1.
- **Differentials**: \(dx = dt\), \(dy = 2t \, dt\).
- **Integral**:
  \[
  \int_C (x^2 + y^2) \, dx + (2xy) \, dy = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t^4) \, dt + (2t^3) \cdot (2t \, dt)
  \]
  \[
  = \int_0^1 (t^2 + t^4) \, dt + \int_0^1 4t^4 \, dt = \int_0^1 (t^2 + 5t^4) \, dt
  \]
  \[
  = \left[ \frac{1}{3} t^3 + t^5 \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{4}{3}
  \]

#### Path 3: Any Other Path

- Without specific parameterization, we assume the same result due to path independence.

### Conclusion

The line integral of the vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)\) from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\) is \(\frac{4}{3}\) for any path. This indicates that the vector field is conservative and path-independent.

### Potential Function

To confirm path independence, we can find a potential function \(f(x, y)\) such that:

\[
\nabla f = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)
\]

- Integrate \(x^2 + y^2\) with respect to \(x\):
  \[
  f(x, y) = \frac{x^3}{3} + xy^2 + g(y)
  \]

- Differentiate with respect to \(y\) and equate to \(2xy\):
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2xy + g'(y) = 2xy
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow g'(y) = 0 \Rightarrow g(y) = C
  \]

Thus, the potential function is:

\[
f(x, y) = \frac{x^3}{3} + xy^2 + C
\]

The line integral from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\) is \(f(1, 1) - f(0, 0) = \left(\frac{1}{3} + 1\right) - 0 = \frac{4}{3}\).

This confirms the path independence of the vector field.

The text discusses a property of conservative vector fields: in such fields, if you move from an initial point to a final point, the result is independent of the path taken. This implies that certain characteristics or quantities (like potential energy) remain constant regardless of how you traverse between these points. The speaker suggests that more information will be provided later on this topic.
