Here's a summary of the text discussing two optical problems involving lenses:

1. **Single Symmetric Mirror Problem:**
   - An object is placed in front of a symmetric mirror (concave or convex) with equal radii of curvature on both sides.
   - The image formed is inverted and reduced, with a magnification factor of -0.25, indicating it's real as the image distance (\( S_i \)) is positive.
   - The lens is converging due to its higher refractive index than the surrounding medium.
   - Calculations yield an object distance (\( S_0 = 20 \) cm) and image distance (\( S_i = 5 \) cm), with a focal length (\( F \)) of 4.00 cm.
   - Using the lens maker's formula, the radius of curvature (\( R \)) is approximately 5.2 cm.

2. **Two-Lens System Problem:**
   - Two convex lenses are aligned on the same axis with focal lengths of 24 cm and 9 cm, separated by 10 cm.
   - An object is placed 6 cm from the first lens.
   - For the first lens:
     - The image formed is virtual, upright, and located 8 cm on the same side as the object (at -8 cm).
   - This virtual image acts as an object for the second lens:
     - It's positioned 18 cm from the second lens.
     - The resulting image is real, inverted, and 18 cm from the second lens on the opposite side.

The text illustrates principles of magnification, focal length, and the lens makerâ€™s equation in forming images through lenses.
