The text explains the principles and calculations involved in radiocarbon dating using carbon-14 (C-14) activity to estimate the age of organic materials. Hereâ€™s a concise summary:

1. **Carbon Dating Basics**: Living organisms maintain a constant level of C-14, which begins to decay at a known rate after death since they no longer absorb it.

2. **Decay Constant (\(\lambda\))**: Calculated using \(\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{\text{half-life}}\) with the half-life of C-14 being about 5730 years, expressed in seconds for accuracy.

3. **Activity (A)**: Measured as decay rate in Becquerels (Bq), representing decays per second. The activity is compared between when an organism was alive and at present to determine age.

4. **Calculating Age**: Utilizes the formula \( t = \frac{\ln(\frac{A_0}{A})}{\lambda} \) where:
   - \( A_0 \) is original activity.
   - \( A \) is current activity.
   - \( \lambda \) is the decay constant.

5. **Example Calculation**: With an original activity of 0.23 Bq, a current activity of 1.21 Bq, and a decay constant of \(3.83 \times 10^{-12}\) s\(^{-1}\), the sample's age is calculated to be approximately 5,300 years.

6. **Considerations**: The method assumes stable C-14 levels over time, which can vary due to cosmic ray intensity changes, and is most reliable up to about 50,000 years. Beyond this, accuracy may decrease.

This summary outlines how radiocarbon dating estimates the age of archaeological samples through measuring C-14 decay.
