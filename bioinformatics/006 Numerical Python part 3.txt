and here we are in lecture five we're continuing our look into numerical python this will be part
three of that and for the first time we're going to do something slightly useful we're going to
look at simple calculus by simple calculus i mean multi-variable calculus and even simpler
than that we're only going to look at polynomials let's have a look so here we are in the shell
we're going to import numpy again as np and here we go we're going to create this
function f and it's going to be a polynomial and a polynomial means of of a single variable
or one dimension so you can have x in it x here referring to the fact that it's the independent
variable that's how we teach it at school let's just put it in there let's just say it's it's y
equals some function of x so x is now our independent variable y is our dependent variable we're just
going to create this function and a polynomial means that independent variable is raised to the
to some integer power in other words i could have that x to the power two remember python we we don't
write that little hat sign we write two asterisks so x squared that's a second order polynomial because
the highest exponent of our independent variable is two so let's go have a look we're just going to call
our function f and it's going to be a numpy dot poly one d that stands for one dimensional polynomial
one dimensional there's just x in it just one single independent variable and now i've got to tell it
what the coefficients are and i've got to put that in those square brackets inside of the parentheses
the reason being the following um let's have this y equals f of x now um remember it's a x
x squared plus b x plus c is what what we called but that might as well have been a x cubed plus b x
squared plus c x plus d okay the a b c and d those refer to the coefficients and it's those coefficients
that we're going to list here from left to right from the largest order independent variable exponent
here it will be x cubed so i will put a first then a value for b then a value for c then a value for d
this last one remembers this x to the power zero and numpy is going to interpret it in this order
let's just have three this is a three comma four comma one that would be the a value so that's going
to be three x squared plus four x plus one as opposed to this example i've given here let's neaten
this up so that there's no confusion let's do that and let's just do that that's the polynomial we're
going to have and an actual fact so that c is just going to be one and the b is going to be a four
and the a is going to be a three so it's three x squared plus four x plus one that's what we have
and if i say f it's a poly 1d one dimensional polynomial but look at what happens if i say
print f look at that that's a thing of beauty three x squared plus four x plus one and i can get fancier
than that i can say well let's have f times f if and look at that it took my second order polynomial
and it multiplied it with itself and now i have nine x to the power four plus 24 x q plus 22 x
square plus eight x plus one very quick way for you to check the simple homework that you might
that you might have and i promised in the beginning that we're going to look at some simple calculus
because look at this beauty i can say f dot deriv for first order derivative and look at that i put
the print functions is going to give me that and that's six x plus four and i'll be held three x
square plus four x plus one the first derivative of that would be six x plus four that's beautiful
you you can't deny i can also get the integral now that would be f dot intake the only thing here i've
got to give it the constant of integration remember if it's in just an integration sign without lower
and upper bounds values then it will just have a constant of integration which we usually just
say plus c but i can put that constant and let's say constant equals five so here i've got to i've got
to do that i can also just put zero and then i'll just have to remember of course the fact that i have
to put the plus c in manually and look at that one x well x cube plus two x squared plus one x remember
plus c this is what it should actually have uh just have a look at this so intake let's just have
uh k equals four then i'm going to have the plus four at the end so it's not going to help you
uh or or or just these functions not going to help you just to do um the math if you have up and
no bounces putting it like this you just have to put the value for c in manually but the rest of it is
quite beautiful and as much as you can do the first order derivative and the the simple integration
for you of a certain dimensional polynomial so that's a very useful function right here
on your computer that you quickly do just to check your own work
