The text introduces sets as essential components in mathematics, particularly within abstract algebra and discrete mathematics. A set is defined as a well-defined collection of distinct elements, represented by capital letters with elements enclosed in curly braces. Examples include natural numbers up to 5 (\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}) and those divisible by 5 (\{5, 10, 15, ...\}).

The text outlines standard mathematical sets:
- \(\mathbb{N}\): Natural numbers \{1, 2, 3, ...\}
- \(\mathbb{Z}\): Integers {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
- \(\mathbb{Q}\): Rational numbers as fractions \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers and \(q \neq 0\)
- \(\mathbb{R}\): Real numbers, including both rational and irrational numbers

It states that two sets are equal if they contain identical elements, regardless of repetition. The concept of subsets is introduced as a topic for further study in the course.
