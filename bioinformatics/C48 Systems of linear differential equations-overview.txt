The text discusses solving systems of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with two dependent variables, \(x\) and \(y\), as functions of an independent variable \(t\). The focus is on homogeneous systems where both equations equal zero.

Starting with two specific ODEs:

1. \(\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y = 0\)
2. \(\frac{dy}{dt} - 3x - 2y = 0\)

The goal is to find solutions for \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\). The process involves eliminating one variable to solve the system simultaneously:

1. Rewrite the first equation to express \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) in terms of \(y\) and substitute into the second equation.
2. This substitution simplifies the system, leading to a single ODE for \(y\).
3. Solve this ODE using the auxiliary equation method, resulting in solutions involving exponential functions.

The solution forms:

- For \(y(t)\): \(c_1 e^{-3t} + c_2 e^{2t}\)
- For \(x(t)\), follow a similar process to find: \(c_3 e^{-3t} + c_4 e^{2t}\)

Since the system is linear, there are dependencies between constants. By substituting back and ensuring terms equal zero for all \(t\), express \(c_3\) and \(c_4\) in terms of \(c_1\) and \(c_2\).

The final solutions for \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) depend on two arbitrary constants, reflecting the system's degree of freedom.

The text provides an explanation on solving systems of linear ordinary differential equations with a focus on homogeneous systems. The system involves two equations dependent on an independent variable \( t \), both set to zero. These are:

1. \(\frac{dx}{dt} + 2\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = 0\)
2. \(\frac{dx}{dt} - 3x - 2y = 0\)

The solution approach involves eliminating one of the variables (e.g., \( x \)) by expressing it in terms of the other variable (\( y \)) and its derivatives, then substituting back into the system to simplify. This leads to a homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients for \( y(t) \). The auxiliary equation method is used to find solutions involving exponential functions. Constants from these solutions (e.g., \( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 \)) are related due to the system's linearity, allowing them to be expressed in terms of just two constants (\( c_1, c_2 \)). This results in expressions for both \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), ensuring they satisfy both original equations.
