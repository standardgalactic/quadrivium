The video introduces Coulomb's law, which describes the force between two charged objects or particles. The law is expressed mathematically as the electrostatic constant multiplied by the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This relationship makes it an inverse square law, meaning that the force decreases with the square of the distance.

Coulomb's law also states that forces between charges are action-reaction pairs; they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. The force is a vector quantity: like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract. Additionally, charged particles obey the superposition principle—forces from multiple charges can be added to find the net force—and partly follow the shell theorem, which states that a spherical shell of uniform charge affects outside charges as if all its charge were concentrated at its center.

The electrostatic constant (\(k\)) can also be expressed in terms of the permittivity of free space (\(\varepsilon_0\)), where \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \). The permittivity constant is essential for converting between different units used in electromagnetism.

The video uses an example with two positively charged particles to illustrate Coulomb's law. If the charges are on the x-axis, and one charge is double that of the other, they will repel each other, and we can calculate the magnitude of this force using Coulomb’s law.

When a third negatively charged particle is introduced between them, it doesn't affect the original force but adds to it through superposition. The total or net electrostatic force on one of the particles includes forces due to all other particles present, taking into account both magnitudes and directions.

The text describes analyzing forces between particles. It explains that particle 1 experiences repulsion from particle 2, resulting in a negative force in the positive direction due to attraction by particle 2 and particle 3. The net force on particle 1 is directed towards particles 2 and 3, which are to its right.

In part 3, particle 1's position changes, forming a 60-degree angle with the x-axis while remaining 0.015 meters from its initial point. The vector representing the force can be decomposed into x and y components using cosine and sine of the angle, respectively. This results in net forces on both axes, allowing the magnitude of the new resultant force on particle 1 due to particles 2 and 3 to be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Further details are promised in a subsequent video.
