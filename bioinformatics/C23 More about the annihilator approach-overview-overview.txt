The text explores trigonometric functions combined with polynomials and exponential terms, focusing on expressions like \( e^{\alpha x} \cos(bx) \) and \( e^{\alpha x} \sin(bx) \), where the polynomial component can be as simple as a constant or extend up to \( x^{n-1} \). These functions are considered transcendental due to their exponential components. An annihilating operator, given by \( D^2 - 2\alpha D + (\alpha^2 + \beta^2)^n \), is introduced for handling such functions within differential equations. The order of this operator exceeds the polynomial degree by one. Future content will provide practical examples demonstrating how to apply this concept.
