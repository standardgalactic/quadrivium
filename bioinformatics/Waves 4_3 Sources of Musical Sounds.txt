Okay, imagine that I have a well, again, with water. I need to know what this dip is.
What I notice is my fundamental frequency that I can set up with F1 equals 7 hertz, 7.00 hertz.
And I'm also told, obviously this is now an open-closed system, I'm told that the density of air we measure here has 1.10 kilograms per cubic meter.
And the bulk modulus, yeah, the modulus here equals 1.33 times 10 to the power of 5 pesca.
I want to know what this length L is. How deep is the water? How deep is the water?
Now we're dealing with an open-closed system.
We're dealing with an open-closed system.
So one thing I know is F of N equals N V over 4L.
In this instance, we have F of 1 equals 7.00 hertz equals, I don't know what the velocity is, divided by 4 times.
I don't know what the length is.
But I do know what the velocity is, because given these two, the modulus and the density, I can't figure out what the velocity is.
Inasmuch as it is just the square root of the modulus divided by the density.
So what I have here is, if I just bring L up and F1 down there, I'm going to have L equals V over F1.
That is going to be the square root of the modulus divided by density, divided by frequency.
Where I am in frequency 1, I'm bringing L up, so it's divided by 4 times frequency 1.
And if I substitute all of that, I get a length of about, it is 12.4 meters.
So just substituting modulus density and frequency, fundamental frequency 7 there, 7 times 4 is 28.
A basic algebraic problem shouldn't give you any difficulties.
And if we're
