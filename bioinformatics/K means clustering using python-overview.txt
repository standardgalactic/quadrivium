The text describes a process of using k-means clustering to analyze responses from patients in a healthcare study. In this scenario, 99 patients use a smartwatch healthcare data app that collects information requiring them to actively sync with researchers due to regulations. To encourage syncing, six different types of reminder campaigns (emails, SMS, WhatsApp messages, pamphlets, telephone calls, and long letters) are sent out 32 times throughout the year.

The goal is to determine which patients responded to specific campaigns using k-means clustering in Python, specifically employing the scikit-learn library. The analysis aims to create five clusters to identify patterns in patient responses without having too many clusters given that there are fewer than 99 possible clusters (since 5x7=35). 

The process involves setting up a Jupyter Notebook with necessary libraries such as pandas for data management, numpy for numerical operations, scikit-learn for clustering and PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and Plotly for visualization. The data is organized into two Excel sheets: one detailing the campaigns and another capturing patient responses, which are then merged to form a comprehensive dataset.

A pivot table is constructed to count the occurrences of each campaign response by patient, using these counts as input for k-means clustering to reveal insights on campaign effectiveness and patient engagement patterns. This approach could also be applied in business contexts such as analyzing marketing campaigns relative to sales responses.

The text describes a process for analyzing patient responses to various campaigns using a pivoted table and applying machine learning techniques. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Data Setup**: A pivot table is created with campaigns as column headers and patients on the rows, where non-responses are marked as `NAN`. These `NAN` values are replaced by zeros, and either 'patient' or 'campaign ID' can be set as the index.

2. **Column Extraction**: The campaign IDs (1 to 32) are extracted for later use in dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

3. **Clustering with k-Means**:
   - A k-means clustering is performed with `k=5` clusters, chosen because it's significantly less than the number of patients.
   - The clustering process assigns each patient to a cluster based on their campaign response pattern.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is used to reduce the data dimensionality from 32 dimensions (campaigns) to two principal components (X and Y), facilitating visualization in a scatter plot.

5. **Data Merging**: A new DataFrame is created with 'patient', 'cluster', 'X', and 'Y' columns, which is then merged with response data for further analysis.

6. **Visualization**: Using Plotly, an interactive scatter plot is generated where each cluster (trace) is plotted as a distinct color and shape on the 2D plane defined by the PCA components.

The process results in an interactive visualization showing how patients are clustered based on their responses to different campaigns.

The text describes using K-means clustering to analyze patient response data for different communication methods, such as WhatsApp, telephone, SMS pamphlets, and long letters. The analysis identified clusters of patients based on their responses. Specifically, cluster 1 includes patients who responded well to WhatsApp and somewhat to telephone but showed little interest in SMS pamphlets or long letters.

The author suggests that future communications with this group should focus on WhatsApp and telephone calls, as these were the most effective methods for them. Email was not a preferred communication channel for this cluster. The analysis also revealed there are 49 patients in cluster 1, allowing targeted campaigns to be developed for them in subsequent years.

The process of clustering is described as straightforward to implement using Python, encouraging others to try it themselves.

The video discusses using k-means clustering with Python's scikit-learn library to analyze healthcare data collected from smartwatches. The example involves 99 patients who participate in a study where their app-synced data must be actively shared with researchers due to regulations.

To remind patients to sync their data, six types of campaigns (emails, SMS, WhatsApp messages, pamphlets, telephone calls, and letters) are sent out over the year, each uniquely identified from campaign 1 to 32. Each campaign only uses one type of reminder. The objective is to identify which campaigns certain patients respond to using k-means clustering.

The plan is to create five clusters (chosen because \(5 \times 7 = 35\), which is less than the total number of patients, 99). This helps categorize patient responses without creating too many clusters. 

For implementation:
- The analysis will use Jupyter Notebook with a custom style sheet.
- Pandas will manage data, specifically using `read_excel` and `merge`.
- Numpy provides additional functionality like `arange`.
- Scikit-learn's k-means and principal component analysis (PCA) are imported for clustering and dimensionality reduction, respectively.
- Plotly is used for offline graph plotting within Jupyter Notebook.

Data preparation involves:
1. Reading from an Excel file with two sheets into separate data frames (`df_campaign` and `df_response`).
2. Merging these data frames on the campaign ID column.
3. Creating a pivot table to count responses per campaign.

The analysis aims to provide insights into patient behavior regarding campaign responses, which could also be applied to marketing campaigns for sales response analysis.

The text outlines steps taken to analyze and visualize campaign response data using pivoting, filling missing values, re-indexing, applying k-means clustering, dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis (PCA), and creating an interactive scatter plot with Plotly.

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - A pivot table is created where campaigns are column headers, and patients are row indices.
   - Non-responses to a campaign are initially marked as NaN but later replaced by zeros for clarity.
   - The index of the table is reset so that either patient identifiers or campaign IDs can serve as indices.

2. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - A subset of columns (campaigns 1-32) is extracted from the pivot table for further analysis, intended to be used with PCA and clustering algorithms.

3. **Clustering**:
   - K-means clustering is applied on the dataset using five clusters.
   - The number of clusters is chosen based on a rule of thumb that relates to the total number of patients (99).

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the data from 32 dimensions to two, facilitating visualization in a scatter plot.

5. **Data Merging and Visualization**:
   - The clustered data is merged with response data to create a final dataset including campaign details.
   - Plotly is used to generate an interactive scatter plot that visualizes patients as points distributed across different clusters based on their responses to campaigns.

6. **Plotly Configuration**:
   - Each cluster is represented as a separate trace in the plot, distinguished by colors and outlines.
   - The final visualization shows how patients are grouped into clusters based on campaign response patterns, allowing for interactive exploration of data clustering results.

The text describes how K-means clustering is used to analyze patient response data to different communication methods, such as WhatsApp, telephone, SMS pamphlets, and long letters. The process involves creating a column to indicate which cluster (in this case, Cluster 1 or Column 0) each patient belongs to. By analyzing the responses within this cluster, it's observed that these patients respond well to WhatsApp and telephone but not to other methods like SMS pamphlets or long letters.

Additionally, email is noted as another method that did not elicit a response from these patients. Based on this analysis, future campaigns could target Cluster 1 with WhatsApp messages and telephone calls for better engagement. The process also includes listing the 49 patients in Cluster 1 to tailor communication strategies effectively in subsequent campaigns. K-means clustering is highlighted as straightforward when implemented using Python, encouraging others to try it themselves.
