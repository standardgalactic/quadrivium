The text outlines a method for approximating the area under an irregular shape by dividing it into four equal squares. The width of each square's base is calculated using \((b-a)/n\), where \(a = 0\), \(b = 1\), and \(n = 4\). This results in a base width (\(\Delta x\)) of \(1/4\).

The area under the shape is approximated by calculating the heights at specific points using upper sums. These heights are determined at intervals: 
- The first height at \(x = 0\) (denoted as \(f(c_1)\)),
- The second height at \(x = 1/4\) (\(f(c_2)\)), and so on for subsequent intervals.

The total area is then expressed as the sum of the areas of each rectangle, calculated by multiplying each height by \(\Delta x\):

\[ \text{Area} = f(c_1) \times \Delta x + f(c_2) \times \Delta x + f(c_3) \times \Delta x + f(c_4) \times \Delta x. \]

This method is related to the concept of integration, where function values at specific points (\(f(c_i)\)) and consistent base widths (\(\Delta x\)) are used to approximate areas under curves. However, there may be unclear or incorrect parts in the text that do not significantly impact this summary.
