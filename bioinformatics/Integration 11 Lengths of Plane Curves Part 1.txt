Just as we approximated the area under the curve on an interval by summing an infinite number of rectangles under the curve,
we can determine the length of a curve on an interval by dividing it with points on the curve and determining the length between each consecutive point.
Here we have the graph of a function defined parametrically by x equals the f of t and y equals the g of t.
Both the functions f and g are continuously differentiable and their derivatives are not simultaneously zero.
If we consider the segment between point p and p , the length between these two points will be lk
and that equals the square root of delta xk squared plus delta yk squared.
Substituting the x and y values gives us this equation.
This represents x2 minus x1 if you think back to algebra and y2 minus y1.
But remember that the position of the x-axis is defined by the f of t and the y is defined by the g of t.
As delta t gets smaller, the length lk starts to approximate the length of the arc between p and p .
Now, cast your thoughts back to the mean value theorem.
There are numbers tk for x and tk for y on the interval from tk minus 1 to tk such that
delta xk equals the f of tk minus the f of tk minus 1 and that equals the first order derivative of f of tk that 4x times delta tk.
And the same goes for delta yk.
Assuming that the path from a to b is traversed only once as t increases, the length of the curve from a to b will be the sum of all the lengths lk.
Providing that t lies between a and b and that f' and g' are continuous and not simultaneously zero on the interval from a to b,
and lastly that there is no doubling back or retracing of the curve,
then this is the equation for the length of a curve c defined by two parametric equations.
