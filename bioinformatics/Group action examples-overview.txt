The text provides an explanation and examples of group actions with a focus on the concept of non-faithful group actions. A group action involves a group \( G \) acting on a set \( A \), where each element of \( G \) corresponds to a permutation of \( A \). In faithful group actions, each permutation is uniquely represented by an element of \( G \); however, in non-faithful group actions, more than one element of \( G \) can represent the same permutation.

The first example demonstrates a non-faithful action where every element of the group \( G \) acts on set \( A \) such that each maps to the identity permutation. This means no matter which element from \( G \) is used, it leaves all elements of \( A \) unchanged. The properties required for a group action—closure and compatibility with the group operation—are verified as holding true in this scenario.

The second example relates to Cayley's table, where the group acts on itself under its binary operation. Here, the elements of the group are combined using this operation, adhering to the associative property and involving an identity element. This setup exemplifies how group actions can be used to construct a representation of the group in terms of its own structure.

The overall message highlights that non-faithful group actions can occur and provides insight into understanding group properties through these examples.

The text describes how binary operations in groups can be understood as group actions. Specifically, these are self-actions where a group acts on itself. In this context, the set being acted upon is actually the group itself, highlighting the inherent symmetry and structure within the groups through their own elements and operations. This perspective emphasizes that studying group actions often means examining how groups operate internally on themselves.

The text provides an explanation and examples of group actions, with a focus on a non-faithful group action. Here’s a summary:

1. **Group Actions Overview**: The discussion begins by reviewing the concept of group actions, where a group \( G \) acts on a set \( A \). In a faithful group action, each element of the group corresponds to a unique permutation of the set. However, in a non-faithful group action, multiple elements from the group can result in the same permutation.

2. **Non-Faithful Group Action Example**: An example is given where every element of \( G \) maps to the identity permutation on set \( A \). This means that any group element acting on \( A \) leaves it unchanged (e.g., 1 maps to 1, 2 maps to 2, etc.). Thus, all elements in \( G \) map to the same permutation, demonstrating a non-faithful action.

3. **Properties of Group Actions**: The text verifies that the two main properties of group actions hold for this example:
   - For any \( g_1, g_2 \in G \) and \( A \in A \), \( (g_1 \cdot g_2) \cdot A = g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot A) \).
   - The identity element of the group acts as the identity on \( A \).

4. **Cayley's Table Connection**: The text also connects this discussion to Cayley’s table, which is a representation of a group's operation. Here, the action of the group on itself through its binary operation satisfies the properties of group actions and reflects the associative property.

5. **Conclusion**: The examples illustrate both non-faithful group actions and how Cayley's table can be seen as a special case of group action. These insights help deepen the understanding of group actions beyond the typical faithful scenario.

The text explains that when discussing certain binary operations within a mathematical context, what is essentially described are group actions. Specifically, these are group actions where a group acts on itself. This self-action occurs in the group that forms the underlying structure or set being considered. In summary, the concept of group actions is central to understanding how groups can interact with themselves through specific binary operations.
