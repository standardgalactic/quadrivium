The text provides an explanation and examples of group actions with a focus on the concept of non-faithful group actions. A group action involves a group \( G \) acting on a set \( A \), where each element of \( G \) corresponds to a permutation of \( A \). In faithful group actions, each permutation is uniquely represented by an element of \( G \); however, in non-faithful group actions, more than one element of \( G \) can represent the same permutation.

The first example demonstrates a non-faithful action where every element of the group \( G \) acts on set \( A \) such that each maps to the identity permutation. This means no matter which element from \( G \) is used, it leaves all elements of \( A \) unchanged. The properties required for a group action—closure and compatibility with the group operation—are verified as holding true in this scenario.

The second example relates to Cayley's table, where the group acts on itself under its binary operation. Here, the elements of the group are combined using this operation, adhering to the associative property and involving an identity element. This setup exemplifies how group actions can be used to construct a representation of the group in terms of its own structure.

The overall message highlights that non-faithful group actions can occur and provides insight into understanding group properties through these examples.

The text describes how binary operations in groups can be understood as group actions. Specifically, these are self-actions where a group acts on itself. In this context, the set being acted upon is actually the group itself, highlighting the inherent symmetry and structure within the groups through their own elements and operations. This perspective emphasizes that studying group actions often means examining how groups operate internally on themselves.
