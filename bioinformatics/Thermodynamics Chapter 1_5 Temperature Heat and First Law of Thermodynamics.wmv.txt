Welcome to the last video for this chapter. We're going to look at heat transfer mechanisms.
Heat can be transferred in one of three ways, either conduction or convection or by radiation.
Conduction occurs due to physical contact between systems.
And it is about the kinetic energy of the constituent particles in the system being increased as the heat energy spreads through them.
So if you've got a long metal rod and you put it into the fire, eventually the kinetic energy of the atoms of that metal at the bottom
where there's contact with the heat source will increase and that will be, that increased kinetic energy will be given over from particle to particle
up the rod till the metal rod in your hand becomes hot.
So if you think about it, the spread of heat energy depends on the length of the material.
So if you're holding a longer rod, obviously it can take longer for it to become hot in your hand.
The difference in temperature between the two sides.
And then lastly, the thermal conductivity of the material.
Second lastly, the thermal conductivity of the material and then lastly the contact surface.
And that is how we get to this equation.
So P conductive, remember that P is power, so we're going to end up in joules per second.
There we have heat, which is joules, and there we have time, so that will be joules per second.
And that's going to equal this K, which is thermal conductivity, we'll get to it later, times the area, times the difference in the temperature.
But remember, it's always from hot to cold, so it's temperature hot minus temperature cold divided by length.
So as I said, K is thermal conductivity and that depends on the material.
The different metals will be different and that will be obviously quite different from non-metals.
And we get watts per meter per Kelvin as units.
Conduction can also take place through a series of materials, each with their own length and thermal conductivity.
So it needn't only be one.
In solving problems relating to conduction, it will be stated that the transfer is a steady state process.
And that is extremely important.
And it's a clue for you as to how to solve some of these problems.
What it means is that the rate of transfer through each material must be equal.
Otherwise, heat is going to build up in one of the materials.
And there won't be the steady flow through them.
Now look at this schematic at the bottom.
There's a hot reservoir on this side, a cold reservoir on this side.
And the heat flows through in that direction from hot to cold.
There's two materials, and this is why we talk of length.
Even though in the problems it's slabs, it's the length in meters that heat has to traverse across the slab.
And then there's an interface area between these, so that is the area.
But because they're steady state, the P conductive or the power, in other words joule per second, through this has to be exactly the same as through that.
Let me change colors of this, it's got to be exactly the same as that.
There's a steady state.
And if you have to add up all of them, it's just the area divided by the difference in temperature.
Area times temperature hot minus temperature cold.
Divided by the sum, i equals 1, of the length, divided by k, remember, the thermal conductivity.
So you can sum them all up.
Here's the first problem.
The figure shows the face, so these are the faces here, here, here.
And interface temperatures of a composite slab consisting of four materials of identical thickness through which heat transfer is steady.
So P conductive through each of them must be exactly the same.
Rank the materials according to their thermal conductivities.
Remember thermal conductivity is k.
We know the equation for the power of conduction.
So k, I shouldn't really call it power, but it's joules per second.
That's what I mean.
The conductive heat transfer, thermal energy transfer.
Now, k is thermal conductivity.
So through easy enough algebra, we can get k on the left hand side.
And we can get k for a, and k for b, and k for c, and k for d.
So that's going to be p conductive, which is the same for all four of them, because it's a steady state.
Length is the same for all four, so it's stated in the problem.
A area is the same for all of them.
So all these three, in all of our four cases, are going to be equal to each other.
So we can just replace it with some constant c there.
C over 25 minus 15.
So temperature hot to temperature cold over this first one.
So it's going to be some constant over 10, sorry, degrees Celsius.
The second one, there's a 5 degree difference.
There's a 15 degree difference there.
And lastly, there's a 5 degree difference there.
So we're going to get constant over 10, constant over 5, constant over 15, constant over 5.
Clearly, b and d are equal, and they're the largest.
And then comes a at over 10, and c over 15.
The larger the denominator, obviously, the smaller the final value.
Let's look at this problem.
In the figure, an internal pine panel, which is here.
And an external brick wall, which is there.
Are separated by two layers of unknown materials with identical thickness.
So the L is the same.
And thermal conductivity, K is even the same.
The contact areas are A, and thermal conductivity has reached steady state.
That's the clue.
Calculate the interface.
I think that got a bit lost behind this.
The interface between the brick wall.
Let me just read you.
Between the brick wall and the last of the, so right there, temperature 4.
That's what we need to get.
Now, what we are given is that this is length L, and that the brick wall is 2L.
We're also given that the thermal conductivity of pine is K, and of, let me change color there,
and of the brick wall is 5K.
Okay, there's again our equation, easy enough.
Thermal conductivity times area times the difference in temperature divided by length.
So for A, we can write our equation, and we can write 25 minus 20.
And for D, if we substitute all the values, we know KD is 5K, and the length is 2L.
So we can certainly put all of those together.
But they've got to be the same.
It's a steady state process.
So P of A has got to be P of D.
So we can equate these two equations to each other.
And then the K's are going to cancel, the A's are going to cancel, the L's are going to cancel,
and we're just going to be left with T4 as an unknown.
And then it's easy to solve for T4, which is negative 8 degrees Celsius.
But the crux of the matter is the fact that P conductive across both of these,
the pine and the brick wall, has got to be equal to each other in a steady state.
Convection we can quickly look at.
There's no problems in convection.
But let's say occurs when a fluid or gas or liquid comes into contact with an object with a higher temperature.
The temperature of a part of the fluid in close proximity to the object expands and becomes less dense.
Okay, so it occurs when a fluid, which is, remember not solids, only gases and liquids,
come into contact with an object with a higher temperature.
Because the fluid is now lighter than the surrounding fluid, less dense, it rises by a buoyant force.
And the surrounding cooler fluid takes the place of the displaced fluid and the process continues.
Two good examples.
Glider pilots look for convection currents, thermal currents.
And energy produced in the core of the sun reaches the surface by rising convection cells.
Lastly, we're going to look at radiation as a heat transfer mechanism.
There's a transfer of heat by electromagnetic wave. No medium is required.
So, there's no ether, although who knows, one day the ether might make a comeback.
Anyway, for now, Mickelson and Morley showed us there's no ether.
Transfer of energy by electromagnetic wave.
The rate at which an object radiates thermal energy, P radiative, is proportional to its surface area
and the temperature T of that area in Kelvins.
And there we have, let me write it out a bit larger.
P radiative equals sigma, epsilon, area, temperature in Kelvin to the power of 4.
What is the sigma?
Sigma is the Stefan-Baltzmann constant.
And you see the value there.
5.6703 times 10 to the power negative 8 watts per square meter per Kelvin to the power of 4.
E is the emissivity constant.
Let's look at that.
The emissivity constant ranges from 0 to 1.
With 0 being no emission.
So, there's no electromagnetic radiation.
And 1 being 100% radiation.
So, that's an object with an emissivity of 1 being what we call the idealized black body radiator.
Now, radiation is also absorbed from the environment.
An idealized black body radiator will absorb all the energy it intercepts.
It's not going to scatter some of it away.
But it's then also going to irradiate.
It's also going to have an emission of 1.
Emissivity constant of 1.
So, P absorption is this again.
Sigma is Stefan-Baltzmann constant.
Emissivity, area, temperature this time of the environment.
Because it's going to take energy from the environment.
Absorb energy from the environment.
In Kelvins also to the power of 4.
So, the net transfer of thermal energy is just going to be P absorption minus P radiation.
If we take out sigma and epsilon and area as common factors.
We're going to have T environment to the power of 4.
Minus T to the power of 4 of the object itself.
So, that's radiation.
Let's put most of the things that we've learned in this video series, in this chapter together.
The system is taken from states, from the initial state to the final state.
Along either paths are A or B.
So, IAF or IBF.
Along IAF, Q is 50.
The heat transfers 50 calories and work is 20 calories.
Now, very easy.
Remember, change in internal energy by first law of thermodynamics equals Q minus W.
And that is going to be 50 minus 20.
And that's 30.
Right where we have this.
So, that's 30 calories right then then.
No matter which path we take.
Q minus W for one specific initial and final state is always going to be a constant.
So, whether we go by IAF or by IBF, it's going to be 30.
Now, we ask calculate work done on path IBF.
If Q along this path, path is 36.
Okay, but we still know that change in internal energy equals Q minus W.
So, if you get W, that is work on its own.
It's going to be Q minus delta E internal.
And that's what we have there.
36 because E transfer by this path of 36 minus the change in internal energy,
which is always going to be a constant for this specific initial and final state.
So, that leaves us with 6 calories.
Calculate Q for path FI, if work along this path, is negative 13.
Why is it negative 13?
Because this is a pressure volume curve.
And now we're going from final to initial.
In other words, our volume is going to decrease.
And remember, that gives us negative work.
So, we asked for Q and it's easy enough to get Q on its own.
That's going to be delta E internal plus W.
So, delta E internal going in that direction.
What we know still is negative 30 calories.
Because remember now, this is going in the opposite direction.
Added to that work, which we were told is negative 13.
If we add that, we end up with negative 43.
Remember now, why this was negative.
Why this was negative 30.
The change in internal energy.
Because we went from final state to initial state.
So, that's the opposite of change from going from I to F.
And then lastly, if initial energy is 10 calories.
Calculate the final internal energy.
Remember from the first law of thermodynamics.
E internal, there we go.
Change in internal energy equals final internal energy minus initial internal energy.
Simple algebra, get final internal energy on its own.
We know that the change in internal energy was 30.
And we know delta E internal, we are told you it's 10.
Sorry, that should be 10, 1, 0.
So, 30 plus 10 gives us 40 calories.
An easy, easy problem.
A cylindrical copper rod of length 1.2 meters and cross sectional area of 4.8 times 10 to the power negative 4 square meter.
Is insulated to prevent heat loss from its surface.
The ends are maintained at a temperature difference of 100 degrees by placing one end in a water ice mixture.
And the other in a water steam mixture.
Calculate the rate of thermal energy conduction through the rod.
Calculate the rate at which the ice melts.
Now this is a nice, interesting one.
First of all, calculate the rate of thermal energy conduction through the rod.
We know an equation for thermal energy conduction.
Thermal energy conduction equals.
K, a change in temperature.
Remember hot minus cold divided by L.
There we have K for copper.
The area we are given.
We are given the change in temperature.
We are given the length.
So 16 joule per second is our answer.
Now it says calculate the rate at which the ice melts.
At what rate does ice melt?
Well that's our constant for phase change.
But this is for fusion.
Because we are going from a solid to a liquid.
And for water, that's 3.33 times 10 to the power 5 joule per kilogram.
That will be given to you.
But look now again just at the dimension.
We have a conduction rate of 16 joules per second.
Okay.
And we know water will melt.
The phase change.
Ice will melt.
That is our phase change.
So if we have that in our denominator.
The joules will cancel out.
The per kilogram from the denominator goes up.
And will be kilogram per second.
So 16 joules per second divided by 3.33 times 10 to the power 5 joules per kilogram.
Is going to give you 4.8 times 10 to the power negative 5.
Kilogram per second is going to melt.
Easy.
Last problem.
Short one.
Calculate the rate of energy loss in watts per square meter.
Through a glass window.
That is what looks like 3 millimeters thick.
If the temperature difference across it is 33 degrees Celsius.
Or 33 Kelvin.
Now once again this is just going to end up being a problem of dimensions.
We have our equation for thermal energy conduction.
Or heat conduction as a heat transfer mechanism.
K times A times delta T divided by L.
We know what K is for glass.
And it will be given in the textbook or in the exams.
1.0 watts per meter per Kelvin.
Area we don't know.
Just leave area there on its own.
Just leave it as a symbol A.
And we have 33 Kelvin over 0.003 meters.
If we divide what's going to happen.
Watts will remain.
We have meter in the denominator per meter.
And in the numerator another meter.
So that will become per square meter.
Times area.
So if this has to be expressed.
In watts per square meter.
Then we have watts per square meter.
Okay.
That is not P conductive.
Because we still have to have area.
And if I have so many x square meter.
That square meter and that per square meter is going to cancel out.
And then we will get joules per second.
Which is the watt.
But we are not asked that.
We are not asked this part.
And we certainly not asked that.
We just want this expression in watts per square meter.
So just leave that A there.
Leave that A there.
But that will be the watts per square meter.
Part of this full equation here.
But that is the answer.
That the problem.
That the problem required.
Okay.
That's the last video for this section.
On temperature heat.
And heat transfer mechanisms.
Or the first law of thermodynamics.
Or the first law of thermodynamics.
fans or people are going to calm down.
The same thing for me.
