The text describes how to interfere two waves with different amplitudes using phasors (spelled as "phasols" in the text). Phasors are vectors used to represent traveling waves, where each vectorâ€™s magnitude is equal to the wave's amplitude and rotates at a specific angular frequency. Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Setup**: Two waves travel along the same medium with identical angular frequencies and wave numbers but different amplitudes.

2. **Phasor Representation**: Each wave can be represented as a phasor (vector) in a coordinate system, rotating at an angular frequency \(\omega\). The phase difference between these vectors is denoted by \(\phi\).

3. **Combining Phasors**:
   - If the phase angle \(\phi\) is positive, one vector lags behind the other.
   - If \(\phi\) is negative, it leads the other.
   - Vectorially add the two phasors to find the resultant wave (amplitude and phase).

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Two waves with amplitudes 4 mm and 3 mm, and a phase angle of \(\pi/3\), are considered.
   - The phasors are drawn: the first vector on the x-axis at 4 mm and the second offset by \(\pi/3\) radians.
   - Decompose each phasor into x and y components using cosine and sine functions, respectively:
     - \(y_{r,x} = 4 + 3 \cdot \cos(\pi/3) \approx 5.50 \text{ mm}\)
     - \(y_{r,y} = 0 + 3 \cdot \sin(\pi/3) \approx 2.6 \text{ mm}\)
   - Calculate the resultant amplitude using Pythagoras' theorem:
     - \(y_r = \sqrt{(5.50)^2 + (2.6)^2} \approx 6.1 \text{ mm}\)

The resultant wave's amplitude is approximately 6.1 mm, and this method effectively illustrates how phasors help in understanding the interference of waves with different amplitudes.

The text describes a process for determining an angle, referred to as "beta," using vector addition and trigonometry. Here's a summary:

1. The author mentions measurements resulting in a length of 6.1 mm from components 5.5 mm (x-direction) and 2.6 mm (y-direction).

2. To find the angle beta, they use the tangent function: 
   \[
   \tan(\beta) = \frac{\text{resultant in y direction}}{\text{resultant in x direction}} = \frac{2.6}{5.5}
   \]

3. Beta is calculated using the arctangent (inverse tangent) of this ratio, resulting in approximately 0.44 radians.

4. The text explains that aligning the leading vector on the x-axis simplifies calculating beta through vector addition, allowing for easy determination of resultant components and angle.

5. Finally, the author outlines how to express the resultant wave equation in terms of these components: using the calculated y-resultant, a common wave number \( k \), angular frequency \( \omega \), and adding the phase angle beta.

The process emphasizes simplicity in calculating angles through vector decomposition and trigonometric functions, culminating in a standard form for expressing resultant wave equations.
