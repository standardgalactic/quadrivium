Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy occurs in about 1 to 4 per thousand women, with Graves' disease accounting for over 85-90% of cases. Other causes include toxic adenomas, multinodular goiters, subacute thyroiditis, exogenous thyroxine intake, and hydatidiform molar disease. During early pregnancy, increased HCG can lead to gestational thyrotoxicosis, characterized by elevated T4 and suppressed TSH levels, potentially causing severe nausea and vomiting known as hypermesis gravidarum. However, a direct causal link with elevated T4 is not established.

Treatment for gestational thyrotoxicosis is generally not recommended unless symptoms persist beyond 20 weeks, indicating other causes of hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease can present as new or worsening cases during pregnancy, often improving in the second trimester but potentially deteriorating postpartum. Diagnosis involves suppressed TSH and elevated T4 levels, with most patients having TSH receptor antibodies; however, scintigraphy is contraindicated.

Untreated hyperthyroidism increases risks of preterm labor, preeclampsia, miscarriage, growth retardation, and congenital malformations (not related to thionamides). Adequate management significantly reduces these complications. The next segment will discuss managing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.
