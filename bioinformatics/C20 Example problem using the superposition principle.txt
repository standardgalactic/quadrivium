Let's have a look at this problem. Non-homogeneous, linear, third order, ordinary differential
equation, constant coefficients. It's going to have an answer in two forms, in as much,
well not two forms I should say, but why it's going to have two components, this general solution,
a particular and a complementary in a particular part. So first of all for the complementary part
we need to change this into a homogeneous equation y prime prime prime minus three y prime prime plus
three y prime minus y equals zero. Again constant coefficient, linear, third order, ordinary
differential equation, homogeneous. I'm going to make use of the auxiliary equation which is going
to be m cubed minus three m squared plus three m minus one equals zero and that is this m minus one
cubed. You can check that for yourself. Look at the graph here we have of this auxiliary equation
and certainly it has an x-intercept of one. You can also just look at this and see if can you think
of a value for m that's going to satisfy that certainly m equals one because one minus three
plus three minus one would equal zero and if m equals one then m minus one equals zero. That's equivalent
to support the m on that side. So if I take m minus one and I divide it into m cubed minus three m squared plus
three m minus one. If I did that long division I was going to be left with m squared minus two m plus one,
which I can then find the roots of as well. But we will have m sub one equals one, m sub two equals one,
and m sub three equals one. In other words my complementary solution is going to be c sub one e to the power
x plus c sub two x e to the power x plus c sub three x squared e to the power x. For the particular part I am
left with this superposition of equations x minus four e to the power x. Two separate parts.
x is a polynomial of first order so that'll have to be a x plus b for this y sub p1. Y sub p2 is a bit
different. That's e to the power x. Where does this x squared come from suddenly? That popped out of nowhere.
e to the power x. So that is going to be plus c e to the power x. If we look if I take a x and I
divided it into each of these there won't be a constant left. So a x is not a constant a constant
multiple of one of these. b is not a constant multiple of any of these. c is a constant multiple
of that because if I divide this into that the e to the power x disappears. So it's c sub one
divided by c or the other way down doesn't matter and that's a constant. If I put an x in there
it'll just be a constant multiple of that. If I put an x squared it'll be a constant multiple of that.
So I'll have to go to x cubed. So for this not to have a constant multiple in one of those.
So that's going to be my y sub p. I need to get y sub p prime which is just going to be x plus
this is the product of two functions in x. I've got to use the product rule. I don't have to use
the chain rule because well I should but there's a constant coefficient of one. So it's going to be
three c x squared e to the power x plus c x cubed e to the power x. I have to get y sub p prime prime.
That is just going to be... did I do that correctly? What a fascinating answer x. That's a.
So I have to do this one six c x e to the power x plus three c x squared e to the power x plus
three c x squared e to the power x plus c x cubed e to the power x. If I neaten it up I'm going to be
left with six c x e to the power x plus six c x squared e to the power x. That's for that two.
The c x cubed e to the power x. I have to get y sub p prime prime prime. So that is going to be six c e to the power x plus
six c x e to the power x plus six c x squared e to the power x plus three c x squared e to the power x plus
c x cubed e to the power x. And now we just need to have to neaten this up. And that's going to leave me
it looks like a c x e to the power x for that one. There's a six plus 12 is 18 c x e to the power x for
those two. That is plus nine um yeah nine c x squared e to the power x for those two. And a c x cubed e to
the power x for that one. So they're all there. So let's have a look. I have to have this minus
the three times that plus three times that minus that. Minus that one I should say. Okay let's do
that. These become a bit long and laborious but what can you do? So I'm going to have the fact that
six c e to the power x plus 18 c x e to the power x plus nine c x squared e to the power x plus c x cubed e
to the power x. Minus three times this. So negative three there. So it's going to be minus 18 c x e to the power x
minus 18 c x squared e to the power x minus three c x cubed e to the power x. Then I've got to have
plus three of plus three of this. So it's going to be positive three a positive nine c x squared e to
the power x positive three c x cubed e to the power x minus this one. So minus a x minus b minus c x cubed e
to the power x and that is going to equal x minus four e to the power x. Let's see where that leaves us.
I think there is a six c e to the power x. There's no other e to the power x's there. Let's look at 18 c x
just the x to the power one. So there's 18 of those c x c x c x minus 18. So there's nothing left x squared x
squared x squared x squared x squared. So those are exhausted. 9 x squared minus 18 x squared leaves me
with minus 9 x squared positive 9 x squared e to the power x. So there's nothing left of those. And
that's how it usually works because we chose correctly. C x cubed minus three c that's negative two that we are
left with. There's positive one we are left with. There's positive one we are left with. Minus one nothing
left with there. Then we're going to have a positive three a positive three a minus b for our constant
there and a minus a x there. So they're all all being used up collectively exhaustive there. So what are we
left with? We are left with the fact that negative a x equals x. And divide both sides. So a equals negative one.
Now there's no constant on this side so I can put zero there. So three a minus b equals zero.
In other words b equals three times a. In other words b equals three times negative one. That is negative three.
And six c e to the power x seems to equal negative four e to the power x. Those two go. In other words
six c equals negative four and c equals negative two over three. In other words y is going to equal c sub one.
Look at what I've done. You can't see what I've done there. Just the usual thing.
e to the power x has got to be that. The constants have got to be that. This has got to be that.
And just worked it out. So it's c sub one e to the power x plus c sub two e x sorry e to the power
x plus c sub three. I cannot see again. Let's use that time to meter this one. It's terrible. So I'm just
putting a complementary solution there. c three x squared e to the power x. Now a is negative one. So it's going to be
negative one x. b is negative three. So negative three. And c is negative two thirds. So negative two over
three x cubed e to the power x. There is our solution. General solution. Beautiful.
