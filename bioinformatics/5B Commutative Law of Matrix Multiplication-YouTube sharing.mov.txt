Now for a closer look at the commutative law of multiplication.
We will consider three examples.
In the first A is a 2 by 3 matrix and B is a 3 by 4 matrix.
AB will be a 2 by 4 matrix.
Remember that the number of columns in the first matrix must be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix.
In this case that will be 3 and 3.
What is left is the 2 and the 4.
So the resultant matrix is a 2 by 4 matrix.
Note though that BA is not defined.
In this case the number of columns in the first matrix, which is now B, is 4.
And the number of rows in the second matrix is 2.
4 and 2 are not the same and the matrices cannot be multiplied in this order.
Secondly, both AB and BA can be defined but they are not the same size.
Here we have a matrix A of 2 by 3 and a matrix B of 3 by 2.
AB is defined and will be a 2 by 2 matrix and BA will be a 3 by 3 matrix.
Lastly, both AB and BA can be defined and even have the same size but they may still be different.
Here we have a matrix A of size 2 by 2 and these elements.
A matrix B also of size 2 by 2 and of these elements.
AB and BA will both be of size 2 by 2 but let's look at the values.
As you can see both AB and BA are defined and they are the same size but they are definitely not equal.
