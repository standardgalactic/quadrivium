This lecture covers how to use Seaborn, a data visualization library in Python that enhances plot aesthetics for publication-ready visuals. It works with Matplotlib and is compatible across Linux (e.g., Mint 17.1), macOS, and Windows systems.

For installation:

1. Use the Terminal on Linux/macOS or Command Prompt on Windows.
2. Ensure Python is installed via Anaconda version 3.4, which includes PIP, necessary for installing modules like Seaborn.
3. If using a non-Anaconda Python setup without PIP, set up PIP separately.

To install Seaborn:

- Run `pip install seaborn` in your terminal or command prompt. You might need administrator privileges and a password.
  
The process automates the download and setup of Seaborn once these steps are completed.
