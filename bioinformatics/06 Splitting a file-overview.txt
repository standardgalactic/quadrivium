The text outlines a process for splitting a dataset based on a categorical variable and analyzing descriptive statistics of a numerical variable within those groups. Specifically, it demonstrates using software to separate patient data into two groups: those who survived and those who died, focusing on age statistics for each group.

1. **Splitting the File**: The video tutorial shows how to split a file by a categorical variable (e.g., survival status) to facilitate comparative analysis between different groups.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**: After splitting, descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation are calculated separately for each group.

3. **Visualization**: A box plot is used to visually compare the age distributions of the two groups.

4. **Reverting Changes**: The tutorial emphasizes reverting the file back to its original state after analysis to avoid unintended data splits in future analyses.

The process highlights an easy method for splitting files by categorical variables, with a note that more complex methods (like using ranges within numerical variables) are also possible. However, it is crucial to undo the split afterward to maintain the integrity of subsequent analyses.
