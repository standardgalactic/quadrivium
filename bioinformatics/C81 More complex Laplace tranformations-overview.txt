The text discusses an efficient method for finding the Laplace transform when multiplying a function \( f(t) \) by an exponential term \( e^{at} \). This method leverages operational properties to simplify calculations. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Basic Concept**: If you know the Laplace transform of \( f(t) \), and you multiply \( f(t) \) by \( e^{at} \), instead of recalculating from scratch, you can modify the existing transform.

2. **Operational Property**: The key property is that multiplying \( f(t) \) by \( e^{at} \) corresponds to replacing every instance of \( s \) in the Laplace transform of \( f(t) \) with \( s-a \).

3. **Example Provided**:
   - Given: Find the Laplace transform of \( e^{3t} \cdot t^3 \).
   - Known: The Laplace transform of \( t^3 \) is \( \frac{6}{s^4} \).
   - Apply the property: Replace \( s \) with \( s-3 \), resulting in the transform \( \frac{6}{(s-3)^4} \).

This approach avoids complex integration, simplifying the process significantly by using a straightforward substitution.
