I want to take some time in this lecture just to talk about who I think might benefit from this
lecture series. I really want to divide the audience or the possible audience into two groups.
Now let's look at the first world. Money exists. Research has been done for a long time. Structures
are in place. Now an entry into a first world research system such as that might be a tad difficult.
It's good when you enter a system like that to have as much knowledge as possible. On the other hand
we have the third world where we don't have so many systems, where we don't have the money to do this
research. But in many instances we sit with an abundance of data. Data to answer many of the
research questions that are out there. It's important in these sort of circumstances also
to have good knowledge about research. Now what are the aims? Well to do research I think you must have
a burning question. A question must exist in your mind and you want an answer to that question. Of
course your first step is to go to the literature. Look at what others have done. What answers are out
there? If you do not find the answer or you feel that you can contribute to that research question,
it's time for you to look at your data and gather some data. Now there's a lot of stuff you have to
consider. A lot of logistical information that you have to think about. What variables are you going to
choose? They must be chosen so that they answer your research question. They must be accurate. It must be
reproducible. And if human beings are involved you've got to consider ethics. You have to protect your
patient's identity when you gather data. And then it's time to analyze the data. And this is what this
lecture series is all about. I hope you enjoy it.
