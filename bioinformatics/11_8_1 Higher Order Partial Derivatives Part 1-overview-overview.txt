The text explains the process of computing higher-order partial derivatives for functions with multiple variables by comparing it to single-variable derivatives. It starts by outlining notation and computation methods, using examples to clarify these concepts.

For a multivariable function \( f(x, y) \), first-order partial derivatives are denoted as \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \). Higher-order derivatives, such as second or third order, are computed by differentiating sequentially with respect to the same variable (e.g., \( d_1^2 f \)).

The text introduces mixed partial derivatives, like \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \), and explains that under certain conditions (existence and continuity of second-order partials), these are equal, as per Clairaut's theorem. An example with the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) demonstrates how to find all second-order derivatives.

A specific example given is \( f(x, y) = \sin(3x - 2y) \), where first and second-order partial derivatives are computed:
- First-order: \( f_x = 3\cos(3x - 2y) \), \( f_y = -2\cos(3x - 2y) \).
- Second-order: Mixed derivatives \( f_{xy} = f_{yx} = -6\sin(3x - 2y) \) (confirming Clairaut's theorem), and pure second-order derivatives \( f_{xx} = -9\sin(3x - 2y) \), \( f_{yy} = -4\sin(3x - 2y) \).

The text concludes by noting that beyond certain orders, especially when derivatives become zero, further differentiation becomes unnecessary. Typically, only a few orders of partial derivatives are used in practical problems.
