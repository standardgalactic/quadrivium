The text explains how to use the ratio and root tests to determine whether a series converges or diverges by examining specific limits. Here's a summary of the key points:

### Ratio Test:
- **Definition**: The ratio test involves finding the limit \( L \) as \( n \) approaches infinity of the absolute value of consecutive terms in a series.
  - If \( L < 1 \), the series converges absolutely.
  - If \( L > 1 \) (or is infinite), the series diverges.
  - If \( L = 1 \), the test is inconclusive, and other methods are needed.

- **Examples**:
  1. **Example Series**: For terms given by \((-1)^k \cdot k / 2^k\), the ratio test gives \( L = 0.5 \). Since this is less than 1, the series converges absolutely.
  2. **Factorial Series**: With terms like \((k+1)! / e^{k+1}\), the ratio test results in \( L = \infty \), indicating divergence.

### Root Test:
- Similar to the ratio test, the root test evaluates:
  - If \( L < 1 \), the series converges absolutely.
  - If \( L > 1 \) (or is infinite), it diverges.
  - If \( L = 1 \), further analysis is required.

### Application of Tests on a Specific Expression:
- The text analyzes the convergence of an expression using limits:

\[
\left( \frac{2K + 4}{|5K - 1|} \right)^K
\]

- Simplifying \( |5K - 1| \) to \( 5K - 1 \) for \( K \geq 1 \), it reduces the expression to:

\[
\left( \frac{2K + 4}{5K - 1} \right)^K
\]

- By evaluating:

\[
\lim_{K \to \infty} \frac{2K + 4}{5K - 1}
\]

- Dividing both the numerator and denominator by \( K \):

\[
\lim_{K \to \infty} \frac{2 + \frac{4}{K}}{5 - \frac{1}{K}} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

- Since \( \frac{2}{5} < 1 \), the series converges absolutely.

Overall, these tests help in determining the behavior of series by evaluating specific limits.
