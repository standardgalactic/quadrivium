The text describes a mathematical exercise focused on vector norms in Euclidean space. The primary objective is to show that scaling a vector by the reciprocal of its norm results in a unit vector, which has a norm of 1.

### Key Steps:

1. **Norm and Scaling:**
   - For a given vector \( \mathbf{V} = (V_1, V_2, V_3) \), calculate its Euclidean norm:
     \[
     \| \mathbf{V} \| = \sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}
     \]
   - Scale the vector by \( \frac{1}{\| \mathbf{V} \|} \), resulting in a new vector:
     \[
     \left( \frac{V_1}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}}, \frac{V_2}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}}, \frac{V_3}{\sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}} \right)
     \]
   - Calculate the norm of this new vector:
     \[
     \sqrt{\left(\frac{V_1}{\| \mathbf{V} \|}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{V_2}{\| \mathbf{V} \|}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{V_3}{\| \mathbf{V} \|}\right)^2}
     \]
   - Simplifying, this results in:
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2}} = \sqrt{1} = 1
     \]
   - This confirms that scaling a vector by the reciprocal of its norm results in a unit vector.

2. **Scalar Calculation:**
   - For \( \mathbf{V} = (-2, 3, 0, 6) \), find scalar \( K \) such that:
     \[
     \| K \mathbf{V} \| = 5
     \]
   - Compute the norm of \( \mathbf{V} \):
     \[
     \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
     \]
   - Solve for \( K \) in the equation:
     \[
     |K| \times 7 = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |K| = \frac{5}{7}
     \]
   - Thus, \( K = \pm \frac{5}{7} \).

The exercise illustrates concepts of vector normalization and scalar manipulation within Euclidean space.
