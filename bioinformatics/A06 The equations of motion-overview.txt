The text explains how to calculate the cross product of two vectors, \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \), in a three-dimensional space using their components. 

Given:
- Vector \( \mathbf{A} = (3, -2, 0) \)
- Vector \( \mathbf{B} = (1, 2, 0) \)

The cross product is determined by the following steps:

1. **Direction**: Use the right-hand rule to determine that the resultant vector (\( \mathbf{C} \)) will point out of the plane, in the positive z-direction.

2. **Matrix Setup**:
   - Construct a 3x3 matrix with unit vectors \( \mathbf{i}, -\mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} \) as the first row.
   - The second and third rows are the components of \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \), respectively:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \mathbf{i} & -\mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
     3 & -2 & 0 \\
     1 & 2 & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Determinant Calculation**:
   - Calculate the determinant along the first row to find each component of \( \mathbf{C} \).
   - For the \( \mathbf{i} \) component: 
     \[
     (-2)(0) - (0)(2) = 0
     \]
   - For the \( \mathbf{j} \) component:
     \[
     (3)(0) - (0)(1) = 0
     \]
   - For the \( \mathbf{k} \) component:
     \[
     (3)(2) - (-2)(1) = 6 + 2 = 8
     \]

4. **Result**: The cross product \( \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = (0, 0, 8) \).

The resultant vector \( \mathbf{C} \) is \( 8\mathbf{k} \), indicating it points out of the plane with a magnitude of 8. This process can be applied to any vectors in three-dimensional space by setting up a similar matrix and calculating the determinant along the first row.

The text describes how to calculate the cross product of two vectors \( \mathbf{A} = (3, -2) \) and \( \mathbf{B} = (1, 2) \), which are initially in a two-dimensional space. To perform the cross product operation in three dimensions, it treats these vectors as having no z-component, i.e., \( \mathbf{A} = (3, -2, 0) \) and \( \mathbf{B} = (1, 2, 0) \).

### Steps to Find the Cross Product:

1. **Direction Determination**: 
   - Use the right-hand rule: point your fingers in the direction of vector \( \mathbf{A} \), then curl them towards vector \( \mathbf{B} \). Your thumb points in the direction of the cross product, which is along the positive z-axis (out of the plane).

2. **Matrix Setup**: 
   - Set up a 3x3 matrix using unit vectors \( \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} \) in the first row and components of vectors \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) in the second and third rows:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \mathbf{i} & -\mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
     3 & -2 & 0 \\
     1 & 2 & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Determinant Calculation**:
   - Calculate the determinant along the first row to find each component of the cross product:
     - \( i \)-component: 
       \[
       (-2)(0) - (0)(2) = 0
       \]
     - \( j \)-component:
       \[
       -(3(0) - 0(1)) = 0
       \]
     - \( k \)-component:
       \[
       (3)(2) - (-2)(1) = 6 + 2 = 8
       \]

4. **Result**:
   - The cross product \( \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} \) is \( (0, 0, 8) \).

The text explains that this process can be generalized to find the angular momentum \( \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} \) in three-dimensional space by using similar matrix setup and determinant calculation. The result of this particular cross product indicates a vector pointing out of the plane with magnitude 8 along the z-axis.
