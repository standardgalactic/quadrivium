The text provides an explanation on deriving Hamilton’s equation from Lagrangian mechanics using calculus and physics principles. Here is a summary:

1. **Granger's Equation**: The process begins with Granger's equation involving derivatives of the Lagrangian \( L \) with respect to generalized coordinates \( Q \) and velocities \( \dot{Q} \).

2. **Calculus Application**: Using basic calculus, it is shown that for a function \( f(x, y, t) \), its total derivative can be expressed in terms of partial derivatives multiplied by their respective rates (e.g., velocity \( \dot{x} \)).

3. **Lagrangian Expression**: The Lagrangian \( L(q, \dot{q}, t) \) is considered a function of generalized coordinates \( q \), velocities \( \dot{q} \), and time \( t \). The differential form involves these variables.

4. **Simplification**: Through manipulation, the expression involving derivatives simplifies to equate changes in momentum with changes in energy terms.

5. **Time Independence Prerequisite**: For Hamilton's equation to be derived, it is necessary that the Lagrangian \( L \) does not explicitly depend on time (\( t \)). This ensures no hidden time dependencies affect the system.

6. **Hamiltonian Definition**: If the Lagrangian has no explicit time dependence, the expression simplifies further, leading to the definition of Hamiltonian \( H \). The Hamiltonian is found to be equal to total energy (kinetic plus potential) when there are no hidden degrees of freedom related to time.

7. **Conclusion**: Under these conditions, the Hamiltonian represents the total energy of the system and is expressed as a combination of kinetic and potential energies: 
   \[
   H = T + V = \frac{1}{2}M\dot{Q}^2 + V(Q)
   \]
where \( M \) is mass, \( \dot{Q} \) is velocity, and \( V(Q) \) is the potential energy.

This summary encapsulates the process of transitioning from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics in classical physics.

The text outlines the process of deriving Hamilton’s equations from Lagrangian mechanics. Here's a summary:

1. **Starting Point**: The discussion begins with Granger's equation and uses calculus to express derivatives. Specifically, it involves expressing the total derivative \( df/dt \) in terms of partial derivatives.

2. **Lagrangian Mechanics**: The text introduces the Lagrangian \( L \), defined as a function of generalized coordinates \( q \), velocities \( \dot{q} \), and time \( t \). It states that the differential form is:
   \[
   dL = \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q}\right) dq + \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\right) d\dot{q} + \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}\right) dt
   \]

3. **Derivation Steps**:
   - The text aims to simplify the expression by bringing all time derivatives \( d/dt \) on one side.
   - It assumes no explicit time dependence in \( L \) (i.e., \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = 0 \)) for simplification, leading to a constant Hamiltonian.

4. **Hamiltonian Formulation**:
   - The Hamiltonian \( H \) is defined as:
     \[
     H = \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\right) \dot{q} - L
     \]
   - This expression simplifies to the total energy \( H = T + V \), where \( T \) is kinetic energy and \( V \) is potential energy, under the assumption of no explicit time dependence.

5. **Conclusion**: The Hamiltonian represents the total energy of the system when there are no hidden dependencies on time in the Lagrangian. This derivation hinges on the condition that \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = 0 \), ensuring that the Hamiltonian is conserved and equals the total energy of the system.

The text effectively connects the concepts of Lagrangian mechanics to Hamiltonian mechanics, emphasizing conditions under which the Hamiltonian equals the total energy.
