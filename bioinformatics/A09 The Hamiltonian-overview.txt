The text provides an explanation on deriving Hamiltonâ€™s equation from Lagrangian mechanics using calculus and physics principles. Here is a summary:

1. **Granger's Equation**: The process begins with Granger's equation involving derivatives of the Lagrangian \( L \) with respect to generalized coordinates \( Q \) and velocities \( \dot{Q} \).

2. **Calculus Application**: Using basic calculus, it is shown that for a function \( f(x, y, t) \), its total derivative can be expressed in terms of partial derivatives multiplied by their respective rates (e.g., velocity \( \dot{x} \)).

3. **Lagrangian Expression**: The Lagrangian \( L(q, \dot{q}, t) \) is considered a function of generalized coordinates \( q \), velocities \( \dot{q} \), and time \( t \). The differential form involves these variables.

4. **Simplification**: Through manipulation, the expression involving derivatives simplifies to equate changes in momentum with changes in energy terms.

5. **Time Independence Prerequisite**: For Hamilton's equation to be derived, it is necessary that the Lagrangian \( L \) does not explicitly depend on time (\( t \)). This ensures no hidden time dependencies affect the system.

6. **Hamiltonian Definition**: If the Lagrangian has no explicit time dependence, the expression simplifies further, leading to the definition of Hamiltonian \( H \). The Hamiltonian is found to be equal to total energy (kinetic plus potential) when there are no hidden degrees of freedom related to time.

7. **Conclusion**: Under these conditions, the Hamiltonian represents the total energy of the system and is expressed as a combination of kinetic and potential energies: 
   \[
   H = T + V = \frac{1}{2}M\dot{Q}^2 + V(Q)
   \]
where \( M \) is mass, \( \dot{Q} \) is velocity, and \( V(Q) \) is the potential energy.

This summary encapsulates the process of transitioning from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics in classical physics.
