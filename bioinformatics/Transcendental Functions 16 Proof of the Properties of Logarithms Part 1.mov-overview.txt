The text presents a proof for the logarithmic identity \(\ln(ax) = \ln(a) + \ln(x)\), where \(a\) is a constant and \(x > 0\). The proof utilizes Corollary 2 of the Mean Value Theorem, which states that if two functions have equal derivatives over an interval, then they differ by a constant.

Here's a summary of the proof:

1. **Derivatives Comparison**: 
   - Compute the derivative of \(\ln(ax)\) using the chain rule: \(d/dx [\ln(ax)] = 1/x\).
   - Compute the derivative of \(\ln(x)\): \(d/dx [\ln(x)] = 1/x\).

2. **Application of Mean Value Theorem**: 
   - Since both derivatives are equal (\(f'(x) = g'(x) = 1/x\)), by Corollary 2, \(\ln(ax) = \ln(x) + c\) for some constant \(c\).

3. **Determine the Constant**:
   - Evaluate at \(x = 1\): \(\ln(a \cdot 1) = \ln(1) + c\).
   - Simplify: \(\ln(a) = 0 + c\), so \(c = \ln(a)\).

4. **Final Identity**:
   - Substitute back to get \(\ln(ax) = \ln(x) + \ln(a)\), which can be rewritten as \(\ln(ax) = \ln(a) + \ln(x)\).

This proof confirms the logarithmic property using calculus principles.
