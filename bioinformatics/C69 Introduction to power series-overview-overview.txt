The text explains that power series are used to solve differential equations and are expressed as an infinite sum around a point \( x = a \):

\[ y = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n (x-a)^n \]

where \( c_n \) are constants specific to each term. Differentiating the power series term by term yields:

\[ y' = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n c_n (x-a)^{n-1} \]

A key feature of power series is their interval and radius of convergence, within which they represent a function \( f(x) \). The ratio test helps determine this convergence, stating that:

- If the limit \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| < 1 \), the series converges absolutely.
- If \( L > 1 \), it diverges.
- If \( L = 1 \), further analysis is needed, particularly at endpoints.

Within its interval of convergence, a power series defines a function that is continuous, differentiable, and integrable. Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be conducted on these series through index shifting. A power series represents the zero function if all coefficients are zero within its interval of convergence.
