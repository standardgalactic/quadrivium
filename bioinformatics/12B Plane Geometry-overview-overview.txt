To find the equation of a plane given three points in space using vector algebra, follow these steps:

### Given Points
- \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \)
- \( P_2(2, 3, 1) \)
- \( P_3(3, -1, 2) \)

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Find Two Vectors in the Plane**: Use one point as a reference to form vectors:
   - Vector \( \mathbf{v}_1 = P_2 - P_1 = (1, 1, 2) \)
   - Vector \( \mathbf{v}_2 = P_3 - P_1 = (2, -3, 3) \)

2. **Find the Normal Vector**: Compute the cross product of \( \mathbf{v}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{v}_2 \):
   \[
   \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v}_1 \times \mathbf{v}_2 = 
   \begin{vmatrix}
   \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
   1 & 1 & 2 \\
   2 & -3 & 3
   \end{vmatrix}
   \]
   Resulting in the normal vector \( \mathbf{n} = (9, 1, -5) \).

3. **Equation of the Plane**: Use the normal vector to form the plane equation:
   \[
   9x + y - 5z = d
   \]

4. **Solve for \( d \)**: Substitute one point into the equation (using \( P_1(1, 2, -1) \)):
   \[
   9(1) + 1(2) - 5(-1) = d \\
   d = 16
   \]

### Final Equation of the Plane
The plane's equation is:
\[
9x + y - 5z = 16
\]
This equation represents the plane passing through points \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \).
