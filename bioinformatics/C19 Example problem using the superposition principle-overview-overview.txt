The text outlines the process of solving a differential equation with a complementary and particular solution:

1. **Complementary Function**: 
   - Begin with a homogeneous differential equation (\( g(x) = 0 \)).
   - Solve the auxiliary characteristic equation \( m^2 - m + 1 = 0 \), yielding complex conjugate roots: \( m = \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \).
   - The complementary function is:
     \[
     y_c = e^{\frac{x}{2}}(c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x))
     \]

2. **Particular Solution**: 
   - Given the non-homogeneous term \( g(x) = 2\sin(3x) \), assume a particular solution:
     \[
     y_p = a \cos(3x) + b \sin(3x)
     \]
   - Differentiate and substitute into the differential equation to determine coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).

3. **Solving for Coefficients**: 
   - Derive equations by matching coefficients of \(\cos(3x)\) and \(\sin(3x)\).
   - Solve these to find:
     \[
     a = \frac{6}{73}, \quad b = -\frac{16}{73}
     \]

4. **General Solution**: 
   - Combine the complementary and particular solutions:
     \[
     y = e^{\frac{x}{2}}(c_1 \cos(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x) + c_2 \sin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x)) + \frac{6}{73} \cos(3x) - \frac{16}{73} \sin(3x)
     \]

The text highlights the necessity of including both sine and cosine terms in the particular solution to accommodate derivatives properly. Additionally, it discusses setting an extra zero involving a cosine function to ensure equation balance or symmetry by incorporating all necessary terms.
