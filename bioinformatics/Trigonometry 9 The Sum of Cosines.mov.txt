In this video, I will demonstrate how to derive an expression for the addition and subtraction of two cosine functions.
Firstly, I'll assume that a equals x plus y and that b equals x minus y.
Through algebraic manipulation, I find that y equals a minus x,
and substituting this value of y into the second equation leaves b equals x minus a minus x.
Simplifying leaves b equals 2x minus a, and solving for x leaves x equals a plus b over 2.
Now I'll manipulate the equation so that I can express y in terms of a and b.
Originally, I had a equals x plus y. That means x equals a minus y.
Substituting this value of x into b equals x minus y leaves b equals a minus y minus y.
Solving for y leaves y equals a minus b over 2.
Now that I have four equations to express the four variables, I can write that the cosine of a equals the cosine of x plus y.
I can expand this by the trigonometric identity for the cosine of the addition of two angles.
And now the cosine of a equals the cosine of x cosine of y minus the sine of x sine of y.
Similarly, the cosine of b equals the cosine of x cosine of y minus the sine of x sine of y.
Now I can consider the sum of cosines.
Cosine a plus cosine b equals cosine x cosine y minus sine x sine y plus cosine x cosine y plus sine x sine y.
And the difference of cosines.
Cosine a minus cosine b equals cosine x cosine y minus sine x sine y minus the cosine x cosine y plus sine x sine y.
Simplifying leaves cosine a plus cosine b equals 2 cosine x cosine y.
And cosine a minus cosine b equals negative 2 sine x sine y.
If I substitute the values for x and y that I've calculated above, I get the cosine of an angle plus the cosine of a second angle equals 2 times the cosine of the addition of those two angles divided by 2 times the cosine of the difference between those two angles divided by 2.
And the cosine of an angle minus the cosine of another angle equals negative 2 times the sine of the addition of those two angles divided by 2 times the sine of the difference of those two angles divided by 2.
