The text explains how to work with vectors in a three-dimensional right-hand coordinate system using unit vectors \( \mathbf{i} \), \( \mathbf{j} \), and \( \mathbf{k} \) along the x, y, and z axes. A vector \( \mathbf{v} = (a, b, c) \) is analyzed in terms of its angles with these unit vectors: \( \alpha \) with \( \mathbf{i} \), \( \beta \) with \( \mathbf{j} \), and \( \gamma \) with \( \mathbf{k} \).

1. **Cosine of Angles**:
   - The cosine of each angle is derived from the dot product between \( \mathbf{v} \) and the unit vectors, divided by the magnitude of \( \mathbf{v} \):
     \[
     \cos(\alpha) = \frac{a}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}, \quad \cos(\beta) = \frac{b}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}, \quad \cos(\gamma) = \frac{c}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
     \]

2. **Normalized Vector**:
   - The normalized vector \( \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \) is expressed as:
     \[
     \left( \frac{a}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}, \frac{b}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}, \frac{c}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \right)
     \]
   - This indicates that the components of the normalized vector are the cosines of angles \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), and \( \gamma \).

3. **Sum of Squares of Cosines**:
   - The sum of the squares of these cosines equals 1, showing a fundamental property of direction cosines:
     \[
     \cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta) + \cos^2(\gamma) = \frac{a^2}{\|\mathbf{v}\|^2} + \frac{b^2}{\|\mathbf{v}\|^2} + \frac{c^2}{\|\mathbf{v}\|^2} = 1
     \]
   - This equality holds because \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 \).

The text demonstrates how the components of a vector relate to its direction cosines, reinforcing that the sum of the squares of these cosines is always 1 in three-dimensional space.
