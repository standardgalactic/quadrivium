The text provides an overview of esophageal physiology and diagnostic methods. The esophagus's primary role is transporting food and drink from the mouth to the stomach through swallowing, aided by voluntary actions like tongue movement and involuntary peristaltic waves. Swallowing involves mechanisms such as closing nasal passages with the soft palate and preventing aspiration using the epiglottis.

Peristalsis in the esophagus relies on pressure gradients: high pressure at the top and negative pressure within the thorax, facilitating bolus movement through primary waves. Secondary waves respond to obstructions or dilation, while tertiary waves are uncommon post-swelling. Mucus production by glandular structures aids lubrication and protection.

Esophageal functions are regulated by sympathetic (perivertebral chain) and parasympathetic (vagus nerve) pathways. Diagnostic approaches include contrast swallow studies using barium for imaging, water-soluble contrasts for suspected perforations, manometry to measure esophageal pressures, and pH monitoring to evaluate gastroesophageal reflux disease through acidity levels.
