The text discusses determining the conditions under which a 2x2 matrix is singular. The determinant of the matrix \( A \) is calculated as \( AD - BC \). In the example provided, both terms (\(7 \times 0\) and \(9 \times 0\)) are zero, resulting in a determinant of zero. This illustrates that if an entire row (or column) consists solely of zeros, the matrix is singular because its determinant will be zero. The new rule established here states that having a full row or column of zeros makes the matrix singular.
