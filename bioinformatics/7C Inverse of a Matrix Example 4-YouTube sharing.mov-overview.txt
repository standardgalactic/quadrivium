The text discusses determining the conditions under which a 2x2 matrix is singular. The determinant of the matrix \( A \) is calculated as \( AD - BC \). In the example provided, both terms (\(7 \times 0\) and \(9 \times 0\)) are zero, resulting in a determinant of zero. This illustrates that if an entire row (or column) consists solely of zeros, the matrix is singular because its determinant will be zero. The new rule established here states that having a full row or column of zeros makes the matrix singular.

The text explains the process of determining when a matrix is singular by examining its determinant. Specifically, it describes calculating the determinant of a 2x2 matrix using the formula \(AD - BC\). In the example given, both products (7 times 0 and 9 times 0) result in zero, leading to a determinant of zero. The conclusion drawn from this calculation is that if an entire row or column of a matrix consists solely of zeros, the determinant will be zero, indicating that the matrix is singular (i.e., it does not have an inverse). Therefore, the new rule established is: if there's a whole row or column of zeros in a matrix, the matrix is singular.
