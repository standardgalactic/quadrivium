now let's have a look at this problem we have these two differential equations x prime that's
dx dt so we're dealing with parameterized equations here that we have x of t and y of t
but so dx dt minus 2x minus 3y equals 0 and dy dt minus 2x minus y equals 0 so we've just
got to solve for x and y now we can rewrite this obviously i can bring this over to the other side
so x prime is going to be 2x plus 3y and y prime is going to be 2x plus y in other words i'm going
to have this x prime which now remember is just x prime and y prime this column vector and i can
immediately see i'm going to have this vector a which is 2 and 3 and 2 and 1 times x so i immediately
have my i've done nothing else i've just rewritten this as this in this matrix form so there's my
vector a and i need to i need to remember that the determinant of a minus lambda i is going to equal
this zero vector zero zero so let's do that we're going to have a two minus we're going to have a
two minus lambda a three a two and a one minus lambda and we need to get the determinant of this
and once we get the determinant of this the determinant's got to be zero now obviously they
shouldn't write that that must just be zero this determinant the determinant's obviously not a vector
so apologies for that if i do that every now and again just ignore that so i have two minus lambda
lambda and one minus lambda minus six that would be equal to zero and i have two minus three lambda
plus lambda squared negative six equals zero so i have lambda squared minus three lambda minus four
equals zero in other words i'm going to have a lambda plus one and a lambda minus four that's going to
equal to zero so lambda is my item values lambda sub one equals negative one and lambda sub two equals
four let's just make some space so there are my two eigenvalues for this set of linear differential
equations so let's start with lambda sub one equals negative one let's start with that let's start with
that one so again the second thing that i do have to remember is that a minus lambda i that vector
times that eigenvector has got to equal now it's going to equal the zero vector in whichever way you want
to write a vector so for negative one so this is going to be negative one times i so i'm going to have
two three three three two one and i'm going to subtract from the negative one zero zero zero negative one
and then i get two minus negative one is three three and then i'm going to get a two two so that is a minus
lambda sub one and i've got to multiply that by three three two two i'm going to multiply that by case of one
in case of two so i'm going to get three times case of one plus three times case of two is going to
equal zero and the same here two times case of one plus two times case of two equals zero and that's
quite easy to do if i just let k1 equal one that means k2 has got to equal negative one so my first
my first my first solution is going to be x sub one is going to be this eigenvector one negative one
e to the power negative one t so that is as far as lambdas of one is concerned let's look quickly at
lambdas of two if we look at lambdas of two which is four so i'm going to have two three
to one minus four zero zero four two vectors two uh two three is a two three two one minus that so two
minus was negative two three two negative three again i've got to multiply that you can call that now okay
three in case of three case of four doesn't really matter let's just call it that again so again
two times case of one minus two times case of three times case of two is going to equal zero
that is also going to equal zero it's exactly it's always going to work out to be exactly the same thing
there in other words two times case of one equals three times case of two or case of one equals three
over two case of two so if i let case of two equal to two i'm just doing the simplest one that i can
i can choose anything and that means case of one is going to equal three so my second eigenvalue
uh eigenvector here is going to be three and two three and two so x of two here is going to be
three two e to the power four t so there's two but are we done
no no remember we are dealing here
we are dealing here with we are dealing with um differential equations and i just need to make
sure that these are not constant multiples of each other and remember how to do that well
that's the wrong skin of this x sub one and x sub two in other words that's the determinant of my x sub
one is there e to the power negative t and minus e to the power negative t and here we have three e to
the power four t and two e to the power of four t i've got to get the determinant of that which would be
two e to the power three t minus the negative there is plus then three e to the power three t and
that does not equal zero if the wrong skin is not zero these two solutions are not constant multiples of
each other so i can have my final set as being c sub one x of one plus c sub two x of two remember these
when i when i did my eigenvalues my eigenvectors one negative one and three and two i just put in
any values there we don't have boundary we don't have initial values here so any constant any constant
multiplied by x sub one any constant multiplied by x sub two there if i put them together then i'm going
to only get so there's x sub one is this and there's x sub two so i can just put a c sub one
may and a c sub two there so just short end writing the final solution so remember you've got to get
the wrong skin or the determinant of of your two solutions there so that you can get the final
solution this is just to make sure they are not constant multiples of each other if they were i can
just drop that because if one is a constant multiple of of the other one i could have just put them all
just put them together and i would have had one single new constant okay so remember to do this at the end
