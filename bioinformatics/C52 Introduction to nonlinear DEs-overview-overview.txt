The text explores methods for solving non-linear differential equations, which differ from linear ones due to their involvement of powers other than one for the function and its derivatives. Unlike linear equations, these typically do not have explicit solutions but can sometimes be solved by reducing their order through substitution methods.

A common approach is to introduce a new variable \( u(x) = \frac{dy}{dx} \), transforming the second derivative into \( \frac{du}{dx} \). This allows for separation of variables and integration, making it easier to find solutions. For example, in an equation like \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 2x + (\frac{dy}{dx})^2 \), substituting \( u \) simplifies the problem.

The text differentiates between non-autonomous equations, which involve the independent variable \( x \), and autonomous ones, which do not. An example of an autonomous equation is \( y'' = (y')^2 \), solvable by separating variables after substituting \( u = y' \).

While some non-linear differential equations can be explicitly solved using these techniques, many require approximations with Taylor polynomials for solutions valid in specific regions on the x-axis. The text indicates that further discussion will cover cases where Taylor series are necessary for approximation.
