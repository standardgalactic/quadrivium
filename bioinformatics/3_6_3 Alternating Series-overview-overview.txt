The text provides an overview of determining series convergence or divergence using specific tests through examples:

1. **First Series Example:**
   - The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4(-1)^{k+1}}{\sqrt{k}}\) is analyzed as an alternating series.
   - Convergence is tested by examining the absolute value of terms, \(a_k = \frac{8}{\sqrt{k}}\).
   - The limit of \(a_k\) as \(k\) approaches infinity is 0, and it's shown that \(a_{k+1} < a_k\), confirming convergence through the Alternating Series Test.

2. **Second Series Example:**
   - The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1} 4^k}{k^2}\) is considered.
   - For \(a_k = \frac{4^k}{k^2}\), L'HÃ´pital's Rule is applied to the function \(f(x) = \frac{4^x}{x^2}\).
   - The limit as \(x\) approaches infinity is infinite, indicating that the series diverges.

3. **Error in Partial Sums:**
   - For an alternating series, the error \(|S - S_n|\) is bounded by \(a_{n+1}\).
   - To ensure the error is no more than \(\frac{1}{10,000}\), solve \(\frac{2}{n+1} \leq \frac{1}{10,000}\).
   - This yields \(n \geq 19,999\). However, to satisfy a strict inequality, \(n\) should be at least 20,000.

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding convergence tests and accurately interpreting error conditions in partial sums.
