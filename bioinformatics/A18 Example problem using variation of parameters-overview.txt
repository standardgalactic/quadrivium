The text describes a process for solving a system of differential equations using the method of variation of parameters, focusing on obtaining both complementary and particular solutions. Here's a summary:

1. **Introduction**: The goal is to solve a set of non-homogeneous linear differential equations using variation of parameters. This involves finding both complementary (homogeneous) and particular solutions.

2. **Complementary Solution**:
   - Begin with the homogeneous version of the equation by setting \( f(t) = 0 \).
   - Use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to find the complementary solution.
   - Construct the matrix \( A - \lambda I \), where \( A \) is a square matrix and \( \lambda \) represents eigenvalues.
   - Calculate the determinant of this matrix, set it to zero, and solve for eigenvalues (\( \lambda_1 = -2 \) and \( \lambda_2 = -5 \)).
   - Find eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues, resulting in constants \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \).
   - Construct the complementary solution using these values: \( x_c(t) = c_1 e^{-2t} + c_2 (1, -2)e^{-5t} \).

3. **Fundamental Matrix**:
   - From the complementary solutions, derive a fundamental matrix.
   - The fundamental matrix is composed of solutions to the homogeneous equation and can be expressed as:
     \[
     X(t) = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     e^{-2t} & e^{-5t} \\
     e^{-2t} & -2e^{-5t}
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

4. **Inverse of the Fundamental Matrix**:
   - Compute the inverse of the fundamental matrix to proceed with finding the particular solution.
   - The determinant of \( X(t) \) is used in calculating its inverse, resulting in an expression involving exponentials.

The text suggests stopping at this point to clean up and then proceed to find the particular solution using the inverse of the fundamental matrix.

The text describes a process of working with matrices and exponential functions, likely in the context of solving a system of differential equations using matrix methods. Here's a summarized breakdown:

1. **Matrix and Exponential Functions**: The discussion begins with expressions involving negative exponents of \( e \) (Euler's number). It simplifies these to obtain a scalar result, specifically \(-3\).

2. **Inverse Matrix Calculation**: This scalar is then used in the context of finding an inverse matrix, which results in terms like \( \frac{2}{3} e^{2t} \) and similar expressions.

3. **Multiplication with Function \( f(t) \)**: The inverse matrix is multiplied by a function \( f(t) = 3t e^{-t} \), resulting in a new 2x1 matrix after performing the multiplication.

4. **Integration**: The next step involves integrating the resultant 2x1 matrix. This requires applying integration techniques, including the product rule for integration.

5. **Product Rule Application**: Specifically, for an expression like \( 2t e^{2t} \), the product rule is used to find its integral:
   - Let \( u = 2t \) and \( v' = e^{2t} \).
   - Then \( u' = 2 \) and integrating \( v' \) gives \( v = \frac{1}{2} e^{2t} \).

6. **Integration Result**: The integration of \( 2t e^{2t} \) using the product rule results in:
   \[
   t e^{2t} - \frac{1}{2} e^{2t}
   \]

Overall, this text outlines a method for solving differential equations using matrix algebra and calculus techniques like integration by parts (product rule).

The text outlines a process for solving an integration problem involving matrices and functions. It begins with integrating expressions, particularly focusing on finding integrals like \( e^{2t} \) and \( e^t \), and adds constants such as "plus a third." The text then discusses constructing parts of a solution using the fundamental matrix method.

The next part involves integrating another 2x1 matrix, which includes steps that use the integration by parts technique (referred to as the "product tool"). Here, the integrand is split into \( u = t \) and \( dv = e^{5t} dt \), leading to solutions involving terms like \( \frac{1}{5} t e^{5t} - \frac{1}{25} e^{5t} \).

Finally, it mentions preparing for matrix multiplication between a 2x2 matrix and the resulting 2x1 matrix from integration. The text concludes by noting that completing this multiplication would be lengthy, suggesting stopping there to leave the computation as an exercise or further exploration. Overall, this is a detailed explanation of integrating functions within matrices in a step-by-step manner.

The text describes a process for finding a particular solution to a system of differential equations. It involves using the fundamental matrix, which represents the homogeneous complementary solutions of the system. To obtain the full answer, you multiply the inverse of this fundamental matrix by \( f(t) \), then integrate row by row to derive two rows of answers. This multiplication and integration process is straightforward and builds on obtaining the complementary set of solutions initially.

The text outlines a process for solving a system of differential equations using the method of variation of parameters, specifically focusing on obtaining both complementary and particular solutions.

1. **Initial Setup**: The problem involves a non-homogeneous square matrix \( A \), vector \( x \), and column vector \( f(t) \). The goal is to find the general solution, which includes both a complementary (homogeneous) solution and a particular solution.

2. **Complementary Solution**:
   - Set \( f(t) = 0 \) to convert the problem into a homogeneous one.
   - Use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to solve for the complementary solution.
   - Formulate matrix \( A - \lambda I \) and find its determinant, setting it to zero to find eigenvalues (\(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\)).
   - Calculate corresponding eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
   - Eigenvalues found are \(\lambda_1 = -2\) and \(\lambda_2 = -5\).
   - For each eigenvalue, solve the system \( (A - \lambda_i I)k_i = 0 \) to find eigenvectors (\( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \)).

4. **Complementary Solution Expression**:
   - Combine the results into a complementary solution: 
     \[
     x_c(t) = c_1 k_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} + c_2 k_2 e^{\lambda_2 t}
     \]
   - Specifically, \( x_c(t) = c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{-2t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} e^{-5t} \).

5. **Fundamental Matrix**:
   - Construct the fundamental matrix \( X(t) \) using the solutions found: 
     \[
     X(t) = \begin{bmatrix} e^{-2t} & e^{-5t} \\ e^{-2t} & -2e^{-5t} \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The fundamental matrix is used to find the particular solution.

6. **Particular Solution**:
   - To find the particular solution, compute the inverse of the fundamental matrix \( X(t) \).
   - Use the formula for the inverse involving the determinant and adjugate matrix.
   - The text indicates calculating the determinant as \( e^{-7t}(-2 + 1) = -e^{-7t} \).

The process is paused here, with plans to continue by finding the particular solution using the inverse of the fundamental matrix.

1. **Inverse Matrix Calculation**: The author starts by simplifying expressions involving exponentials to determine that the inverse of a fundamental matrix is proportional to \( e^{-7t} \). This results in the inverse being expressed as a 2x2 matrix with elements involving exponential terms.

2. **Matrix Multiplication**: The next step involves multiplying this inverse matrix by a function \( f(t) = [3t, e^{-t}]^T \), leading to a new 2x1 matrix after performing element-wise multiplication and addition.

3. **Integration**: After obtaining the resulting 2x1 matrix, the author integrates each component with respect to time \( t \). This requires using integration techniques such as the product rule for one of the terms.

4. **Product Rule Application**: Specifically, for a term like \( 2t e^{2t} \), the product rule is applied, resulting in an integral that simplifies to \( t e^{2t} - \frac{1}{2} e^{2t} + C \).
