In this section we're going to talk now about radioactivity.
And let's first start on this side.
When these radioactive substances
were first identified, now a radioactive substance means that that
nucleus is unstable, and it is in some
form going to break down, which is called a decay of a radioactive
substance. So this was put in some
of the substance inside this shielding, and what we
have is this magnetic field going into
the board there, and the photographic plate on the right, and then
we saw these three light zones
as something hit the photographic plate there.
And it was noted that there was no
deflection of one of these, and these were then called rays.
What came off of,
before it was known what it was, what came off
of the radioactive substance
was called rays.
And one didn't deflect at all, which meant
it had to be electrically neutral.
And if we think about force
being the cross product of
velocity
and cross product
of the magnetic fields, the velocity
in that direction, the magnetic field
in that direction, certainly
for positive particles that would be
in the upward, force would be
in the upward direction, and then for negatively
charged particles downward.
So they called this
alpha rays, and
these ones, defecting more,
that was the beta rays, and those that weren't
was called gamma rays.
First the letters
in the alphabet, alpha, beta, gamma.
And it was noted that alpha rays
was stopped by
about 0.01 millimeters
of lead.
It would stop an alpha ray.
And if you put lead here
of 0.1 millimeter, you would also
lose the beta rays, but these gamma rays
require 10 centimeters of lead
about, this is rough,
10 centimeters of lead
to stop a gamma ray.
And now
with that in mind
we come to radioactivity.
And what that brought about
was the fact that there is a new
law, a new conservation law.
There is the
law of
mass energy conservation,
we know that. There's the law of
conservation of linear momentum,
law of conservation of angular momentum,
of electric charge, and now
we're going to add a new one
of the nucleon number.
The nucleon number
does also needs to be conserved
during the radioactive decay
of an
atomic nucleus.
And we'll look at that in this section.
The first ray we're going to talk about
is the alpha ray.
If a radioactive nucleus undergoes
a change so that an alpha ray
escapes, we call that alpha decay
and through experiment
we now know that an alpha particle
is actually the nucleus
of a helium atom.
So, strictly speaking,
that should be 2 plus.
The two electrons are not there.
Strictly speaking,
it doesn't make much difference
in the kind of problems that we are going to do.
When a radioactive atom undergoes
alpha decay,
transmutation occurs.
Transmutation occurs.
What does transmutation mean?
It changes...
One element changes into another element.
And here we have some alchemy.
Whereas the old philosophers
tried to change one substance into gold.
That would be transmutation
through chemical processes.
We know that that's impossible
because chemical processes
only involve the electrons,
not the nucleus.
So, we have transmutation.
What we talk about is this process.
We tend to have a parent atom
with an atomic number,
an atomic mass number,
so number of protons,
number of protons plus neutrons.
That is going to now give you
this helium...
this helium...
nucleus.
In other words,
my atomic number is going to decrease by 2,
and my atomic mass number is going to decrease by 4,
inasmuch as I have 4 and 2 there.
Now, for instance,
if we look at uranium 238,
that's 92.
That is going to give us...
That is going to give us thorium.
And the thorium has an atomic number of 90.
I'm extracting 4 there.
That's 234.
So that's an isotope of thorium.
I'm going to have this 4,2 helium.
And remember that it's going to have 2 extra electrons
that does not have those electrons.
You can see it in that way for the moment.
What we're also now going to get is energy release.
I did not have to put in energy on this side.
So don't make that mistake.
There's no plus binding energy here.
We're going to release energy on this side.
We're going to release energy on this side.
This is an unstable...
This is an unstable nucleus.
We know that the binding energy per nucleon here
is rather high.
So this is stable.
So there's a stable thing coming out of this unstable nucleus.
Stable nucleus out of an unstable nucleus.
And that energy is going to go into different things.
That energy is going to go into kinetic energy for these two.
And there's also going to be a small amount of...
In this of a bit of gamma rays as well.
But the majority of the energy is going to go into these two.
And because there's conservation of linear momentum,
we have got to have that the momentum initially is going to equal the momentum,
the final momentum.
Initially no momentum.
And these velocities are non-relativistic.
So we're going to have mvp equals mv we need to use.
And we can set up a second equation looking at the kinetic energy.
Because this energy will be converted as a set to kinetic energy of these two.
Whereby the kinetic energy is going to equal half mv squared.
And we've got two equations.
We've got mass.
We've got v or v squared.
And we can solve, basically solve for...
Obviously the more massive one will have less velocity.
And the lighter one will have a larger velocity.
It does not go 50-50.
We have to do those equations certainly to do it.
So if I just use a quick example.
I'm going to show you 238 uranium.
It's about 238.0508 units.
And uranium 238 sorry.
Tholium 234 is 234.0436 units.
And then this helium.
Helium 24 obviously equals 4.0026 units.
Now if I write it like this.
If I write it like this.
We need to be concerned about the fact that this is just a nucleus.
Without electrons.
And these units actually include electrons.
Because I am summing these two.
I'm summing those two.
So no matter where the electrons are.
That doesn't really matter.
I'm just summing these two.
And then I subtract this from this side.
Which leaves me the energy.
And this energy in this example.
If we multiply by 93, 1.5 mega electron volt per unit.
Is 4.3, 4.3 mega electron volt energy that comes off.
Which will then be put into kinetic energy.
And a small amount of gamma ray specifically for this example.
Now let's consider the more exciting beta decay.
It was found through experiment that beta decay.
A beta particle was the electron.
And before we look at all of this.
I almost want to hide the two things I want to show you.
That it says beta negative decay.
Because you get three kinds of beta decay.
So let's just discuss beta negative decay.
Now look how we write an electron.
Not like we did before.
The electricity just for the mind is there to indicate it has a charge of negative one.
We're writing the atomic number as negative one.
And that indicates to us there's one proton missing.
So the charge is negative one.
So the charge is in there.
And certainly it's not the nucleon.
So it's atomic mass number zero.
And before you look at this.
You might think well the electron comes off.
What is transmutation doing there?
But of course there's transmutation.
Because this is what happens with beta negative decay.
You get a neutron.
That gets converted into a proton and an electron.
So one of the neutrons.
It's not one of the orbital electrons we're talking about here that comes off.
It is a neutron inside of the nucleus that decays.
That undergoes beta negative decay.
And that's going to give me a proton.
Which has an atomic number one.
Atomic mass number of one.
Plus then this electron which we've seen how to write.
So of course we get to have transmutation.
But unlike alpha decay where I took away two protons.
I'm actually adding a proton.
So again from parent to daughter.
I've got to add to my atomic number a one.
The neutron changes into a proton.
So I lose one neutron.
Add one proton.
So my atomic mass number is not going to change.
And that is reflected in the conservation of nucleons.
Because A equals A plus zero.
Nothing has changed.
Z on this side.
Here I have Z minus.
Z plus one.
Minus one.
So I have Z.
Also Z.
So I have complete conservation of nucleon number.
My new conservation law.
So you can see we're going to have a new daughter element.
And it's going to have one more proton.
So when you look at this.
We have thorium 234.
That is going to beta negative decay into protactinium.
Have you ever heard of protactinium?
Now you have.
So that will be a 91.
That will remain 234.
And we'll have one electron.
Now that electron obviously.
If we write this.
We've got to say plus energy.
Again on this side.
Again we're not adding the energy.
Therefore binding.
Plus energy.
And that energy is also shared.
Obviously the mass of this versus the mass of that.
There's a massive ratio difference there.
So almost all of this energy is going to go into that electron.
That electron actually escapes.
Leaving protactinium.
Protactinium 234 has been charged.
Positive one.
Once again I'm adding these two.
So if I use units.
I can just use the units.
234.04330.
If we use.
If we use.
If we use.
If we use.
If we use.
Thorium.
234.
As being.
234 point.
Where did we have that before.
O459.
O459.
O459 units.
Even.
Even.
Even.
Even.
More.
I just say.
That is going to give us some energy.
or even more digits there.
That is going to give us energy for this beta negative decay.
Remember, my energy is there, so I'm subtracting this from that.
And I get 0.27 mega electron volt, or 270 kilo electron
kilo electron volts.
0.27 mega electron volts.
OK, now next we're going to look at two other kinds of beta decay.
Now for the other two types of beta decay,
first I'll just quickly mention this,
because we won't spend much time on it.
It's called electron capture, or k capture.
And that is where the nucleus actually captures one
of the orbiting electrons.
So instead of beta negative decay,
when we had one of the electrons escape from a neutron,
but it doesn't really do that.
It didn't exist in the neutron to start off with.
Anyway, we're going to capture and it's also called k capture,
because it's usually out of the k shell, the closest shell,
or the lowest energy shell that the electron is then captured.
More importantly, we want to discuss beta positive decay.
And what comes off now is a positron.
Note that it will have a positive one electric charge there.
Still, it's not a nuclear.
So again, transmutation is going to occur.
Why?
Because this time it's a proton that decays into a neutron plus a positron.
So proton 1, 1, I have conservation of atomic mass numbers,
conservation of atomic numbers.
So my nucleon count does not change conservation of nucleon number
for my conservation law.
So if I have a parent element there, and now I have a daughter element,
and I'm losing one proton.
I'm losing one proton.
So that becomes the z minus 1, and that gives me this electron.
And we have a equals a, and z equals negative 1 positive 1 cancel z.
And so a proton decays into a neutron plus a positron.
