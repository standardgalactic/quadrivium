This tutorial explains how to calculate and interpret standard deviation using spreadsheet software. It guides users through creating data columns, computing the mean with the `=AVERAGE` formula, and selecting columns via shortcuts (F2 on Windows or Ctrl-U on Mac). The text describes calculating standard deviation for population (`=STDEV.P`) and sample (`=STDEV.S`) data.

It illustrates how to visualize data points as blue diamonds and the mean as a red square on a chart. A given standard deviation of 14.8 shows data spread around the mean, with deviations in both directions considered. To find values one standard deviation from the mean, it suggests using mean Â± standard deviation calculations, resulting in boundaries of 12.3 and 41.9.

The initial sections offer clear instructions on calculating and interpreting standard deviations, while later parts may have transcription errors or typos.
