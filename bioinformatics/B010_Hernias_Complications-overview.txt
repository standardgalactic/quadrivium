The text provides an overview of complications associated with hernias and their surgical repairs. Here's a summary:

### Complications of Hernias:
1. **Discomfort and Pain**: Can significantly impact quality of life, often leading to requests for surgical repair.
2. **Cosmetic Issues**: Unattractive bulges may cause dissatisfaction, particularly in social or sporting contexts.
3. **Loss of Movement**: Physical activities might be hindered by the need to contain a hernia with supports like corsets.
4. **Incarceration**: Occurs when hernia contents cannot be manually reduced due to adhesions or engorgement, potentially leading to obstruction.
5. **Strangulation**: Involves compromised blood supply causing ischemia and necrosis; can affect hollow viscera or other tissues like exoperitoneal fat, posing serious risks.

### Complications of Hernia Surgery:
1. **Recurrence**: Can occur immediately post-surgery or later due to various factors.
2. **Wound Sepsis**: Early infections are possible, especially in emergency surgeries involving bowel resection; can lead to necrotizing fasciitis.
3. **Graft Sepsis**: Infections around prosthetic mesh (graft) used in repairs; may be treated with antibiotics or require graft removal if persistent.
4. **Injury to Surrounding Structures**: Can include damage to hollow viscera, solid organs, nerves, and blood vessels during surgery.
5. **Seromas and Hematomas**: Result from dead spaces created when tissue planes are lifted; may necessitate the use of closed system suction drains, particularly with foreign materials like mesh.

The text emphasizes that while these complications can be serious, many can be managed or mitigated through careful surgical planning and post-operative care.
