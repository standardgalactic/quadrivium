The text outlines methods for rounding numbers and finding common divisors and multiples:

1. **Rounding Numbers**:
   - The `round` function rounds to the nearest integer (e.g., 3.4 becomes 3, 3.5 becomes 4).
   - The `ceiling` function always rounds up towards positive infinity (e.g., ceiling(3.001) = 4; ceiling(-3.999) = -3).
   - The `floor` function rounds down towards negative infinity (e.g., floor(3.999) = 3; floor(-3.001) = -4).
   - The `trunc` or `truncate` function rounds towards zero, removing the fractional part (e.g., trunc(3.999) = 3; trunc(-3.999) = -3).

2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:
   - GCD finds the largest number that divides a set of numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, for 4, 8, and 20, the GCD is 4.

3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - LCM determines the smallest common multiple shared by a set of numbers. For instance, among 2, 3, 5, and 10, the LCM is 30.

These methods are essential for various mathematical computations.
