The lecture focuses on performing symbolic differentiation using SymPy in Python within a notebook environment. Here are the key steps:

1. **Symbol Initialization**: Variables \( A \), \( B \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) are defined as symbols with `sym.Symbol`.

2. **Defining Expressions**: An expression \( f = \sin(XZ) + \cos(XY) \) is set up for derivative calculations.

3. **Derivatives**:
   - **First Derivative**: The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( X \) is computed using `SYM.D(f, X)`.
   - **Second Derivative**: Obtained by either chaining differentiation or specifying syntax like `X, 2`.

4. **Higher-Order Partial Derivatives**: For an expression \( F = \sin(XY) + \cos(XZ) \), higher-order partial derivatives are calculated by indicating the order for each variable.

5. **Using `diff` Function**: The `diff` function is recommended for computing derivatives, allowing direct specification of variables and their orders (e.g., `f.diff(X)`).

The session provides a foundational understanding of symbolic differentiation with SymPy, covering both basic and complex derivative computations.
