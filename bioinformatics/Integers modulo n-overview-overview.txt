The discussion revolves around modular arithmetic and its application in forming equivalence classes, particularly using integers modulo 4 (\(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\)). Let's break down these concepts:

### Equivalence Classes

1. **Definition**: An equivalence class groups elements that are equivalent under a specific relation. In this context, the relation is congruence modulo 4.

2. **Construction**:
   - We consider integers and classify them based on their remainders when divided by 4.
   - The possible remainders (equivalence classes) are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   - For example, the class [0] includes numbers like ..., -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, ...

### Set \( S \)

- **Elements**: The set \( S = \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \) represents these equivalence classes.
- **Purpose**: This set is used to perform operations like addition within the constraints of modular arithmetic.

### Addition in Modular Arithmetic

1. **Definition**:
   - Addition is defined by selecting representatives from each class and adding them using regular integer addition.
   - The result is then reduced modulo 4 to ensure it remains within the set \( S \).

2. **Examples**:
   - \( 1 + 3 = 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \)
   - \( 2 + 2 = 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \)

### Group Properties

The text explores whether the set \( S \) with addition forms a group. A mathematical group must satisfy four properties:

1. **Closure**: The sum of any two elements in \( S \) is also an element of \( S \).
   - For example, adding 2 and 3 gives 5, which is equivalent to 1 modulo 4.

2. **Associativity**: Addition is associative; for all \( a, b, c \in S \), \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\).

3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element in \( S \) that acts as an identity under addition.
   - Zero serves this role: \( 0 + a = a + 0 = a \) for any \( a \in S \).

4. **Inverses**: Every element has an inverse such that their sum is the identity element.
   - For example, the inverse of 1 is 3 because \( 1 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \).

### Conclusion

The set \( S = \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \) with addition modulo 4 indeed forms a group. This group is often denoted as \(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\), illustrating the concept of integers under addition where results are taken modulo 4. This structure is fundamental in number theory and abstract algebra, providing insights into cyclic groups and modular systems.

The text explores addition within equivalence classes, illustrating how numbers consistently fall into specific classes when added together. It uses examples such as adding one repeatedly through various classes or combining different numbers like 1+2 and 3+2, showing predictable outcomes based on their equivalence class structure.

Further, the text examines a set of integers: \(-2\), \(1\), \(3\), and \(7\), checking if it forms a group under addition. It confirms this by verifying properties such as closure (all sums remain in the set), associativity (suggesting testing with specific elements), identity (0 acts as the identity element), and inverses (each element has an inverse within the set).

The discussion extends to integers modulo \(n\) (\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)), where it forms a group under addition due to satisfying closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. However, when considering multiplication as the operation, \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) does not form a group because not all elements have multiplicative inversesâ€”typically only 1 and -1 or their equivalents do.

The text encourages further exploration of these properties to understand the distinctions between additive and multiplicative structures in modular arithmetic.
