The text provides an intuitive explanation of multivariable calculus by comparing it to single-variable calculus and using geometrical visualizations. It begins with the concept of a function \( f(x) \), which is understood as a curve in two-dimensional space. When extended to two variables, \( f(x, y) \), this becomes a surface in three-dimensional space.

To visualize this surface, imagine it as a blanket or dome suspended in 3D space, with axes x, y, and z, where each (x, y) pair maps to a height (z-value). Cross-sections of the surface are explored by intersecting it with planes parallel to either the x-z or y-z axes. These intersections form curves called "profiles," such as the "y-z profile" at \( x = a \) and the "x-z profile" at \( y = b \).

Partial derivatives play a key role in understanding these profiles:
- The first partial derivative, \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \), indicates how z changes with x when y is held constant.
- The first partial derivative, \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \), shows how z changes with y when x is held constant.

The second partial derivatives describe the curvature of these profiles. Overall, understanding multivariable functions involves visualizing their 3D representations and analyzing cross-sections to understand their behavior.

Additionally, points in space are represented as vectors, and the text explains how a point \((a, b)\) in the domain leads to \( f(a, b) = c \). Partial derivatives at this point describe rates of change: the first with respect to x or y, and the second concerning the rate of change of z with respect to another variable.
