The text describes solving a differential equation involving both transient and steady-state components in an initial value problem with a periodic forcing function \( f(t) \). Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Transient Solution**: 
   - The differential equation is converted to its auxiliary form.
   - Solving for complex roots suggests oscillatory behavior.
   - The solution involves exponential decay \( e^{-t} \) combined with sinusoidal functions (cosine and sine), which diminish as time progresses.

2. **Steady-State Solution**:
   - Assumed to be a combination of cosine and sine terms.
   - By substituting into the differential equation, coefficients are determined to satisfy the periodic input.
   - The steady-state solution is found to be \( 2\sin(t) \).

3. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Given initial conditions: \( x(0) = 0 \) and \( x'(0) = x_1 \).
   - These are used to solve for constants in the transient solution.
   - The constant \( c_1 \) is zero due to initial conditions, while \( c_2 \) is calculated as \( x_1 - 2 \).

4. **Complete Solution**:
   - Combines both the transient and steady-state solutions.
   - Transient part: \( e^{-t}(x_1 - 2)\sin(t) \), which fades over time.
   - Steady-state part: \( 2\sin(t) \).
   - The overall solution is:
     \[
     x(t) = e^{-t}(x_1 - 2)\sin(t) + 2\sin(t)
     \]
   This captures both the initial transient behavior and the long-term periodic response.
