The text explores advanced mathematical concepts, particularly as they apply to life sciences and other domains. It discusses understanding what happens as time approaches infinity, which is crucial for modeling processes like epidemics that last months or years. While "infinity" here doesn't mean an infinite amount of time, the concept helps in predicting long-term outcomes.

Continuity of functions is another key topic addressed. A function's continuity determines if its first derivative (rate of change) can be calculated over a specific domain, as derivatives require continuous functions to avoid errors. Limits are vital for determining continuity; they help identify points where functions may have discontinuities or gaps in the graph.

Examples of discontinuities include undefined functions at certain points (e.g., \(\ln(t)\) is not defined for \(t \leq 0\)), and cases where limits do not exist due to differing left-hand and right-hand limits. Vertical asymptotes, such as those found in the tangent function, represent non-removable discontinuities since limits tend toward infinity.

Removable discontinuities are also discussed, exemplified by a rational function with a hole that can be "fixed" algebraically (e.g., factoring to cancel terms). However, simplifying functions doesn't change their original properties; hence careful modeling is required using piecewise definitions to accurately represent the function at points of discontinuity.

Non-removable discontinuities are highlighted through examples like \(f(t) = \frac{1}{t^2}\), where limits do not exist as they approach infinity, and generalizations for functions in the form \(\frac{a}{(t-b)^n}\), which exhibit vertical asymptotes at \(b\). These concepts underscore the importance of understanding function behavior at specific points to ensure accurate mathematical modeling.

The text discusses mathematical concepts related to limits, focusing on specific cases of functions as variables approach certain values. It highlights:

1. **Non-removable Discontinuity**: The cosine of \( \frac{1}{t} \) as \( t \) approaches 0 is a non-removable discontinuity because it oscillates infinitely without settling at any value.

2. **Limits at Infinity**:
   - For functions like \( \frac{a}{t^k} \), where \( a \) is a constant and \( k > 0 \), the limit as \( t \) approaches positive or negative infinity is 0.
   - This principle applies to various examples, such as \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{3,000,000}{t^6} = 0 \).

3. **Indeterminate Forms**: The text mentions indeterminate forms like \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \), which require specific techniques to resolve.

4. **Limit Laws and Simplification**:
   - By dividing terms by the highest power in the denominator, complex limits can be simplified.
   - For example, \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{t^2 + 2}{t^3 + 2t^2 + t - 2} \) simplifies to 0 after dividing by \( t^3 \).

5. **Trigonometric Limits**:
   - The limits of \( \frac{\sin t}{t} \) and \( \frac{t}{\sin t} \) as \( t \) approaches 0 are both 1.
   - However, the limits of \( \cos(\frac{1}{t}) \) and \( \sin(\frac{1}{t}) \) as \( t \) approaches 0 do not exist due to infinite oscillation.

These concepts are essential for understanding behavior in calculus, particularly when dealing with discontinuities and evaluating complex limits.

The text consists of two repeated words: "Excellent." This suggests a positive or approving sentiment but provides no additional information or context.

The text delves into advanced mathematical concepts related to limits and continuity, particularly in their applications to life sciences and modeling scenarios like epidemics. Key points include:

1. **Concept of Infinity**: The idea of infinity is explored not as an infinite number but rather as a long time span, such as several years, relevant for understanding phenomena like disease spread.

2. **Continuity and Limits**: The text discusses the importance of continuity in functions and how limits help determine if a function is continuous at certain points. Continuity is crucial when calculating derivatives, which represent rates of change over time.

3. **Types of Discontinuities**:
   - **Undefined Points**: A function may be undefined at specific points (e.g., natural log of t for t ≤ 0), leading to discontinuities.
   - **Non-Existence of Limits**: If limits do not exist due to piecewise definitions or unequal left and right-hand limits, discontinuities arise.
   - **Vertical Asymptotes**: Functions with vertical asymptotes (e.g., tangent function) are inherently discontinuous at those points.

4. **Removable Discontinuities**: These occur when a limit exists despite an apparent gap in the function (like 0/0). Algebraic manipulation can "remove" such discontinuities, transforming the function into one without gaps for practical modeling purposes. However, care must be taken to define functions piecewise where necessary.

5. **Non-Removable Discontinuities**: Some discontinuities cannot be removed, such as those involving vertical asymptotes (e.g., 1/t² at t = 0), where the function approaches infinity and no limit exists.

Overall, understanding these concepts is essential for accurately modeling real-world phenomena and interpreting mathematical functions in applied contexts.

The text discusses concepts related to limits in calculus, focusing on specific cases involving functions as they approach certain values. Here's a summary:

1. **Infinite Oscillation**: The cosine of \( \frac{1}{t} \) as \( t \) approaches 0 exhibits infinite oscillation and does not settle at any particular value. This behavior is characterized as a non-removable discontinuity, meaning the function doesn't have a limit or solution at that point.

2. **Limits Involving Powers of \( t \)**:
   - As \( t \) approaches infinity, for functions like \( \frac{a}{t^k} \) where \( a \) is any real number and \( k > 0 \), the limit equals 0.
   - This concept is illustrated with examples, such as \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{3,000,000}{t^6} = 0 \).

3. **Indeterminate Forms**: When evaluating limits that result in indeterminate forms like "infinity over infinity," simplifying the expression by dividing by the highest power of \( t \) in the denominator can help resolve these cases.

4. **Other Limit Examples**:
   - As \( t \to \infty \), functions with a constant numerator and increasing powers of \( t \) in the denominator approach 0.
   - Limits like \( \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{a}{t^k} \) for \( k > 0 \) tend to infinity, indicating that such limits do not exist (denoted by the empty set).

5. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - The limit of \( \sin(t)/t \) and \( t/\sin(t) \) as \( t \to 0 \) is 1.
   - However, the limits of \( \cos(1/t) \) or \( \sin(1/t) \) as \( t \to 0 \) do not exist due to their oscillatory nature.

These concepts are important for understanding how functions behave under various conditions and are useful in many mathematical applications.
