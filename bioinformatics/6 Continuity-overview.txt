The text explores advanced mathematical concepts, particularly as they apply to life sciences and other domains. It discusses understanding what happens as time approaches infinity, which is crucial for modeling processes like epidemics that last months or years. While "infinity" here doesn't mean an infinite amount of time, the concept helps in predicting long-term outcomes.

Continuity of functions is another key topic addressed. A function's continuity determines if its first derivative (rate of change) can be calculated over a specific domain, as derivatives require continuous functions to avoid errors. Limits are vital for determining continuity; they help identify points where functions may have discontinuities or gaps in the graph.

Examples of discontinuities include undefined functions at certain points (e.g., \(\ln(t)\) is not defined for \(t \leq 0\)), and cases where limits do not exist due to differing left-hand and right-hand limits. Vertical asymptotes, such as those found in the tangent function, represent non-removable discontinuities since limits tend toward infinity.

Removable discontinuities are also discussed, exemplified by a rational function with a hole that can be "fixed" algebraically (e.g., factoring to cancel terms). However, simplifying functions doesn't change their original properties; hence careful modeling is required using piecewise definitions to accurately represent the function at points of discontinuity.

Non-removable discontinuities are highlighted through examples like \(f(t) = \frac{1}{t^2}\), where limits do not exist as they approach infinity, and generalizations for functions in the form \(\frac{a}{(t-b)^n}\), which exhibit vertical asymptotes at \(b\). These concepts underscore the importance of understanding function behavior at specific points to ensure accurate mathematical modeling.

The text discusses mathematical concepts related to limits, focusing on specific cases of functions as variables approach certain values. It highlights:

1. **Non-removable Discontinuity**: The cosine of \( \frac{1}{t} \) as \( t \) approaches 0 is a non-removable discontinuity because it oscillates infinitely without settling at any value.

2. **Limits at Infinity**:
   - For functions like \( \frac{a}{t^k} \), where \( a \) is a constant and \( k > 0 \), the limit as \( t \) approaches positive or negative infinity is 0.
   - This principle applies to various examples, such as \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{3,000,000}{t^6} = 0 \).

3. **Indeterminate Forms**: The text mentions indeterminate forms like \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \), which require specific techniques to resolve.

4. **Limit Laws and Simplification**:
   - By dividing terms by the highest power in the denominator, complex limits can be simplified.
   - For example, \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{t^2 + 2}{t^3 + 2t^2 + t - 2} \) simplifies to 0 after dividing by \( t^3 \).

5. **Trigonometric Limits**:
   - The limits of \( \frac{\sin t}{t} \) and \( \frac{t}{\sin t} \) as \( t \) approaches 0 are both 1.
   - However, the limits of \( \cos(\frac{1}{t}) \) and \( \sin(\frac{1}{t}) \) as \( t \) approaches 0 do not exist due to infinite oscillation.

These concepts are essential for understanding behavior in calculus, particularly when dealing with discontinuities and evaluating complex limits.
