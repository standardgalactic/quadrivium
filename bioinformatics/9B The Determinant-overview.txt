This lecture on linear algebra focuses on calculating the determinant of matrices and its applications. Here's a summary:

1. **Determinant Importance**: The determinant is crucial because the inverse of a matrix \( A \) can be found using the formula:
   \[
   A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \times \text{adj}(A)
   \]
   If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular and has no inverse.

2. **Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix**: The process involves selecting rows or columns with zeros for simplicity. For example, given:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   The determinant is calculated by expanding along the first column and using cofactor expansion, resulting in a determinant of 6.

3. **Scalar Multiplication**: If a matrix \( A \) is multiplied by a scalar \( k \), the determinant scales as:
   \[
   \text{det}(kA) = k^n \times \text{det}(A)
   \]
   where \( n \) is the size of the square matrix. For example, multiplying a 3x3 matrix by 3 results in the determinant being multiplied by \( 27 \).

4. **Matrix Addition**: There isn't a straightforward formula for the determinant of the sum of two matrices (\( A + B \)). The determinant must be calculated after performing the matrix addition.

5. **Product of Matrices**: For square matrices \( C \) and \( D \), the determinant of their product equals the product of their determinants:
   \[
   \text{det}(CD) = \text{det}(C) \times \text{det}(D)
   \]
   This is illustrated with 2x2 matrices, confirming that the determinant of the product matches the expected result.

Overall, the lecture highlights key properties and methods for calculating determinants in different scenarios.

The text discusses how to find the determinant of an inverse matrix. It states that for an invertible matrix \( A \), the determinant of its inverse is equal to \( \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \). This requires \( A \) to be invertible, which means its determinant cannot be zero (since division by zero is undefined). Thus, if you have a matrix that is invertible, calculating the determinant of its inverse involves taking the reciprocal of the original matrix's determinant.

The lecture series on linear algebra continues with a focus on the determinant of matrices. The importance of determinants is highlighted, particularly their role in finding the inverse of a matrix using the formula involving the adjoint and the determinant.

### Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix
- A 3x3 matrix example is provided: 
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 3 & 2 \\
  0 & 1 & 2 \\
  1 & 1 & 4 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The determinant calculation involves selecting a row or column with the most zeros. Here, column 1 is chosen due to its zero.
- Using cofactor expansion along column 1, the determinant is calculated as:
  - \( A_{11}C_{11} + A_{31}C_{31} = 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 4 = 6 \).

### Scalar Multiplication and Determinant
- When a matrix is multiplied by a scalar \( K \), the determinant of the resulting matrix is \( K^n \) times the original determinant, where \( n \) is the size of the matrix.
- Example: Multiplying the given matrix by 3 results in:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  3 & 9 & 6 \\
  0 & 3 & 6 \\
  3 & 3 & 12 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The determinant of this new matrix is calculated as \( 162 \), which matches the formula \( 3^3 \times 6 = 162 \).

### Determinant Properties
- **Addition**: There is no simple rule for the determinant of a sum of matrices (\( A + B \)). It requires computing the determinant of the resulting matrix.
- **Multiplication**: The determinant of the product of two matrices equals the product of their determinants: \( \det(AB) = \det(A) \times \det(B) \).
  - Example with 2x2 matrices:
    - Matrix \( A \): 
      \[
      \begin{bmatrix}
      3 & 1 \\
      -2 & 6 \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      \]
    - Matrix \( B \):
      \[
      \begin{bmatrix}
      -1 & 3 \\
      5 & 8 \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      \]
    - Determinant of \( A \) is \( 1 \).
    - Determinant of \( B \) is \( -23 \).
    - Matrix \( AB \):
      \[
      \begin{bmatrix}
      -1 & 17 \\
      3 & 14 \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      \]
    - Determinant of \( AB \) is \( -23 \), confirming the property.

This lecture emphasizes understanding determinant properties and their implications in matrix operations.

The text discusses the relationship between a matrix and its inverse, specifically focusing on their determinants. If matrix \( A \) is invertible (meaning it has an inverse), then the determinant of the inverse of matrix \( A \) is equal to \( 1 \) divided by the determinant of \( A \). This implies that for a matrix to be invertible, its determinant must not be zero, as division by zero is undefined. Therefore, ensuring the determinant is non-zero confirms the matrix's invertibility and allows the calculation of the inverse's determinant as described.
