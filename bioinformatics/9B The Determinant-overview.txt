This lecture on linear algebra focuses on calculating the determinant of matrices and its applications. Here's a summary:

1. **Determinant Importance**: The determinant is crucial because the inverse of a matrix \( A \) can be found using the formula:
   \[
   A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \times \text{adj}(A)
   \]
   If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular and has no inverse.

2. **Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix**: The process involves selecting rows or columns with zeros for simplicity. For example, given:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   The determinant is calculated by expanding along the first column and using cofactor expansion, resulting in a determinant of 6.

3. **Scalar Multiplication**: If a matrix \( A \) is multiplied by a scalar \( k \), the determinant scales as:
   \[
   \text{det}(kA) = k^n \times \text{det}(A)
   \]
   where \( n \) is the size of the square matrix. For example, multiplying a 3x3 matrix by 3 results in the determinant being multiplied by \( 27 \).

4. **Matrix Addition**: There isn't a straightforward formula for the determinant of the sum of two matrices (\( A + B \)). The determinant must be calculated after performing the matrix addition.

5. **Product of Matrices**: For square matrices \( C \) and \( D \), the determinant of their product equals the product of their determinants:
   \[
   \text{det}(CD) = \text{det}(C) \times \text{det}(D)
   \]
   This is illustrated with 2x2 matrices, confirming that the determinant of the product matches the expected result.

Overall, the lecture highlights key properties and methods for calculating determinants in different scenarios.

The text discusses how to find the determinant of an inverse matrix. It states that for an invertible matrix \( A \), the determinant of its inverse is equal to \( \frac{1}{\text{det}(A)} \). This requires \( A \) to be invertible, which means its determinant cannot be zero (since division by zero is undefined). Thus, if you have a matrix that is invertible, calculating the determinant of its inverse involves taking the reciprocal of the original matrix's determinant.
