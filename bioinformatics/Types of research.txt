When you embark upon research, it's important to understand what types of studies you can do.
Now, there are many classification systems, and in this lecture I provide you with one such system.
We see that we can do research by form of case study, case control series, cross-sectional series, cohort series,
and then clinical trials where we're actually going to do some intervention.
Those would be trials with independent concurrent controls, trials with self-controls, trials with external controls, and even uncontrolled trials.
And then, very importantly, there are the meta-analyses and reviews.
Now, many of these can be mixed and matched in your research.
Please have a read through this text and become familiar with the types of research that is out there.
