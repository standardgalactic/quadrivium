The text discusses strategies for conducting research in environments with limited resources, highlighting the importance of maintaining anonymity and security when collecting data online. Key points include:

1. **Resource Constraints**: Due to a lack of funding in many regions, researchers must use simple, cost-effective methods like internet-based tools (e.g., Google Forms) for data collection.

2. **Data Anonymization**: Protecting patient identities is essential. Data should be anonymized by avoiding direct identifiers such as names or IDs and using numerical codes instead. Corresponding details should be stored separately.

3. **Categorization & Coding**: Implement non-descriptive coding systems (e.g., "Cat 1" for severity, "Var 1" for age) to prevent identification while maintaining clarity among team members.

4. **Age Anonymization Example**: In the project example, ages are anonymized by adding a constant number and adjusted during analysis using programming tools like Julia.

5. **Lab Values & Complexity**: While lab values aren't altered in this specific instance, complex projects should consider further anonymizing such data to protect sensitive information.

6. **Google Forms Setup**: The text briefly covers setting up Google Forms for data collection and transitioning to using Julia for data analysis, focusing on practical application rather than detailed coding instructions.
