The text explains refraction at a single spherical refracting surface, distinguishing it from lenses, and introduces an equation for image formation:

\[ \frac{N_1}{S_0} + \frac{N_2}{S_i} = \frac{N_2 - N_1}{R} \]

Key concepts include:

1. **Refracting Surface**: Focus is on a single spherical surface, not lenses.

2. **Mediums and Refractive Indices**:
   - \(N_1\): Index of the medium with the object.
   - \(N_2\): Index of the opposite side's medium.

3. **Curvature (R)**:
   - Negative for concave surfaces facing the object.
   - Positive for convex surfaces facing the object.

4. **Image Position (\(S_i\))**:
   - Positive if on the opposite side as the object (real image).
   - Negative if on the same side as the object (virtual image).

5. **Example Problem**:
   - Amber piece with \(N_1 = 1.6\) and a convex surface facing air (\(N_2 = 1.0\)).
   - Radius \(R\) is +3 mm, but effectively negative for an internal object.
   - Virtual image located 5 mm deep from outside (\(S_i = -5\) mm).

6. **Calculation**:
   - Using the equation: 
     \[ \frac{1.6}{S_0} + \frac{1.0}{-5} = \frac{1.0 - 1.6}{-3} \]
   - Solving for \( S_0 \) determines the object's actual depth inside the amber.

The text emphasizes understanding these conventions to determine image properties in optical setups involving spherical refracting surfaces. The calculation process involves solving an equation with given values, resulting in determining a specific distance related to the setup.
