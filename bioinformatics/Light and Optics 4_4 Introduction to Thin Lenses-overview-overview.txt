The text discusses the effects of different mediums on the properties of lenses, focusing on focal lengths and refractive indices:

1. **Bi-Convex Lens Problem:**
   - A bi-convex lens with radii of curvature 18 cm (R1) and 20 cm (R2) is examined.
   - The object distance is 24 cm, and the image distance is 32 cm, resulting in a focal length of 13.7 cm using the lens formula.
   - The refractive index \( N \) is calculated to be approximately 1.69 using the lens maker's formula.

2. **Lens in Water:**
   - A lens with a refractive index of 1.5, when placed in water (refractive index 1.33), experiences a change in focal length.
   - The new focal length is calculated to be approximately 39.1 cm using the modified formula for lenses in different mediums.

3. **Bi-Convex Lens in Different Mediums:**
   - A bi-convex lens with equal radii of curvature (20 cm) and a refractive index of 1.5 behaves differently depending on its medium.
   - In air, it acts as a converging lens.
   - When submerged in carbon disulfide (refractive index 1.56), it becomes a diverging lens due to the higher refractive index of the surrounding medium.

The main takeaway is that lenses can change their optical behavior when placed in mediums with different refractive indices, highlighting how environmental factors influence lens properties.
