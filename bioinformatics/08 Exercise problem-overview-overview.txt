The text outlines a proof for the associative property of set intersections, demonstrating that for any sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), the expressions \( (A \cap B) \cap C \) and \( A \cap (B \cap C) \) are equal. The proof involves two main steps:

1. **First Direction:** Start with an element \( X \) in \( (A \cap B) \cap C \). By definition, this means \( X \in A \), \( X \in B \), and \( X \in C \). Consequently, \( X \) is also in \( B \cap C \), leading to \( X \in A \cap (B \cap C) \). Thus, \( (A \cap B) \cap C \subseteq A \cap (B \cap C) \).

2. **Second Direction:** Begin with an element \( X \) in \( A \cap (B \cap C) \). This implies \( X \in A \) and \( X \in B \cap C \), meaning \( X \in B \) and \( X \in C \). Therefore, \( X \in A \cap B \), and since \( X \in C \), it follows that \( X \in (A \cap B) \cap C \). Thus, \( A \cap (B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cap C \).

Since both subset relations are established, the sets are equal: \( (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C) \). The proof relies on applying the definitions of set intersection and equality.

The text outlines a method to prove the associative property of set intersections, specifically that for any sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), the expressions \( (A \cap B) \cap C \) and \( A \cap (B \cap C) \) are equal. The proof is structured in two main parts:

1. **First Direction:** Assume an element \( X \) belongs to \( (A \cap B) \cap C \). By the definition of intersection, \( X \) must be in both \( A \cap B \) and \( C \), which implies that \( X \in A \), \( X \in B \), and \( X \in C \). From this, we conclude that \( X \in (B \cap C) \) and therefore \( X \in A \cap (B \cap C) \). Hence, \( (A \cap B) \cap C \subseteq A \cap (B \cap C) \).

2. **Second Direction:** Assume an element \( X \) belongs to \( A \cap (B \cap C) \). This means that \( X \in A \) and \( X \in B \cap C \), which implies \( X \in B \) and \( X \in C \). Consequently, \( X \in A \cap B \), and since \( X \in C \), it follows that \( X \in (A \cap B) \cap C \). Thus, \( A \cap (B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cap C \).

By demonstrating both subset relations, we conclude the sets are equal: \( (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C) \). The proof relies on the definitions of set intersection and set equality.
