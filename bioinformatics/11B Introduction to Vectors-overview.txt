### Concepts Summarized

1. **Vector Translation**: When translating a coordinate system by moving its origin from \((0, 0)\) in the old system to \((k, l)\), vectors themselves remain unchanged in magnitude and direction.

2. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - For any point \(P(x, y)\) in the old coordinate system, its new coordinates \(P'(x', y')\) after translation are given by:
     - \(x' = x - k\)
     - \(y' = y - l\)

3. **Reversing Transformation**:
   - To find original coordinates from translated ones:
     - \(x = x' + k\)
     - \(y = y' + l\)

4. **Vector Consistency**: The vector between two points remains consistent irrespective of the coordinate system's origin, provided the transformation is parallel.

### Example

- **Original Points**:
  - \(P(2, 0)\)
  - \(Q(3, 6)\)

- **Translation by \((k, l) = (4, 1)\)**:
  - New coordinates for \(P'\):
    - \(x' = 2 - 4 = -2\)
    - \(y' = 0 - 1 = -1\)
    - Thus, \(P'(-2, -1)\)

  - New coordinates for \(Q'\):
    - \(x' = 3 - 4 = -1\)
    - \(y' = 6 - 1 = 5\)
    - Thus, \(Q'(-1, 5)\)

- **Vector Consistency**:
  - Original vector \(\overrightarrow{PQ}\):
    - \(x\) component: \(3 - 2 = 1\)
    - \(y\) component: \(6 - 0 = 6\)
  
  - Translated vector \(\overrightarrow{P'Q'}\):
    - \(x'\) component: \(-1 - (-2) = 1\)
    - \(y'\) component: \(5 - (-1) = 6\)

- **Reversing Transformation**:
  - From \(P'(-2, -1)\) back to original coordinates:
    - \(x = -2 + 4 = 2\)
    - \(y = -1 + 1 = 0\)

  - From \(Q'(-1, 5)\) back to original coordinates:
    - \(x = -1 + 4 = 3\)
    - \(y = 5 + 1 = 6\)

These transformations and checks illustrate how vectors remain consistent across parallel translations of coordinate systems.
