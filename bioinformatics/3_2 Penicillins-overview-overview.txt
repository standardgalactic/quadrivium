Penicillins are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics characterized by a shared beta-lactam ring structure. They are divided into several generations:

1. **First-generation**: Includes Benzyl penicillin (Pen-G), which is injectable with a short half-life, primarily targeting Gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes but not effective against Penicillinase-producing Staphylococci or MRSA.

2. **Second-generation**: Contains Ampicillin and Amoxicillin, extending activity to certain Gram-negative bacteria.

3. **Anti-staphylococcal**: Includes Cloxacillin for penicillinase-producing Staphylococci but not against MRSA.

4. **Third-generation**: Like Ticacillin, targeting more severe infections.

5. **Fourth-generation**: Such as Piperacillin, with a broader spectrum including pseudomonal infections.

**Spectrum of Activity**: First-generation penicillins are limited to specific bacteria, while later generations cover a wider range, including certain Gram-negative and resistant strains.

**Resistance Mechanisms**: Bacterial resistance can occur through decreased penetration at the target site, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins, or inactivation by enzymes like penicillinase.

**Pharmacology**: Penicillins generally have good tissue and bile penetration but require frequent dosing due to their short half-life (except Piperacillin). Dosage adjustments are needed for renal insufficiency, with some exceptions.

Penicillins remain crucial antibiotics, though resistance can limit their effectiveness.
