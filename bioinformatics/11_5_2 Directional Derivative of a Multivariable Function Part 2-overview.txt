The text describes a process for finding the directional derivative of a multivariable function \( f(x, y, z) = z - e^x \sin(y) \) in four-dimensional space. Here's a summary:

1. **Function and Point**: The function is defined as \( f(x, y, z) = z - e^x \sin(y) \). We are interested in evaluating at the point \( P = (\ln(3), \frac{3\pi}{2}, -3) \).

2. **Gradient Calculation**:
   - Partial derivative with respect to \( x \): \(-e^x \sin(y)\).
   - Partial derivative with respect to \( y \): \(-e^x \cos(y)\).
   - Partial derivative with respect to \( z \): 1.
   - At point \( P \), the gradient is calculated as:
     \[
     \nabla f(P) = (-3)(-1), (0), (1) = (3, 0, 1)
     \]

3. **Directional Derivative**:
   - The direction vector given is \( \mathbf{v} = (1, 2, 2) \).
   - Convert \( \mathbf{v} \) to a unit vector: 
     \[
     \mathbf{\hat{v}} = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]
   - Compute the dot product of \( \nabla f(P) \) and \( \mathbf{\hat{v}} \):
     \[
     \nabla f(P) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{v}} = 3 \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + 0 \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} + 1 \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]
   - Simplify to get the directional derivative: \( \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3} \).

4. **Maximum and Minimum Rate of Change**:
   - The maximum rate of change occurs in the direction of the gradient, which is \( (3, 0, 1) \).
   - The minimum rate of change occurs in the opposite direction of the gradient, which is \( (-3, 0, -1) \).

This process involves calculating partial derivatives to find the gradient and then using the dot product with a unit vector to determine the directional derivative.

The text discusses finding directions for maximizing and minimizing the rate of change at a point in a multivariable function. The gradient vector given is \( (3, 0, 1) \). 

To find the direction where this rate of change is zero (perpendicular to the gradient), it explains that two vectors are perpendicular when their dot product equals zero. Using an example with unit vectors along the x and y axes, it illustrates how they form a right angle (90 degrees).

For the specific gradient \( (3, 0, 1) \), a vector perpendicular would satisfy \( (a, b, c) \cdot (3, 0, 1) = 0 \). Simplifying this gives \( 3a + c = 0 \), leading to \( a = -\frac{c}{3} \). Choosing \( c = 1 \) results in the vector \( (-\frac{1}{3}, b, 1) \), where \( b \) can be any value because it is multiplied by zero.

The text then moves on to discuss the norm (magnitude) of the gradient, calculated as \( \sqrt{10} \). The maximum rate of change occurs in the direction of the gradient vector (\(0\) degrees from it), which equals \( \sqrt{10} \). Conversely, the minimum rate of change is found in the opposite direction (\(180\) degrees or \(\pi\) radians), giving a value of \(-\sqrt{10}\).

In summary:
- The maximum rate of change at point \( p \) is \( \sqrt{10} \).
- The minimum rate of change is \(-\sqrt{10}\).

The text explains how the cosine function and gradients relate in multivariable calculus. It starts by stating that cosine varies from positive 1 to negative 1, which is significant when determining maximum and minimum values of a function.

Using an example with a function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \), depicted as a three-dimensional parabola along the z-axis, it illustrates calculating partial derivatives. The text explains that to find the rate of change in any direction at a point on this surface, you take the dot product of the gradient of \( f \) with a unit vector pointing in your desired direction.

The angle between the gradient and the chosen direction is crucial because it determines the maximum or minimum rate of increase. When the angle is zero (i.e., the direction aligns with the gradient), the cosine value is 1, giving the maximum rate of increase for the function at that point. Conversely, an angle of 180 degrees indicates moving in the opposite direction, resulting in a maximum decrease.

The text also touches on finding directions where there is no change (zero rate of change) by choosing vectors perpendicular to the gradient vector. This concept extends from single-variable calculus into multivariable contexts, emphasizing that understanding gradients and angles helps determine how functions behave at various points in space.

The text discusses how moving in different directions relative to a curve affects the rate of change. Specifically, it explains:

1. **No Change Direction**: If you move perpendicularly to the tangent at a point on a curve, there is no rate of change. This direction corresponds to being orthogonal (90 degrees) to the gradient vector at that point.

2. **Rate of Change Calculation**: To find this perpendicular direction mathematically, one can use the dot product. The text provides an example where moving in a direction given by a specific vector results in zero rate of change if it is perpendicular to the gradient.

3. **Maximum and Minimum Rate of Change**: Moving along the direction of the gradient gives the maximum rate of change (positive value), while moving opposite to it gives the minimum rate of change (negative value).

4. **Practical Application**: To determine directions with specific rates of change, use the gradient vector and adjust your direction using dot products.

Overall, the text explains how directional movement relative to a curve's tangent can be analyzed using concepts from calculus and linear algebra, focusing on gradients and orthogonality.
