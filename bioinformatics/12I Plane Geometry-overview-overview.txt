The text outlines methods for deriving the equations of planes based on specific geometric conditions, involving vector operations such as cross products:

1. **Plane Through Two Points Perpendicular to Another Plane**:
   - Given points \((-1, 2, 5)\) and \( (2, 1, 4) \).
   - The desired plane is perpendicular to the plane with equation \(8x - 2y + 6z = 1\), whose normal vector is \((8, -2, 6)\).
   - A vector between the two points is \(\mathbf{p_1p_2} = (3, -1, -1)\) and lies in the desired plane.
   - The cross product of \(\mathbf{p_1p_2}\) with the normal vector yields a new normal for the plane: \((4, 13, -1)\).
   - Using this normal vector and one of the points, the equation of the plane is \(4x + 13y - z = 17\).

2. **Plane Through a Point Containing a Line**:
   - The plane passes through \((1, -1, 2)\) and contains the line given by \(x = t\), \(y = t + 1\), \(z = 2t + 3\).
   - A vector parallel to the line is \((1, 1, 2)\).
   - Another point on the plane can be derived from the line (e.g., setting \(t = 0\) gives \((0, 1, 3)\)).
   - The cross product of vectors in the plane provides a normal vector.
   - Using this normal vector and the given point, the equation of the plane is determined.

Additionally, there's a process for finding a vector perpendicular to a plane defined by two points:

- Vectors \(\mathbf{p} = (1, -2, 5)\) and \(\mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 2)\) are used.
- The cross product \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{p}\) yields a perpendicular vector \((3, -3, -3)\).
- This normal vector helps derive the plane equation: \(3x - y - z - 2 = 0\), using a point on the plane \((0, 1, -2)\).

The text emphasizes understanding vector operations to determine geometric properties like a plane's normal vector and its equation.
