We're going to continue with the trigonometric integration using this table that we need to know by heart.
And we're going to look at the example.
And there we go. The indefinite integral of 1 over the square root of x squared minus 4.
Let's make that x squared plus 4x.
So it looks like one of the three that we've got up here.
And there's something that we can remember from high school algebra and that is to complete the square.
For instance if I took the x squared plus 4x here and I wrote x minus 2 squared.
I am going to get x squared minus 4x.
Minus 2 minus 2.
That is...
Let's make it 2 sorry.
x squared plus 4x plus 4.
And there's x squared plus 4x definitely.
So if I just subtract 4 from that minus 4 I'm going to be left with x squared plus 4x.
So let's substitute that.
So I'm going to have the indefinite integral of 1 over the square root of...
I'm going to have x plus 2 squared minus 4 dx.
Now there's something very simple I can do with this.
To change this into something.
To change this part into something.
Because look it's x squared plus 2...
x plus 2 squared minus 4 which is 2 squared.
So I'm very nearly...
I'm very nearly...
Here with this example...
The third example.
The square root of x squared minus a squared.
Let's see.
If I let u equal x plus 2.
Then I'm going to get du dx equal 2.
Well that's very simple.
That is going to be 1.
In other words du equals dx.
Let's substitute that.
Then I'm going to get the indefinite integral of 1 over...
And we're going to get the square root.
Now x plus 2 is now u.
So that is going to be u squared.
And minus 4 will be minus 2 squared.
And very simply dx equals du.
Du.
Now don't get confused because there's a u.
And in our table above there's an x.
So it's definitely now in the form of the third example here.
So we're going to let u equals a secant theta.
So we're going to let u equals a in this instance is 2 secant of theta.
And that's quite simple.
There's something we can certainly...
We can do about that.
We can take the first derivative of that.
That is du d theta.
And that is simply going to be 2.
And remember what the first derivative of the secant of theta is.
That's the secant of theta tangent of theta.
And if we just look at du on its own.
That is going to be 2 secant of theta tangent of theta d theta.
And certainly we can substitute a bit.
Let's do that.
So now we're going to get indefinite integral of 1 over the square root of...
So this is going to be 4 secant squared theta because it's u squared.
Minus 4.
And du is going to be 2 secant theta tangent theta d theta.
What we can do is bring the 4 out as a common denominator.
That's too far.
Okay.
So it's going to be 1 over the square root.
Let's bring 4 out.
So that will leave us with the secant squared of theta minus 1.
All under the square root sign.
Still times 2 times the second of theta tangent of theta d theta.
Now we can certainly do a bit of...
4 is 2 squared.
So we can bring that out as indefinite integral of 1 over...
2 times the square root.
Now secant squared theta minus 1 we know is tangent squared of theta.
From our previous videos.
Still times 2 secant theta...
Tangent sorry of theta d theta.
Now we can certainly do a bit of...
It just keeps on going too far.
We can certainly do a bit of...
We can do that.
Now the square root of the tangent squared of theta is just going to leave us the tangent of theta.
So these are going to cancel out as well.
And what are we left with?
Very simply.
One...
Well that's not one.
That is going to be the secant of theta d theta.
Secant of theta d theta.
And from our...
From one of the previous videos.
This is one of the trigonometric function integrals that we should know.
That's the natural log of the secant of theta plus the tangent of theta indefinite integral.
So plus c.
Let's just look though...
To back substitute.
Now in this instance we don't have to draw our triangles because...
I'll show you now we already have a value for secant of theta and for the tangent of theta.
Let's write this in red.
Let's write this in red.
There we go.
So we know that...
Let's write it here.
We know that u equals...
What did we say?
2 times the secant of theta.
So the secant of theta equals u divided by 2.
U divided by 2.
If we look closely as well.
Here we started with u squared minus 4.
And the square root of that.
Now we did...
And here we are left with...
2 times the tangent of theta.
So these two are still the same.
Sorry.
Machine is a bit slow today.
There we go.
So we know that...
Also on this side we know that...
The square root of...
U squared minus 4...
Equals...
2 times the tangent of theta.
I mean here we have the...
Square root of the tangent squared of theta.
So the square root and the squared cancel out.
So it's the tangent of theta.
So 2 times the tangent of theta.
And that leaves us with the tangent of theta equals...
The square root of u squared minus 4...
Divided by...
2.
So we have values both for the secant and for the tangent of theta.
And we can just substitute that.
I think that went a bit off screen.
What I can try and do is...
Let me just select it.
And bring it in there for you.
That's better.
There we have it.
The value for the secant.
And the value for the tangent.
Let's replace that.
So that is going to be the natural log.
Secant of theta we now have as u over 2.
Plus the tangent of theta is going to be...
Square root of u squared minus 4...
Divided by 2.
All of this plus c.
Now way back in the start.
We substituted.
We used a trigonometric substitution.
And we said...
U equals x plus 2.
So let's put that back into our example.
So we're going to have the natural log of...
X plus 2.
Divided by 2.
Plus the square root u squared.
So this is going to be...
X plus 2 squared.
Minus 4.
Over 2.
Plus c.
So that equals the natural log of...
X plus 2 over 2.
Plus the square root.
This is going to be the x squared plus 4x.
Also divided by 2.
Plus c.
So...
This is a problem where...
We used...
We used our...
Example here.
To substitute back.
But we had to work a bit to get there by doing...
Completion of the square of our problem.
Of our problem as it was set there.
And then...
To reverse our trigonometric substitution.
Fortunately...
If we look closely...
We already had values of secant of theta.
And the tangent of theta.
So we could easily substitute that back.
We had to work a bit...
Perhaps...
But will see...
