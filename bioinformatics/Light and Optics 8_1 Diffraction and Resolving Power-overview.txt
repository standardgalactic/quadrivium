The text provides an explanation of diffraction, a phenomenon where waves bend around obstacles or pass through narrow openings. It specifically discusses sound and electromagnetic wave behavior when encountering barriers with small apertures.

1. **Concept Introduction**: Diffraction involves the bending of waves around corners or through slits, such as sound passing through a door opening in a wall. This is described using Huygens' Principle, which suggests every point on a wave front can act as a source of spherical secondary wavelets.

2. **Application to Waves**:
   - Sound waves bend around a corner when encountering an open door.
   - Electromagnetic waves exhibit similar behavior when passing through slits.
   - The width of the slit (W) and wavelength (\(\lambda\)) must be proportional for noticeable diffraction patterns; larger wavelengths relative to the slit width result in more pronounced diffraction.

3. **Mathematical Description**:
   - For destructive interference, which creates dark fringes, the path difference between waves from different parts of the slit should equal half-integer multiples of the wavelength (\(\frac{m\lambda}{w}\), where \(m\) is an integer).
   - The position of these fringes can be calculated using \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{m\lambda}{w}\).

4. **Practical Example**:
   - A problem involving monochromatic light and a single slit (5 micrometers wide) with the screen 40 centimeters away is posed.
   - The goal is to determine the width of the central bright band, which involves calculating the distance from the centerline to the first dark fringe on either side and then doubling this distance.

The explanation ties the theoretical understanding of diffraction to practical calculations involving light and single slits, reinforcing how wave properties influence observable patterns.

The text discusses how to calculate the distance to a dark fringe in an interference pattern using trigonometry. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: Two angles are both labeled \(\theta\), and two lengths are involved: \(l\) (given) and \(y\) (to be found).

2. **Tangent Relation**: The tangent of \(\theta\) relates the unknown length \(y\) to \(l\) as \(y = l \cdot \tan(\theta)\). We seek \(2y\), leading to the expression \(2y = 2l \cdot \tan(\theta)\).

3. **Finding \(\theta\)**: The angle \(\theta\) is found using the equation \(\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{m \lambda}{w}\right)\), where \(m\) is an integer (1 for the first dark fringe), \(\lambda\) is wavelength, and \(w\) is width.

4. **Equation for 2y**: Substituting \(\theta\) into the expression for \(2y\), we get:
   \[
   2y = 2l \cdot \tan\left(\arcsin\left(\frac{m \lambda}{w}\right)\right)
   \]

5. **Values and Calculations**:
   - For a given setup with specific parameters, \(2y\) is calculated as 65.8 mm.
   - When the width \(W_2\) is halved to 2.5 micrometers, \(2y\) becomes approximately 153 mm.

6. **Important Considerations**:
   - The value of \(m\) is crucial: \(m = 1\) for the first dark fringe.
   - Halving the width increases the distance between fringes, but not exactly doubles it due to the sine and arc-sine functions involved.

The text emphasizes careful attention to problem parameters (like \(m\)) and highlights this as a straightforward application of interference equations.
