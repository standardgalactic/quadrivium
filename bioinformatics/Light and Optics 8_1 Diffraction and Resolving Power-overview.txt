The text provides an explanation of diffraction, a phenomenon where waves bend around obstacles or pass through narrow openings. It specifically discusses sound and electromagnetic wave behavior when encountering barriers with small apertures.

1. **Concept Introduction**: Diffraction involves the bending of waves around corners or through slits, such as sound passing through a door opening in a wall. This is described using Huygens' Principle, which suggests every point on a wave front can act as a source of spherical secondary wavelets.

2. **Application to Waves**:
   - Sound waves bend around a corner when encountering an open door.
   - Electromagnetic waves exhibit similar behavior when passing through slits.
   - The width of the slit (W) and wavelength (\(\lambda\)) must be proportional for noticeable diffraction patterns; larger wavelengths relative to the slit width result in more pronounced diffraction.

3. **Mathematical Description**:
   - For destructive interference, which creates dark fringes, the path difference between waves from different parts of the slit should equal half-integer multiples of the wavelength (\(\frac{m\lambda}{w}\), where \(m\) is an integer).
   - The position of these fringes can be calculated using \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{m\lambda}{w}\).

4. **Practical Example**:
   - A problem involving monochromatic light and a single slit (5 micrometers wide) with the screen 40 centimeters away is posed.
   - The goal is to determine the width of the central bright band, which involves calculating the distance from the centerline to the first dark fringe on either side and then doubling this distance.

The explanation ties the theoretical understanding of diffraction to practical calculations involving light and single slits, reinforcing how wave properties influence observable patterns.

The text discusses how to calculate the distance to a dark fringe in an interference pattern using trigonometry. Here's a summary:

1. **Setup**: Two angles are both labeled \(\theta\), and two lengths are involved: \(l\) (given) and \(y\) (to be found).

2. **Tangent Relation**: The tangent of \(\theta\) relates the unknown length \(y\) to \(l\) as \(y = l \cdot \tan(\theta)\). We seek \(2y\), leading to the expression \(2y = 2l \cdot \tan(\theta)\).

3. **Finding \(\theta\)**: The angle \(\theta\) is found using the equation \(\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{m \lambda}{w}\right)\), where \(m\) is an integer (1 for the first dark fringe), \(\lambda\) is wavelength, and \(w\) is width.

4. **Equation for 2y**: Substituting \(\theta\) into the expression for \(2y\), we get:
   \[
   2y = 2l \cdot \tan\left(\arcsin\left(\frac{m \lambda}{w}\right)\right)
   \]

5. **Values and Calculations**:
   - For a given setup with specific parameters, \(2y\) is calculated as 65.8 mm.
   - When the width \(W_2\) is halved to 2.5 micrometers, \(2y\) becomes approximately 153 mm.

6. **Important Considerations**:
   - The value of \(m\) is crucial: \(m = 1\) for the first dark fringe.
   - Halving the width increases the distance between fringes, but not exactly doubles it due to the sine and arc-sine functions involved.

The text emphasizes careful attention to problem parameters (like \(m\)) and highlights this as a straightforward application of interference equations.

The text introduces the concept of diffraction, particularly focusing on how waves behave when encountering obstacles such as walls with openings. The discussion begins with sound waves bending around a corner due to an open door in a wallâ€”a phenomenon explained through Huygens' Principle (pronounced as "Hoygens" or "Rufens"). According to this principle, every point on a wave front acts as a source of spherical wavelets that spread out and interfere. This interference can cause the wave fronts to bend around obstacles.

The text extends this concept to electromagnetic waves and highlights how they exhibit diffraction when passing through slits. It explains that for diffraction to be noticeable, there must be a proportional relationship between the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) and the slit width (W). When light passes through such a slit, it forms an interference pattern on a screen placed at some distance from the slit. The central bright band in this pattern is flanked by dark fringes where destructive interference occurs.

The mathematical description provided relates to calculating these positions of minima (dark fringes) using the equation \(\sin(\theta) = m\lambda/W\), where \(m\) is an integer representing the order of the fringe. The text emphasizes that diffraction patterns are only observable when the slit width is comparable to the wavelength of light.

The example problem involves monochromatic light passing through a single slit with a specified width and screen distance, asking for the calculation of the central bright band's width. This involves determining the position of the first dark fringe on either side of the central maximum and using geometry to find the total width across the central band.

The text discusses a method to calculate the distance \(2y\) to the first dark fringe in an interference pattern using trigonometry and wave optics concepts. Here's a summary:

1. **Definitions**: 
   - \(\theta\) is defined as the angle related to the position of the dark fringes.
   - \(y\) represents half the distance between two points on the screen where the first dark fringe occurs, so the task is to find \(2y\).

2. **Equations**:
   - The tangent function relates \(\theta\) with \(y\): \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{l}\), leading to \(y = l \cdot \tan(\theta)\).
   - For a dark fringe, the angle \(\theta\) is given by \(\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{m \lambda}{w}\right)\).

3. **Substitution**:
   - Substitute \(\theta\) into the equation for \(y\) to get \(2y = 2l \cdot \tan\left(\arcsin\left(\frac{m \lambda}{w}\right)\right)\).

4. **Special Cases**:
   - For the first dark fringe, use \(m = 1\).
   - Note that for dark fringes, use integer values of \(m\) (0, 1, 2, etc.), while bright fringes use half-integer values.

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - With specific parameters (\(\lambda = 5 \mu m\), \(w = 5 \mu m\)), the calculated distance \(2y\) is approximately 65.8 mm.
   - Halving \(w\) to 2.5 \(\mu m\) results in \(2y\) increasing to about 153 mm, indicating larger bright bands.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - This method provides a straightforward way to determine the distance to dark fringes using trigonometric relationships and wave interference principles.
   - Caution is advised when dealing with changes in parameters due to non-linear effects from functions like \(\arcsin\).
