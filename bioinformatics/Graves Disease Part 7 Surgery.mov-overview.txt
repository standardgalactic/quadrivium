The video discusses the role of surgery, specifically thyroidectomy, as a treatment option for Graves' disease. Surgery is rarely used due to its risks but can be considered under certain conditions such as patient preference, in children and adolescents, pregnant women, large thyroid glands causing physical or cosmetic issues, presence of ophthalmopathy, allergy to thionomides, or suspicion of thyroid malignancy. While there are risks like scarring, bleeding, infection, laryngeal nerve injury, and parathyroid damage (which occur up to 10% of the time), meticulous surgical techniques can minimize these risks.

Total thyroidectomy is preferred by many experts today. Before surgery, patients typically undergo preparation with thionomides, beta blockers, and inorganic iodide to manage hyperthyroidism safely. Surgery provides definitive treatment for hyperthyroidism, avoids radiation exposure, allows for accurate histological examination, and remains a valid option when used judiciously.
