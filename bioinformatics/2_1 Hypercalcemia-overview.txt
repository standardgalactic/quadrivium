This text provides an overview of the causes of hypercalcemia, focusing on its classification based on bone resorption, gastrointestinal (GIT) calcium absorption, and miscellaneous causes. Hypercalcemia occurs when the entry of calcium into circulation from sources like the GIT or bone surpasses urinary excretion or bone deposition.

Key points include:

1. **Primary Causes**: 
   - Primary hyperparathyroidism leads to elevated or episodic calcium levels due to parathyroid hormone (PTH) activating osteoclasts for bone resorption and increasing calcium absorption in the GIT.
   - Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism are linked with renal failure, where chronic kidney disease can eventually cause hypercalcemia when PTH becomes autonomous.

2. **Bone Resorption**:
   - Malignancies (solid tumors, leukemias, lymphomas) may cause bone resorption through direct invasion or cytokine release.
   - Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in non-metastatic malignancy and increased calcitriol in some lymphomas contribute to hypercalcemia.
   - Other causes include thyrotoxicosis, immobilization, certain diseases like Pagetâ€™s disease, drugs like tamoxifen, and hypervitaminosis A.

3. **Calcium Absorption in the GIT**:
   - Active absorption is regulated by vitamin D metabolites, while passive absorption can occur with large intakes.
   - Hypercalcemia due to increased calcium intake typically requires renal impairment.
   - Chronic kidney disease leads to hyperphosphatemia and decreased calcitriol production, causing hypocalcemia unless countered by treatments like oral calcium supplements or calcitriol.

4. **Miscellaneous Causes**:
   - These include lithium use, thiazide diuretics, pheochromocytoma, adrenal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, theophylline toxicity, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, and congenital lactase deficiency.

Overall, primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer are major contributors to hypercalcemia cases. The text emphasizes understanding how various diseases affect calcium balance through different mechanisms involving the parathyroid glands, bones, kidneys, and GIT.

### Summary of Hypercalcemia Causes

**Overview:**
Hypercalcemia occurs when calcium entry into the bloodstream from sources like the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) or bone exceeds urinary excretion or bone deposition.

**Classification of Causes:**

1. **Bone Resorption:**
   - **Primary Hyperparathyroidism:** Characterized by normal to high calcium levels, sometimes episodic. Parathyroid hormone activates osteoclasts for bone resorption and increases GIT absorption.
   - **Secondary/Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism:** Often associated with renal failure, initially showing low or normal calcium levels due to increased phosphate and reduced vitamin D activation. Over time, especially post-renal transplant, hypercalcemia may occur if parathyroid hormone becomes autonomous.

2. **Malignancy:**
   - Solid tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas can lead to bone resorption through direct invasion or cytokine release. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and calcitriol elevation in certain cancers also contribute.

3. **Other Factors:**
   - Thyrotoxicosis (15-20% of cases), immobilization, Paget's disease, tamoxifen, and hypervitaminosis A can increase bone resorption.
   
4. **GIT Calcium Absorption:**
   - Normally regulated by vitamin D metabolites but can be increased with high calcium intake, especially in renal impairment.
   - Chronic kidney disease often leads to hypocalcemia due to hyperphosphatemia and reduced calcitriol; however, oral calcium supplements can cause hypercalcemia if combined with bone disease or active vitamin D.

5. **Miscellaneous Causes:**
   - Include lithium use, thiazide diuretics, pheochromocytoma, adrenal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, theophylline toxicity, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, and congenital lactase deficiency.

**Vitamin D Metabolism:**
- Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol via UV light. It is converted to calcitriol in the liver and kidney but impaired in renal failure, affecting calcium regulation.

This summary outlines the primary mechanisms and conditions leading to hypercalcemia, emphasizing the roles of bone resorption, GIT absorption, and various diseases or medications.
