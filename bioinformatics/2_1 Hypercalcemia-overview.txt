This text provides an overview of the causes of hypercalcemia, focusing on its classification based on bone resorption, gastrointestinal (GIT) calcium absorption, and miscellaneous causes. Hypercalcemia occurs when the entry of calcium into circulation from sources like the GIT or bone surpasses urinary excretion or bone deposition.

Key points include:

1. **Primary Causes**: 
   - Primary hyperparathyroidism leads to elevated or episodic calcium levels due to parathyroid hormone (PTH) activating osteoclasts for bone resorption and increasing calcium absorption in the GIT.
   - Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism are linked with renal failure, where chronic kidney disease can eventually cause hypercalcemia when PTH becomes autonomous.

2. **Bone Resorption**:
   - Malignancies (solid tumors, leukemias, lymphomas) may cause bone resorption through direct invasion or cytokine release.
   - Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in non-metastatic malignancy and increased calcitriol in some lymphomas contribute to hypercalcemia.
   - Other causes include thyrotoxicosis, immobilization, certain diseases like Pagetâ€™s disease, drugs like tamoxifen, and hypervitaminosis A.

3. **Calcium Absorption in the GIT**:
   - Active absorption is regulated by vitamin D metabolites, while passive absorption can occur with large intakes.
   - Hypercalcemia due to increased calcium intake typically requires renal impairment.
   - Chronic kidney disease leads to hyperphosphatemia and decreased calcitriol production, causing hypocalcemia unless countered by treatments like oral calcium supplements or calcitriol.

4. **Miscellaneous Causes**:
   - These include lithium use, thiazide diuretics, pheochromocytoma, adrenal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, theophylline toxicity, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, and congenital lactase deficiency.

Overall, primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer are major contributors to hypercalcemia cases. The text emphasizes understanding how various diseases affect calcium balance through different mechanisms involving the parathyroid glands, bones, kidneys, and GIT.
