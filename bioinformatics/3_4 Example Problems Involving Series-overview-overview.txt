The text analyzes the convergence of the infinite series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{k(k+2)}\) using several mathematical methods:

1. **Limit Comparison Test**: The test indicates potential convergence because the limit of the terms as \(k\) approaches infinity is zero.

2. **Partial Fractions Decomposition**: The series is decomposed into:
   \[
   \frac{4}{k(k+2)} = \frac{2}{k} - \frac{2}{k+2}
   \]
   This transformation allows the series to be expressed as a telescoping series.

3. **Telescoping Series**: By rewriting and examining the series term by term, many intermediate terms cancel out:
   \[
   S_n = 2 + 1 - \frac{2}{n+1} - \frac{2}{n+2}
   \]

4. **Convergence Analysis**: As \(n\) approaches infinity, the remaining terms \(-\frac{2}{n+1}\) and \(-\frac{2}{n+2}\) approach zero. Therefore, the series converges to 3.

In summary, through partial fraction decomposition and the telescoping nature of the series, it is shown that the infinite series converges to a value of 3.
