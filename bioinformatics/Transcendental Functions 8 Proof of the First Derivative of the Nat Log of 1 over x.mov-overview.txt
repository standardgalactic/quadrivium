The video explains a mathematical proof demonstrating that the first derivative of the natural logarithm of \(x\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\). This proof involves several steps, some of which may not be immediately intuitive.

To begin, it establishes the need for understanding one particular definition of Euler's number (\(e\)), given by the limit:

\[ e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n. \]

The proof then approaches finding the derivative \( \frac{d}{dx}(\ln x) \) using limits, rewriting it as:

\[ \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\ln(x + \Delta x) - \ln x}{\Delta x}. \]

By employing logarithmic properties, this becomes:

\[ \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{1}{\Delta x} \ln \left(1 + \frac{\Delta x}{x}\right). \]

To simplify the expression further, a substitution is made: \(\frac{\Delta x}{x} = \frac{1}{n}\), which implies \(\Delta x = \frac{x}{n}\). As \(\Delta x\) approaches 0, \(n\) must approach infinity. This leads to:

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\Delta x} \ln \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right), \]

where \(\frac{1}{\Delta x} = \frac{n}{x}\). Substituting these into the expression results in:

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{x} \ln \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n. \]

Using logarithm laws, this can be rewritten as:

\[ \frac{1}{x} \cdot \lim_{n \to \infty} n \ln \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right). \]

Recognizing the limit part of this expression as the definition of \(e\), it simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{x} \cdot \ln(e) = \frac{1}{x}. \]

Thus, confirming that the derivative of \(\ln x\) is indeed \(\frac{1}{x}\). The proof involves several non-intuitive steps and manipulations but ultimately relies on understanding limits and properties of logarithms.
