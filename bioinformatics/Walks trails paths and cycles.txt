So I think I've shown you so many graphs and I'm sure you've explored some of your own in Mathematica
So whether you have the desktop version or you're just using it free of charge on the Mathematica cloud server itself on the web
Now I'm sure I'm sure you've seen the beauty of all of these graphs
So let's move on to something slightly different and we're going to discuss these things
The first one is called a walk and a walk just means I go from node
To another node, to another node, maybe back to that same node, maybe back to that same node
Then to that node, then to that node, then back to that node, then back to that node
So I've just taken a walk. I don't care if I go along the same path again in whichever direction
I don't care that I go to another node and I visit that node again doesn't matter
A trail is something a bit different. In a trail I might visit
The same node again, but I don't revisit an edge
I don't revisit an edge
A closed one just means I start and end this trail
No edges repeated at the same node
My start node and my end node is exactly the same node
A path is even more restrictive
There I'm not going to revisit any nodes or edges
So I'm going to go, but I can never go where I've been before
So that would be a path
Now in a connected graph, I can, it's this term
Slightly separate from these, it just really means that I can visit
Every node in my graph while following an edge
There's not a set of disconnected vertices or nodes
Which I cannot get to by following
So it stands slightly separate from this, but just see this connected
And then usually one of these edges is called a bridge
Or there might be more than one bridge
If I remove that, then there's a set of vertices or a vertex
That I cannot get to that makes it disconnected
So it's usually brought in here, but just see it stands slightly separate from that
So walk, I'm just walking randomly
Trail, I can visit the same nodes again, but not the edges
If I start and stop at the same one, it's closed
And the path is I cannot repeat anything
Not a node, I can't revisit a node
And I can't go past the same edge again
A cycle is then just this idea of a closed walk
So I'm going to go all the way, all the way, all the way
And just get back to where I started
So this beginning and end is the exact same
So I've gone in a cycle
You can, like Amala mentioned
Remember when we had the cycle graphs
That will be a beautiful example of a cycle
So let's go and just visually explore the definition of these things inside of Mathematica
So here we are in Mathematica
And I've prepared this little section here
Part actually of notes that I keep on the subject
So I have here paths and cycles
And let's just go through this
Some text that I've written here in this cell
Just so that we are clear about these definitions
And you really have to memorize these
They've got to become part of your normal vocabulary
So that you understand what these things are
So a walk is the movement from one node to another
By way of the edges that are incident upon them
So I'm just going from node to node
That is simply the act of moving along a graph
And there's no concern
About repeating or omitting the nodes or the edges
And we can be more discerning about we move along a graph
And not repeat any edges
And that is called a trail
And we can be even more discerning
Which is then a path
In which all the vertices and the edges are unique
So I cannot repeat any of them
A connected graph is then a graph
In which there's a path between all pairs of vertices
A bridge is then a special edge
In that if it is removed
The graph becomes disconnected
Every disconnected graph
Can be split up into a number of connected subgraphs
In this case the subgraphs are called components
So let's look at this graph
So what you see here is this text cell
A code cell I should say
And what you can see here
These little parentheses
And then two stars
And anything in between is called a code comment
And that is just totally ignored by the Wolfram language
It's this code that you can put there
Little comments to yourself
Or to someone else who sees your code
So I'm creating this computer variable g
I'm creating this graph
With vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
And we have this undirected edges
Between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4
And then 4 and 5
So you can clearly see this is a disconnected graph
Because if I am on 1, 2, 3
There's no ways I can get to 4, 5
And I can actually use
The connected graph Q
That's a question
Is G a connected graph
And I get the result
Which says it is false
That is not a connected graph
But we can see 4 and 5
That's a connected graph
1, 2 and 3
It's a connected graph
Because I can actually use this
Connected components function
Or keyword past the argument G
And it'll tell me
1, 2 and 3 here
The order there doesn't matter
And 4 and 5
Those will be two components
And they will be completely connected
Now let's look at this graph G
That I've constructed here
1 to 2
1 to 6
2 to 3
2 and 5
2 and 6
3 and 4
3 and 5
4 and 5
5 and 6
6 and 6
And 6 and 1
With the vertex labels
And there's the representation
Of this graph G
So a closed walk
Is a walk that begins
And ends at the same vertex
And that's very similar
To a closed trail
Remember now
It's just about
The trail
Then these edges
Not being repeated
If I don't start
And end at the same one
Both of these
That'd just be open
An open walk
An open trail
A cycle
Is then a closed walk
So I'm going to start
And begin at the same one
So that one can be repeated
So don't make that mistake
If I start and end
And it's a cycle
You know
Or closed
That is a repeat
Of a node
That is allowed
So a cycle
Is a closed walk
In which all the edges
Are different
And all the intermediate
Vertices are different
So that's a very special walk
I'm going to start
And end at the same one
But it's like a path
So I'm not repeating
Any nodes or edges
Except the first
And the last one
So here it is
Let's have a look
So let's just walk
As I've written down here
From 2
To 5
To 3
To 4
To 5
To 6
To 2
So I started
And ended
At the same
So this is closed
But I repeated
5
So I did repeat
5
And
But I didn't repeat
Any edges
So
You know
I could see this
As a walk
But also as a trail
Because none of these edges
Let's just go again
Let's just make sure
2
To 5
To 3
To 4
To 5
Back to 2
Okay so
To 6
To 2 at least
So the edges were not
I did not
Repeat any of the edges
Now if we walk
Now if we walk
Now if we walk from
6 to 6
To 6
To 6
All we have
We actually have
A closed walk
And it is indeed
A cycle
Because I
You know
I have not
Repeated any of my edges
And I
It's closed
Because I start
And I end
At the same vertex
And by definition
As I say here
That is not
You know
That is not repeating
That
It's just the start
And the end
Now let's take
This other one
I walk from
1
To 2
To 3
To 4
To 5
To 6
And back
Back to 1
That is a cycle
Because I didn't
Repeat any of the nodes
Or edges
And I start
And stop
At the same
At the same
Vertex
Just a little one here
Which I didn't
Discuss on the board
A cycle
Such as the walk
From 2
To 5
To 6
And 2
So 2
5
6
And 2
That is also called
A triangle
So play around
With these
Try and create these
Figure out
By these definitions
What would be
You know
Walk
Which is very simple
A trail
A path
What is a connected graph
And a disconnected graph
You can check that
You can check the components
Of
Of
A graph
As we said here
The connected components
Of G
If it is a disconnected graph
And then
Look at cycles
That you can find
Inside of
Graphs
That you do
Construct
