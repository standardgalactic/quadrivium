The text provides an explanation of operations involving matrices containing complex numbers:

1. **Matrix Addition**: Two \(2 \times 2\) matrices are added by simply adding their corresponding components. For example:
   - \((1 + i) + (1 - 2i) = 2 - i\)
   - \((-i) + (-3i) = -4i\)

2. **Scalar Multiplication**: A complex scalar \(i\) is multiplied with a matrix by distributing it across each element of the matrix:
   - For an element like \(1\), multiplying by \(i\) gives \(i\).
   - For \(-i\), multiplying by \(i\) results in \(i^2 = -1\).

3. **Matrix Multiplication**: The text explains the process for multiplying two \(2 \times 2\) matrices using complex numbers, ensuring to correctly handle operations involving \(i\) (where \(i^2 = -1\)). It involves:
   - Calculating each element of the resulting matrix by taking the dot product of rows and columns.
   - Keeping track of real and imaginary parts separately to avoid confusion.

4. **Simplification**: After performing the multiplications, simplify expressions involving powers of \(i\) (e.g., \(i^2 = -1\)) to obtain the final result.

The key takeaway is to carefully manage operations between real and imaginary components, ensuring proper addition, subtraction, and multiplication rules for complex numbers.
