The video discusses two major components of plasma used in medical treatments: Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Cryoprecipitate. Here's a summary:

### Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)
- **Production**: Derived from whole blood, frozen at -18 to -30°C within 8 hours; contains all coagulation factors and other proteins.
- **Storage & Usage**: Usable for one year; typically around 250 ml per unit. It is slightly diluted by citrate anticoagulant.
- **Specific Indications**:
  - Hemostasis when coagulation factor activity is below 25% (without inhibitors like heparin and adequate fibrinogen).
  - Used for inherited factor deficiencies, such as factor XI deficiency or factor V in severe DIC after other treatments fail.
  - Suitable for conditions with multiple coagulation factor deficiencies, warfarin overdose, vitamin K deficiency, liver failure, and dilutional coagulopathy from massive transfusions.
- **Contraindications**: Not recommended for primary therapy of specific defects (e.g., hemophilia), correcting INRs <2, volume expansion, or as a nutrient source.
- **Side Effects**: Includes immune reactions requiring ABO compatibility testing, disease transmission risk, volume overload, febrile and anaphylactic reactions, and transfusion-related acute lung injury.

### Cryoprecipitate
- **Production**: Obtained by thawing FFP at about 4°C; the precipitate is centrifuged out.
- **Components**: Contains Factor VIII, fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor. From one unit of FFP, it yields 10-20 ml of cryoprecipitate.
- **Indications & Risks**: 
  - Used for deficiencies in factors present within it (excluding vitamin K-dependent factors).
  - Risks are similar to those associated with FFP.

The video emphasizes the importance of using these plasma components judiciously, based on specific medical needs and conditions.

The text discusses the use of cryoprecipitate, particularly focusing on its content and application. One unit of cryo contains about 200 mg of fibrinogen and approximately 100 units of Factor VIII. Administering 10 units can increase fibrinogen levels by roughly 70 mg per deciliter.

Cryoprecipitate is used for treating congenital or acquired deficiencies in fibrinogen and Factor XIII. It's particularly beneficial in trauma patients with consumptive coagulopathy, where fibrinogen levels are insufficient despite adequate Factor activity (25-30%), leading to ineffective clotting. Additionally, it can be crucial for managing von Willebrandt’s disease when no other sources of von Willebrandt factor are available and in urgent situations like uremic bleeds.

This text outlines the production, use, and considerations associated with two major blood product components: fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate.

**Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP):**
- **Production:** Derived from whole blood frozen at -18 to -30 degrees Celsius within 8 hours. Contains all coagulation factors and proteins present in the original unit of whole blood, diluted by citrate anticoagulation.
- **Usage:** FFP is often overused; specific indications include managing hemostasis when coagulation factor activity is low (25-30%) without inhibitors like heparin, treating inherited factor deficiencies, severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multiple coagulation factor deficiencies due to conditions such as warfarin overdose or liver failure, and dilutional coagulopathy from massive transfusions.
- **Contraindications:** Not indicated for primary therapy of specific coagulation defects like hemophilia A or correcting INRs less than 2. Should not be used for volume expansion in trauma settings or as a nutrient source.
- **Risks/Side Effects:** Requires ABO identical or compatible matching to prevent immune reactions; risks include disease transmission, volume overload, febrile and anaphylactic reactions, and transfusion-related acute lung injury.

**Cryoprecipitate:**
- **Production:** Obtained by thawing FFP at about 4 degrees Celsius, collecting the precipitate, which contains Factor VIII, fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor.
- **Usage:** Useful for deficiencies in factors found within it (e.g., hemophilia A), but not suitable for issues related to vitamin K deficiency or warfarin problems as these remain in the plasma-poor fluid after cryoprecipitate removal.
- **Risks/Side Effects:** Similar risks to FFP, including immune reactions and other transfusion-related complications.

Overall, both FFP and cryoprecipitate have specific roles in managing coagulation disorders but require careful consideration of indications and potential side effects.

The text discusses the use of cryoprecipitate, specifically highlighting that one unit contains approximately 200 mg of fibrinogen and 100 units of Factor VIII. Administering 10 units can increase fibrinogen levels by about 70 mg per deciliter.

Cryoprecipitate is utilized in situations involving congenital or acquired deficiencies of fibrinogen and Factor XIII. It is particularly beneficial for trauma patients experiencing a consumptive coagulopathy, where even with 25-30% Factor activity, clotting may be inadequate due to insufficient fibrinogen levels. Additionally, it can be used for treating von Willebrandt's disease when other treatments are unavailable or in cases of urgent bleeding related to uremia.
