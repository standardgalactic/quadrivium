The video discusses two major components of plasma used in medical treatments: Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Cryoprecipitate. Here's a summary:

### Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)
- **Production**: Derived from whole blood, frozen at -18 to -30°C within 8 hours; contains all coagulation factors and other proteins.
- **Storage & Usage**: Usable for one year; typically around 250 ml per unit. It is slightly diluted by citrate anticoagulant.
- **Specific Indications**:
  - Hemostasis when coagulation factor activity is below 25% (without inhibitors like heparin and adequate fibrinogen).
  - Used for inherited factor deficiencies, such as factor XI deficiency or factor V in severe DIC after other treatments fail.
  - Suitable for conditions with multiple coagulation factor deficiencies, warfarin overdose, vitamin K deficiency, liver failure, and dilutional coagulopathy from massive transfusions.
- **Contraindications**: Not recommended for primary therapy of specific defects (e.g., hemophilia), correcting INRs <2, volume expansion, or as a nutrient source.
- **Side Effects**: Includes immune reactions requiring ABO compatibility testing, disease transmission risk, volume overload, febrile and anaphylactic reactions, and transfusion-related acute lung injury.

### Cryoprecipitate
- **Production**: Obtained by thawing FFP at about 4°C; the precipitate is centrifuged out.
- **Components**: Contains Factor VIII, fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor. From one unit of FFP, it yields 10-20 ml of cryoprecipitate.
- **Indications & Risks**: 
  - Used for deficiencies in factors present within it (excluding vitamin K-dependent factors).
  - Risks are similar to those associated with FFP.

The video emphasizes the importance of using these plasma components judiciously, based on specific medical needs and conditions.

The text discusses the use of cryoprecipitate, particularly focusing on its content and application. One unit of cryo contains about 200 mg of fibrinogen and approximately 100 units of Factor VIII. Administering 10 units can increase fibrinogen levels by roughly 70 mg per deciliter.

Cryoprecipitate is used for treating congenital or acquired deficiencies in fibrinogen and Factor XIII. It's particularly beneficial in trauma patients with consumptive coagulopathy, where fibrinogen levels are insufficient despite adequate Factor activity (25-30%), leading to ineffective clotting. Additionally, it can be crucial for managing von Willebrandt’s disease when no other sources of von Willebrandt factor are available and in urgent situations like uremic bleeds.
