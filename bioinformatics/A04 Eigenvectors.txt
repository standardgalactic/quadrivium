So this is where we left off. I just want to remind you there should be a negative 2 there.
I'm not sure that where I left off previously, which was not today. There should be a negative 2 there.
So we're still trying to solve this set of linear differential equations.
And we were kind enough to have been given the two answers.
That's what we're trying to get to.
The two most important things to remember while trying to solve this, of course, are these two.
Let me move that way.
This matrix A, which is there, minus lambda I.
Remember, that's a scalar.
Just multiplying it by this identity matrix.
So it's matrix minus matrix times this matrix K is going to be equal 0.
And the way to get to my eigenvalues was this determinant of A minus lambda I should be 0.
That's how I got to these characteristic values.
This is a 2 by 2 matrix there.
There are two unknowns we're dealing with.
So we're always going to get two eigenvalues there.
So with that in mind, we now go to this equation here.
And what that suggests is, well, let's have lambda sub 1, which is going to equal negative 2.
So let's see what we can get.
A minus lambda I.
So that would be 1, 3, 5, 3.
And I subtract from that this lambda I.
But lambda sub 1 is now negative 2.
So that will be negative 2, 0, 0, negative 2.
And from that I'm going to get the matrix.
1 minus negative 2, that's 3.
3 minus 0 is 0.
5 minus 0 is 5.
And 3 minus negative 2 is, what am I doing?
3 and 5.
So that is my A minus lambda sub 1 I.
And I've got to multiply that with this 2 by 2 matrix K.
And remember, K sub I, that would just going to be K1 and K2 in this instance.
Remember that K was this long list of the possible values there.
So I've got to multiply these two.
A minus, so this one, multiplied by this 2 by 2 matrix times a 2 by 1 matrix.
It's going to give me a 2 by 1 matrix.
So let's do that in whichever way you want.
A 3, a 3, a 5, a 5.
And we're going to multiply this with K sub 1 and K sub 2.
If I multiply that, I'm going to get 3 times K sub 1 plus 3 times K sub 2.
Or 5 times K sub 1 plus 5 times K sub 2.
And this is going to be the matrix multiplication that I get there.
Now, when I write 0 like this, but remember this is the 0 vector.
The 0 column vector there, the 0 matrix.
So 0, 0.
So this is going to equal 0, 0.
So either of these, I can see 3 times K sub 1 plus 3 times K sub 2 is going to equal 0.
And I can just take out 3 as a common factor.
So K sub 1 plus K sub 2 is going to equal 0.
So I might as well just let K sub 1.
If K sub 1 equals 1, that means K sub 2 is going to equal negative 1.
Now, I can choose anything.
I could have chosen K sub 1 to be 2.
But try and keep things simple.
So there's my first values for K sub 1 and K sub 2.
So, and this makes up this case of 1 that equals 1 negative 1.
Those are my, that is my eigen, my first eigen vector from this, these characteristic values or eigen values.
I get this eigen vector 1 negative 1.
And lo and behold, there it was 1 negative 1 e to the power negative 2.
So, what does this mean?
It means that X equals e to the power negative 2t and Y equals e to the power negative 1, negative e to the power negative 2t.
So that is X sub 1 equals this equals that.
And if I were to take these and differentiate them, I'm going to get back to this.
I'm going to get back to this.
Now, let's just use lambda sub 2 just to see if we can get to the other answer.
Remember, that was 6.
So, I'm going to have what was 3, 1, 3, 5, 3.
And subtract from that 6, 6, 0.
Subtract that from that 1 minus that's negative 5, 3, 5, negative 3.
So, that's that.
And I've got to multiply that by my new case of 1 and case of 2.
Let's call that case of 3 and case of 4.
So, I'm going to be left with negative 5 times case of 3 plus 3 times case of 4.
It's going to equal 0.
This comes exactly from here.
In other words, I'm going to have the fact that 5 times case of 3 equals 3 times case of 4.
Or case of 3 is going to equal 3 fifths of case of 4.
So, if I let case of 4 equal 5, that means case of 3 is going to equal 3.
So, my second eigenvector is going to be 3, 5, 3, 5.
Lo and behold, 3, 5 exactly what it was there.
So, these are quite simple to solve.
