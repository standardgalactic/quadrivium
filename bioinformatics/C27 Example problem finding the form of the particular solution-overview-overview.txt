The provided text outlines a method for solving non-homogeneous higher-order linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients using the annihilator method. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Auxiliary Equation**: The equation's auxiliary form is \( m^3 - 4m^2 + 4m = 0 \), which factors to \( m(m-2)^2 = 0 \). This gives roots \( m_1 = 0 \) and \( m_2 = m_3 = 2 \).

2. **Complementary Solution**: The complementary solution is:
   \[
   y_c = c_1 + c_2 e^{2x} + c_3 x e^{2x}
   \]

3. **Annihilator Approach**: To find a particular solution, annihilators are applied to the non-homogeneous part:
   - \( L_1 = d^3 \)
   - \( L_2 = (d-2)^3 \)
   - \( L_3 = (d-5) \)

4. **Extended Auxiliary Equation**: The extended auxiliary equation includes roots:
   - Four zeros: \( m_1 = m_2 = m_3 = m_4 = 0 \)
   - Five twos: \( m_5 = m_6 = m_7 = m_8 = m_9 = 2 \)
   - One five: \( m_{10} = 5 \)

5. **General Solution**: The general solution is:
   \[
   y = c_1 + c_2 x + c_3 e^{0x} + c_4 x^2 + c_5 x^3 + c_6 e^{2x} + c_7 x e^{2x} + c_8 x^2 e^{2x} + c_9 x^3 e^{2x} + c_{10} e^{5x}
   \]

6. **Particular Solution**: The particular solution is:
   \[
   y_p = ax + bx^2 + cx^3
   \]
   These terms are chosen because they appear in the general solution but not in the complementary solution.

The text also describes a complex mathematical expression \( x^2 e^{2x} + f x^3 e^{2x} + g x^4 e^{2x} + h e^{5x} \), noting the challenge of differentiating it three times for substitution into another equation. The author emphasizes the complexity and importance of clear communication in solving such problems.
