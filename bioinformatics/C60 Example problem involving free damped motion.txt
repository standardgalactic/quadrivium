Let's have a look at this problem. This will be a case 1 problem.
Now, we see that it's homogeneous, linear, constant coefficients.
We can write the auxiliary equation. We're just going to say m squared plus 5m plus 4 equals 0.
And I get that from the fact that I can write this in differential form.
d squared plus d plus 4 of x. 5d, I should say. There we go.
Now, this solves simply into m plus 4 and m plus 1 equals 0.
So, m sub 1 equals negative 4. m sub 2 equals negative 1.
In other words, the x and t is going to be c sub 1 e to the power negative 4t and c sub 2 e to the power negative t.
I know what x sub 0 is. If I put a 0 in there, this becomes 1.
If I put a 0 there, that becomes 1. So, c plus 1 plus c sub 2 and that's got to equal 1.
In other words, c sub 2 equals 1 minus c sub 1.
Now, if I get the x prime of t of this, it's going to be negative 4 c sub 1 e to the power negative 4t.
Negative c sub 2 e to the power negative t.
And x prime of x prime of 0. So, that's negative 4 times c sub 1.
And if I put a 0 in there, that's 1 minus c sub 2.
And c sub 2, I know, is 1 minus c sub 1 and that's going to equal 1.
So, negative 4 times c sub 1 minus 1 plus c sub 1 is going to equal 1.
So, it's minus 3 times c sub 1 is going to equal 2.
c sub 1 equals negative 2 over 3, leaving c sub 2 as 1 minus that.
So, it's 3 over 3 minus negative 2 over 3 and that is 5 over 3.
In other words, x in t is going to equal c sub 1 is negative 2 over 3 e to the power negative 4t.
And c sub 2 is positive 5 over 3 e to the power negative t.
So, that was a simple one to do.
I think, to save some time, we might as well go on to this problem.
Let's have a look here.
This will be a problem where we have critical damping.
Again, I can write the auxiliary equation because I can write this in differential form,
which will be d squared plus 8d plus 16 of x equals 0.
In other words, m squared plus 8m plus 16 is equal 0.
So, it's going to be an m plus 4 squared equals 0.
Let's just see.
Yeah, that's going to be that.
In other words, m sub 1 equals m sub 2 equals negative 4.
And I'm going to have the fact that the x of t is going to be c sub 1 e to the power negative 4t
plus c sub 2 e to the power negative 4t.
And I mustn't forget my extra t, which should have gone in there.
Now, x of 0, in other words, that's c sub 1.
That becomes a 0 because there's t in there.
It's going to equal 0.
So, c sub 1 is 0.
So, x prime of t, if I do this, that's negative 4 times c sub 1 e to the power negative 4t to do this.
Now, this one is a product of two functions of t.
So, I've got to do the product rule.
So, that's going to be c sub 2 e to the power negative 4t and a negative 4 c sub 2t e to the power negative 4t.
So, that's going to be x prime of 0 and that's going to be, that's a 0 because c sub 1 is 0.
Now, this is going to be a c sub 2 because there's a 0 there, c sub 2.
And that's a 0 there as well because there's another t and then that's going to equal negative 3.
So, I'm going to have the fact that x of t is going to equal, and that term falls away, c sub 2 becomes negative 3t e to the power negative 4t.
As simple as that.
In the next video, we're going to look at a problem where we have complex numbers.
So, I'm going to look at a problem where we have complex numbers.
