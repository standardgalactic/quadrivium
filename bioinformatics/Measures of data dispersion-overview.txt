The text provides a tutorial on calculating and understanding standard deviation using spreadsheet software. It covers how to create columns of data, calculate the mean, convert data into a table format for easier manipulation, and select columns using shortcut keys (F2 on Windows or Ctrl-U on Mac). The tutorial explains two formulas: `=AVERAGE` for finding the mean and `=STDEV.P` or `=STDEV.S` to determine standard deviation for population or sample data respectively. It also illustrates how to adjust decimal places in calculations.

The text then describes how the calculated mean is represented by a red square, while individual data points are shown as blue diamonds on a chart. The standard deviation (14.8) indicates how much the data spread around the mean, with both positive and negative deviations considered. Finally, it explains how to find values one standard deviation above and below the mean using simple arithmetic operations (mean Â± standard deviation), exemplified with specific calculations leading to 12.3 and 41.9 as boundaries for one standard deviation from the mean.

The latter part of the text seems disjointed and may contain transcription errors or typos, but the initial sections provide a coherent explanation of calculating and interpreting standard deviations in data sets.
