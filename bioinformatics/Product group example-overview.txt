The text explains the concept of constructing a product group from two cyclic groups, both denoted as \( C_2 \), which consist of two elements each. The discussion begins by defining the elements and operations within a single cyclic group \( C_2 \), using symbols 1 and 2 (referred to as E for identity and τ for the non-identity element) under permutation operations.

The Cartesian product of these two groups is then formed, resulting in four combined elements: (E, E), (τ, E), (E, τ), and (τ, τ). The binary operation on this product group involves composing corresponding components from each pair according to the group operations defined within \( C_2 \).

A Cayley table for these combinations is constructed, demonstrating how each pair interacts under the composition rules. The results of these compositions confirm that all possible outcomes (E and τ) appear in a manner consistent with group properties.

The text concludes by symbolically renaming elements as A, B for one \( C_2 \), and D, E for another, to clarify operations on the product group formed from their union. This discussion highlights how simple combinations of cyclic groups can form new groups through Cartesian products and specific binary operations, illustrating fundamental concepts in abstract algebra.

The text discusses permutations on the union of two sets and identifies four specific permutations. It explains:

1. The identity permutation where each element maps to itself (A → A, B → B, C → C, D → D).
2. A permutation swapping C and D while leaving A and B unchanged.
3. A permutation that combines these swaps with another transformation involving A and B.

These permutations form a set isomorphic to the Klein 4 group, a well-known mathematical structure consisting of four elements. The text emphasizes how combining two cyclic groups (C2) results in these permutations, illustrating the simplicity of understanding product groups. It concludes by noting that this set of permutations corresponds directly to the Klein 4 group, highlighting its straightforward nature.

The text explains how to understand product groups using examples from cyclic groups. The focus is on the Cartesian product of two cyclic groups, \( C_2 \), each with elements labeled as 1 and 2 (or alternatively named E and τ for identity and another permutation). 

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Cyclic Group Elements**: 
   - Each group has two permutations: the identity permutation (E or 1) where each element maps to itself, and a swap permutation (τ or 2) where elements are swapped.

2. **Cartesian Product of Groups**:
   - The product \( C_2 \times C_2 \) is formed by pairing each element of the first group with each element of the second, resulting in four combinations: (E, E), (E, τ), (τ, E), and (τ, τ).

3. **Group Operation**:
   - The operation on these pairs follows from their respective group operations. For example, combining (E, τ) with (τ, E) involves composing the first components of each pair and the second components separately.

4. **Resulting Group Structure**:
   - When these combinations are composed according to group rules, it results in a group structure where every possible combination appears exactly once. This follows from Cayley's theorem, showing that the set forms another group under the defined operation.

5. **Symbolic Representation**:
   - Using alternative symbols (A, B for one \( C_2 \) and D, E for another), the union of these groups' elements shows four distinct elements: A, B, D, and E. The operations on these sets demonstrate how each pair operates under group composition.

Overall, the text is about illustrating how combining two simple cyclic groups leads to a new structure that can be understood through Cartesian products and group operation rules.

The text discusses permutations of the union of two sets and explores their properties. When combining elements from these sets, we obtain a set {A, B, C, D} and identify different permutations within it.

- The identity permutation is where each element maps to itself: A → A, B → B, C → C, D → D.
- Another permutation swaps C and D while leaving A and B unchanged: A → A, B → B, C → D, D → C.
- Applying the permutation τ twice results in another configuration: A → B, B → A, C → D, D → C.

These permutations form a group isomorphic to the Klein 4-group (V4), which consists of four elements. This group can be visualized as combining two cyclic groups C2 × C2, leading to four distinct permutations.

The text emphasizes that understanding these set permutations and their combination into groups is straightforward, with no inherent complexity in working with product groups like the Klein 4-group.
