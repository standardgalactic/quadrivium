The text discusses using the integral test for convergence and error estimation in a p-series, specifically \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3} \). It confirms that since \( p = 3 > 1 \), the series converges. To estimate the error when approximating the sum with a partial sum up to \( k = 100 \), the integral test is applied by integrating \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3} \) from 100 to infinity, yielding an estimated error of \( \frac{1}{200,000} \).

The speaker plans to show how to find \( n \) such that the approximation's error is within a desired threshold. This involves setting up an inequality where the integral from \( n \) to infinity of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3} \, dx \) must be less than or equal to a given error bound (e.g., \( \frac{1}{200,000} \)). The text emphasizes applying these methods in exams and real-life applications.

It also discusses determining an appropriate limit for the expression \(\frac{\star - 1}{2r^2}\) as \(r\) approaches infinity, ensuring it remains less than \(\frac{1}{200,000}\). Steps include:

1. Setting up the inequality: \(\frac{1}{2r^2} + \frac{1}{2n^2} \leq \frac{1}{200,000}\).
2. As \(r\) approaches infinity, \(\frac{1}{2r^2}\) becomes negligible, simplifying to \(\frac{1}{2n^2} \leq \frac{1}{200,000}\).
3. Solving for \(n\): This leads to \(n \geq 100\).

The conclusion is that a partial sum of at least 100 terms ensures the maximum error in approximation does not exceed the specified threshold, providing a practical method to determine needed accuracy.
