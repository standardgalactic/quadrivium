The text explains how to determine when a 2x2 matrix is singular by examining its determinant, calculated as \( AD - BC \). A matrix is singular if its determinant equals zero. The example given shows a matrix where one entire row consists solely of zeros, leading to both terms in the determinant calculation being zero (\(7 \times 0\) and \(9 \times 0\)), resulting in a determinant of zero. This confirms that having an entire row or column filled with zeros makes the matrix singular. The key takeaway is the rule that if a 2x2 matrix has a full row or column of zeros, it is singular due to its zero determinant.
