Good, so in this first section we're going to look at separable variables.
And what we want is an equation in this form.
We have a function in y on this side and we have the first derivative on this side.
dy dx equals some function of x only of x times some function of y only of y.
We can now get the y's and the x's, if you want to call it like that, on the same side.
If I divide both sides by h of y and I multiply both sides by dx, I've got the function in y with respect to y on one side and the function of x with respect to x on the other side.
If I now simply take the integral of both sides, or I can now simply take the integral of both sides.
Now this doesn't necessarily have to end up in the denominator.
This could have been in the denominator already on this side, which would make it in the numerator on this side.
But what we're trying to say is that we'll have a function just in y, integrate with respect to y,
and on the other side we'll have an equation just of x, and we can take the integral with respect to x,
and we can solve both of these and eventually solve for y to get to an answer.
So let's have a look at a few examples.
