So in this section we're going to talk about the nuclear binding energy.
We've already looked at the energy of the atom as far as the shells and subshells are concerned,
but now we're going to look at nuclear binding energy.
We're going to start off by looking at the mass defect of the nucleus
and how that explains the binding energy in the nucleus.
Because if I take a helium nucleus, just a nucleus,
two protons, two neutrons, it weighs 6.6447 times 10 to the power negative 27 kilograms.
If I take individually though, the nucleons are all bound in the nucleus,
if I take four individual nucleons, two protons and two neutrons though,
you'll see I get a different mass.
Why is there a mass, where did this mass disappear to?
Because unbound, they weigh so much, bound they weigh less.
And actually 5.03 times 10 to the power, they got 29 kilograms less.
Where did that go?
Well, that is what we refer to as the mass defect of the nucleus,
and that explains the nuclear binding energy.
Because you will remember from special relativity
that the rest energy equals mc squared.
So if there is a change in energy,
this rest energy, that is going to be a change in mass,
c squared is a constant.
And that mass defect explains this,
which we call the binding energy.
The binding energy.
So if I take this delta m and I multiply it by c squared,
I get a binding energy.
Let's just write it e, binding.
The binding energy of the nucleus.
That is where this mass defect,
this missing mass goes into energy
to bind those two protons and two neutrons.
and I get about 28.3 mega electron volts
for the binding energy of this helium nucleus.
So that drop in mass
of those four individual nuclear,
those four individual particles,
subatomic particles,
has been converted into energy
to bind the four of them together.
And that is the binding energy.
Now we looked at the binding energy now of helium,
the helium nucleus,
based on its mass in kilograms.
But it's traditional not to work in kilograms,
but in atomic mass units.
The atomic mass unit is denoted by a lowercase u.
And that atomic mass unit is defined
as exactly one twelfth the mass of carbon-12,
of full atom of carbon-12.
Now, if we then look at the mass of a proton,
1.6726 times 10 to the power negative 27 kilograms,
that equals 1.0073 units.
That makes one atomic mass unit,
so 1.6605 times 10 to the power negative 27 kilograms.
And if you take that,
and you multiply it by C squared,
you get that one atomic mass unit
has energy 931.5 mega electron volt.
So we saw, as I said in the previous example,
we just looked at the binding energy
energy is used in kilograms.
If I want to use atomic mass unit,
because in many expansive periodic tables
with a lot of data in them,
you'll find the atomic mass units in there.
But what that refers to is not only the nucleons,
but the tiny little mass of the electrons as well.
So, for instance, if we look at helium,
if we look at helium 2.4,
and with that I mean with the electrons.
Actually, I just want to write it this,
and we're all clear.
With electrons.
Okay, if you read that off from a table,
you'll get that that is,
I wrote it somewhere on my board,
4.0026, 4.0026 units,
atomic mass units.
That includes the electrons.
But we know they have very tiny little weight.
Now, what will happen is,
you will also get, for instance,
hydrogen 1,1,
again, with electrons,
that is written in the data tables.
Okay, and that is 1.0078 units.
1.0078 units.
Now, what happens with helium?
If I have helium 2.4,
and I add to that binding energy,
what am I going to get?
I'm going to get 2 times H11.
Remember, that's with electrons.
With electrons.
Plus 2 neutrons.
0, 1.
That's 0, 1.
And a neutron,
I want to write this as well here.
A neutron,
obviously there is no electrons there,
and there's certainly no protons,
so the atomic number is 0,
the atomic mass number is 1.
that has an atomic mass in units,
in units of 1.0087 units.
Okay, note,
note that.
So, this is just working in everyday life with physics,
that we do this in units,
but remember that these units include the electrons.
So, if I want just the binding energy now,
so please note,
the only difference is here,
that I'm going to work not from kilograms,
that we did before,
but I'm going to work with the data that's given in,
in,
in the periodic table,
or tables with,
with,
with lots of data.
By that I mean,
some periodic tables used at school,
they'll only have,
the name of the element,
for instance.
Okay,
if I'm going to work with that,
I just have to keep this in mind,
which separates it from working purely in the kilograms,
just with the,
with the nucleons itself.
So, that means,
I'll have to take,
two times,
this,
plus two times this,
and that gives you,
oh,
I've forgotten now.
Well,
I didn't do it.
Well,
if you just take,
these two,
you add them,
and you subtract,
this,
from the other side,
you are left with,
0.0304 units.
Atomic mass units,
as the binding energy.
So,
this is not an equal sign,
it just means,
I followed some process.
And we know that,
what the energy is of one unit,
is 931.5 mega electron volt,
so 0.0304 units,
so I'm going to multiply that by 931.5 mega electron volts,
over one unit.
That would be one over one,
so I'm not changing any,
because they are equivalent,
that is equivalent.
I get an energy of,
I get an energy of 28.32 mega electron volt,
and you'll see that that is the same,
we had 28.3 mega electron volt,
when we just purely worked with,
when we purely worked with,
the kilogram,
and if I work in atomic mass units,
I must keep this in mind,
I must keep,
this in mind.
It's just a little,
it's a little complex if you add it,
but there's nothing really difficult about this.
Let us look at this question then,
which is the most,
and which is the least stable nucleus.
I've got four ABCD,
four nuclei,
and they have a mass defect of,
positive 6,
times 10 to the power negative of 29,
positive 2,
times 10 to the power,
10 to the power negative of 9,
and zero and negative 2,
times 10 to the power negative of 29 kilogram.
So which one is the most stable?
Which one is the least stable?
Most stable means,
I need the most energy,
that I need to bring in,
to break it apart.
That means most stable.
In other words,
the amount of energy that I bring in,
that equals the binding energy.
If I then overcome that binding energy,
it will break apart.
So, remember,
E zero equals MC squared,
so the most binding energy,
the most binding energy,
means the most,
the largest C is a constant,
C squared is a constant,
so it will have to have more mass.
So the heavier delta M,
from E zero equals MC squared,
remember we're talking delta E,
equals delta M,
C squared,
so the one with the largest delta M,
will have the highest binding energy.
So clearly,
A will be the most stable.
D is totally unstable.
It doesn't require any kind of energy.
It is just going to break apart,
all on its own.
It's unstable,
so that will be the least stable,
of my four hypothetical nuclei.
And this one will be most stable.
More mass defect,
more stable.
Just a quick note,
in many textbooks you'll find this sort of graph,
we have the number of nucleons,
in other words,
the atomic mass number there,
and then we have binding energy,
divided by atomic mass number here.
And what you'll note is,
it gets more and more stable.
Helium is there,
then it drops to lithium,
and then it goes back up here,
sodium, etc.
And you'll find it here by about,
about 60 nucleons,
is the most stable,
and will have the most binding energy per nucleon.
will be up here,
and then it rapidly falls off again.
So you can get a question,
where you'll just have different elements,
and you'll sort of,
depending on how much information,
the graph contains,
you can fit them in,
and you can see,
the stability,
or which has more binding energy per nucleon,
versus some other element.
In this problem,
I want the mass defect,
in atomic mass units,
for this isotope of helium,
here is helium,
because it says that helium,
but there are two protons,
and only one neutron,
only one neutron.
And that is its atomic mass,
units 3.016030,
and then contrast that to tritium,
one proton,
two neutrons.
So that is an isotope of hydrogen,
and 3.016050 units.
Now remember,
what we said,
we're working with units,
so we have to see things slightly differently,
and as much as we're going to have,
3,2 helium,
plus some binding energy,
it's going to liberate,
all those parts for us,
and what are we going to have,
we're going to have two times,
hydrogen 1,1,
that is with its electrons,
and I'm only going to have,
one plus one neutron,
one zero N,
one neutron.
I'm only going to have that,
so if I'm looking for the binding energy,
the binding energy,
in atomic mass units,
that is going to equal,
two times this,
now I'm working with,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven significant digits,
so for hydrogen,
if you look that up,
it is,
1.007825,
plus one for a neutron,
which is 1.008665 units,
minus that of the helium,
that is units,
minus that of the helium,
which is 3.016030 units,
and that gives me an answer of,
8.285 times 10 to the power negative 3 units,
and if I do that for tritium,
that is going to equal 1 times this,
1.007825 units,
plus twice,
because I'm going to have two neutrons,
one hydrogen atom,
that is going to be,
2 times,
1.008665 units,
minus in the 3.016050 units,
and that gives me 9.105 times 10 to the power negative 3 units.
So,
that tells me,
if I multiply this by M squared,
if I multiply this by,
9.931.5 mega electron volts per unit,
it's going to take more energy,
to liberate all the constituent nucleon parts,
for tritium,
than it would take for helium 3.
10 to the power negative 4 units,
