To solve these problems involving sound waves in pipes, we use concepts related to standing waves and resonance in open and closed pipes.

### Problem 1: Closed Pipe (One End Closed)

- **Given:** 
  - Length of pipe \( L = 90 \) cm = 0.9 m
  - Fundamental frequency \( f_1 = 95 \) Hz

- **Concepts:**
  - For a pipe closed at one end and open at the other, the fundamental standing wave has a node (N) at the closed end and an antinode (A) at the open end.
  - The length of the pipe \( L \) is equal to \( \frac{1}{4} \lambda_1 \), where \( \lambda_1 \) is the wavelength of the fundamental frequency.

- **Calculation:**
  - Using \( L = \frac{1}{4} \lambda_1 \), we find:
    \[
    \lambda_1 = 4L = 4 \times 0.9 = 3.6 \text{ m}
    \]
  - The speed of sound \( v \) is given by the equation:
    \[
    v = f_1 \cdot \lambda_1
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    v = 95 \, \text{Hz} \times 3.6 \, \text{m} = 342 \, \text{m/s}
    \]

### Problem 2: Open Pipe (Both Ends Open)

- **Given:** 
  - Length of pipe \( L = 60 \) cm = 0.6 m
  - Fundamental frequency \( f_1 = 3 \) kHz = 3000 Hz

- **Concepts:**
  - For a pipe open at both ends, the fundamental standing wave has antinodes (A) at both ends.
  - The length of the pipe \( L \) is equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \lambda_1 \).

- **Calculation:**
  - Using \( L = \frac{1}{2} \lambda_1 \), we find:
    \[
    \lambda_1 = 2L = 2 \times 0.6 = 1.2 \text{ m}
    \]
  - The speed of sound \( v \) is given by the equation:
    \[
    v = f_1 \cdot \lambda_1
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    v = 3000 \, \text{Hz} \times 1.2 \, \text{m} = 3600 \, \text{m/s}
    \]

### Problem 3: Pipe with One End Open (Different Frequency)

- **Given:** 
  - Length of pipe \( L = 90 \) cm = 0.9 m
  - First overtone frequency \( f_2 = 285 \) Hz

- **Concepts:**
  - For a pipe closed at one end, the first overtone corresponds to having three-quarters of a wavelength within the pipe (\( \frac{3}{4} \lambda_2 \)).
  
- **Calculation:**
  - Using \( L = \frac{3}{4} \lambda_2 \), we find:
    \[
    \lambda_2 = \frac{4}{3}L = \frac{4}{3} \times 0.9 = 1.2 \text{ m}
    \]
  - The speed of sound \( v \) is given by the equation:
    \[
    v = f_2 \cdot \lambda_2
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    v = 285 \, \text{Hz} \times 1.2 \, \text{m} = 342 \, \text{m/s}
    \]

In each problem, understanding how standing waves form in pipes with different boundary conditions (open/closed ends) is crucial for determining the wavelength and speed of sound.
