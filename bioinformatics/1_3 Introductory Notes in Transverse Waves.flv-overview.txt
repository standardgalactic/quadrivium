To solve these problems involving sound waves in pipes, we use concepts related to standing waves and resonance in open and closed pipes.

### Problem 1: Closed Pipe (One End Closed)

- **Given:** 
  - Length of pipe \( L = 90 \) cm = 0.9 m
  - Fundamental frequency \( f_1 = 95 \) Hz

- **Concepts:**
  - For a pipe closed at one end and open at the other, the fundamental standing wave has a node (N) at the closed end and an antinode (A) at the open end.
  - The length of the pipe \( L \) is equal to \( \frac{1}{4} \lambda_1 \), where \( \lambda_1 \) is the wavelength of the fundamental frequency.

- **Calculation:**
  - Using \( L = \frac{1}{4} \lambda_1 \), we find:
    \[
    \lambda_1 = 4L = 4 \times 0.9 = 3.6 \text{ m}
    \]
  - The speed of sound \( v \) is given by the equation:
    \[
    v = f_1 \cdot \lambda_1
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    v = 95 \, \text{Hz} \times 3.6 \, \text{m} = 342 \, \text{m/s}
    \]

### Problem 2: Open Pipe (Both Ends Open)

- **Given:** 
  - Length of pipe \( L = 60 \) cm = 0.6 m
  - Fundamental frequency \( f_1 = 3 \) kHz = 3000 Hz

- **Concepts:**
  - For a pipe open at both ends, the fundamental standing wave has antinodes (A) at both ends.
  - The length of the pipe \( L \) is equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \lambda_1 \).

- **Calculation:**
  - Using \( L = \frac{1}{2} \lambda_1 \), we find:
    \[
    \lambda_1 = 2L = 2 \times 0.6 = 1.2 \text{ m}
    \]
  - The speed of sound \( v \) is given by the equation:
    \[
    v = f_1 \cdot \lambda_1
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    v = 3000 \, \text{Hz} \times 1.2 \, \text{m} = 3600 \, \text{m/s}
    \]

### Problem 3: Pipe with One End Open (Different Frequency)

- **Given:** 
  - Length of pipe \( L = 90 \) cm = 0.9 m
  - First overtone frequency \( f_2 = 285 \) Hz

- **Concepts:**
  - For a pipe closed at one end, the first overtone corresponds to having three-quarters of a wavelength within the pipe (\( \frac{3}{4} \lambda_2 \)).
  
- **Calculation:**
  - Using \( L = \frac{3}{4} \lambda_2 \), we find:
    \[
    \lambda_2 = \frac{4}{3}L = \frac{4}{3} \times 0.9 = 1.2 \text{ m}
    \]
  - The speed of sound \( v \) is given by the equation:
    \[
    v = f_2 \cdot \lambda_2
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    v = 285 \, \text{Hz} \times 1.2 \, \text{m} = 342 \, \text{m/s}
    \]

In each problem, understanding how standing waves form in pipes with different boundary conditions (open/closed ends) is crucial for determining the wavelength and speed of sound.

To solve problems involving waves in tubes and resonance, it's essential to understand how waves behave in different setups (open-open, closed-closed, or open-closed) and how they relate to wavelength (\(\lambda\)), frequency (f), and velocity (v).

### Key Concepts:

1. **Wavelength (\(\lambda\))**: The distance over which the wave's shape repeats.
2. **Frequency (f)**: How often the waves pass a point in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz).
3. **Velocity (v)**: The speed at which the wave propagates through the medium, calculated as \(v = f \cdot \lambda\).

### Tube Configurations:

1. **Open-Open**: Both ends are open, leading to antinodes (A) at both ends.
   - Fundamental mode: Length of tube \(L = \frac{\lambda}{2}\).
   
2. **Closed-Closed**: Both ends are closed, leading to nodes (N) at both ends.
   - Fundamental mode: Length of tube \(L = \frac{\lambda}{2}\).

3. **Open-Closed**: One end open (antinode), one end closed (node).
   - Fundamental mode: Length of tube \(L = \frac{\lambda}{4}\).

### Problem Solving:

#### Example 1: Open-Closed Tube

- **Given**: Length of the pipe \(L = 90\) cm (or 0.9 m), fundamental frequency \(f = 95\) Hz.
- **Find**: Velocity \(v\).

For an open-closed tube, the fundamental wavelength is:
\[ L = \frac{\lambda}{4} \]
Thus,
\[ \lambda = 4L = 4 \times 0.9 = 3.6 \text{ m} \]

Using the velocity formula:
\[ v = f \cdot \lambda = 95 \, \text{Hz} \times 3.6 \, \text{m} = 342 \, \text{m/s} \]

#### Example 2: Open-Open Tube (Hypothetical)

If you had an open-open tube with the same length and frequency:
\[ L = \frac{\lambda}{2} \]
Thus,
\[ \lambda = 2L = 2 \times 0.9 = 1.8 \text{ m} \]

Velocity would be:
\[ v = f \cdot \lambda = 95 \, \text{Hz} \times 1.8 \, \text{m} = 171 \, \text{m/s} \]

### General Approach:

1. **Identify the Tube Configuration**: Determine if it's open-open, closed-closed, or open-closed.
2. **Determine the Fundamental Wavelength**: Use the appropriate formula based on configuration.
3. **Calculate Velocity**: Use \(v = f \cdot \lambda\) once you have \(\lambda\).

Understanding these principles allows you to solve a wide range of wave-related problems in different contexts, such as sound waves in tubes or vibrations in strings.
