Now that is quite dark, but a lovely run nonetheless.
So as I said, it really is getting dark in the afternoon now,
and especially running this side of the mountain.
You have to take your sunglasses off most of the time just to see where you're going.
So I had time at least to do one educational video today.
We continue this look into the orbit stabilizer theorem in abstract algebra.
And today's video specifically is about the definition of the stabilizer of a group.
So I'll show you what that is, and also a couple of proofs just to show that the stabilizer just forms this subgroup of our original group.
Give that a look.
And then tomorrow is a public holiday.
Maybe I can do one recording, but the plans for tomorrow actually is to climb up Table Mountain.
So maybe I'll bring you along for that climb.
