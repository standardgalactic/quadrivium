Now we move on to exact differential equations. Now a differential expression
m of x and y so it's a multivariable function dx plus n in x and y so another multivariable
function dy is an exact differential exact differential in a region r of the xy plane
if it corresponds to some function also multivariable function defined in r such that
the partial derivative of m with respect to y equals the partial derivative of n with respect
to x with both m and n and their first partial derivatives being continuous in the rectangular
region r. Now unless you've had some multivariable calculus this might be a bit difficult to understand
and there's a whole explanation that has to go through there about this so I would refer
you to the series or lecture series on multivariable calculus or advanced calculus to understand
this. Please remember though just the following that we have a function f of x and we take
its partial derivative with respect to x we get m. There is m which is then a function
of x and y. And if we take a function f and x and y and we take its first partial derivative
with respect to y we get n. And we're saying if we take the differential of these such as
that I have m dx and m dy and these two are equal and these two and their first partial derivatives
are continuous in this rectangular region in the xy plane then this becomes an exact differential.
We'll do a first problem and if you don't know much about multivariable calculus the examples
will make clear what is happening here without you having a deep understanding of multivariable calculus
but it is preferable to know multivariable calculus so that this makes sense. Remember that this is the
differential we're talking about dz or the differential of x and y equals y dx plus x dy.
Just keep that in mind we're going to do a problem and we can check our answer
and we'll see that we can get back to this.
And we'll see that we can get back to this.
