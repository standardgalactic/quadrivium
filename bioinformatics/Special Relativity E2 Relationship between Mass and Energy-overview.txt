The text provides a detailed explanation of how energy loss through radiation affects the Sun's mass and explores concepts related to relativistic physics. Here’s a summary:

1. **Sun’s Energy Radiation**: The Sun emits electromagnetic radiation at a power of \(3.92 \times 10^{26}\) watts. Using Einstein’s equivalence principle (\(E = mc^2\)), this energy loss translates into a mass loss rate of approximately \(4.36 \times 10^9\) kilograms per second.

2. **Fractional Mass Loss Over Time**: Calculating the fractional loss over 75 years, it's found to be about \(5.18 \times 10^{-12}\), or roughly 5.18 nano percent of the Sun’s total mass—indicative of a negligible change in human terms.

3. **Energy-Mass Equivalence**: The discussion extends to various scenarios where energy changes result in mass changes, such as stretching a spring or heating water. For example, adding heat energy to one kilogram of water results in an incredibly small increase in mass (\(4.7 \times 10^{-14}\) kg).

4. **Relativistic Momentum and Energy**: The relationship between total relativistic energy and momentum is given by \(E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\). This formula shows how these quantities are interconnected.

5. **Speed Limit of Light**: As an object's velocity approaches the speed of light, its kinetic energy theoretically becomes infinite due to the denominator approaching zero in relativistic equations (\(v \rightarrow c\)). This implies that infinite work would be required for a mass to reach the speed of light, making it impossible.

Overall, these points illustrate fundamental principles of physics related to energy, mass, and motion at relativistic speeds.
