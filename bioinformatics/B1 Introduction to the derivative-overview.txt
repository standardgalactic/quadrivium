The text provides an overview of derivatives, focusing on the concept of the slope of a line as represented by \( y = mx + c \), where \( m \) is the slope calculated as the change in \( y \) over the change in \( x \). This slope represents how much \( y \) changes per unit change in \( x \). The text explains that as the slope increases, the line becomes steeper until it approaches a vertical position (where division by zero would occur, implying an infinite slope). Conversely, a horizontal line has a slope of zero.

The importance of understanding and calculating slopes is highlighted through their application in experiments. An example given involves plotting concentration versus velocity of growth from experimental data. By drawing a straight line that fits the data points, one can predict outcomes at untested concentrations based on the slope. This predictive power underscores the practical value of knowing how to calculate and interpret slopes in real-world scenarios.
