First off, we're going to look at the comparison test, and that says if 0 is less than or equal to and is less than or equal to, it should be B, okay, then if A can, if A can converges,
oh, my A's and B's are not good today. If B can converges, then A can must also converge. I mean, if that one converges, and this one's even smaller than that one, it must also converge.
Other way around, if A can diverges, if this one diverges, then the one that's larger than it, B can is larger than A can, then B can must also diverge, must also diverge.
And we're going to do an example in that you can't get mixed up with this. Write this down, write this down. It makes intuitive sense.
And then once you've written it down on paper, do your problem so that you don't get confused. We'll run through an example or two.
Okay, here's our first example. The comparison test is a reason for me saying it's important to learn the names of certain series and to know them by heart.
And what happens to them, whether they converge or by heart. Because this one looks very similar to our series K equals 1 to infinity of 1 over K to the power 3.
Especially if K becomes very large. If K becomes very large, I'm cubing it. If I just add K, then this has a, this contributes a lot less to this denominator than this.
So it looks very much like that. Now, first, if I have the two of them, K cubed plus 5K, and I have 1 over K cubed.
Which one is larger than the other one? Which one is the smallest?
Well, in this one, I'm adding a bit to the denominator. So it's got to be smaller than this.
It's got to be smaller than this. So this is my AK and this is my BK.
And that is, and that is there. Okay. Now, I know what happens to this. This is a P series.
My P is larger than 1. In other words, this series, this series, this one, converges.
This one's even smaller, so this one was also converge. That one was also converge. Comparison test, just because I knew this one by heart.
I didn't have to go through this whole thing, so it's important to memorize these.
Important to memorize these. Now, what if I have K equals 1 to infinity of 1 over K3 minus 5K?
Simple, simple, simple, simple. It's this one thing there. It's this one thing going on there.
Now, what is going on here? Which one is now larger than which one?
Well, in this one, I'm taking away from the denominator. That makes this one larger.
Larger or equal to that, you know, larger than that one.
In other words, this now becomes my, this is the larger one, this becomes my VK, this becomes my AK, so I have 0 is 1 over K3 is 1 over K3 minus 5K.
Unfortunately, unfortunately, the battery died. I'm not 100% sure where we let things off.
Let me go back, say, for instance, to this step. I have this now, which is a little bit different from this.
And I showed that now I'm increasing, I'm decreasing the denominator. That makes this one larger than that one.
This makes my BK and this now my AK.
So now I have, is less than AK, is less than BK.
Now I've shown that this one converges.
That this one is larger than that one.
So I can't say that this one converges.
I can't say that at all.
If this one converges, this one will converge.
If this one diverges, that one will diverge.
Okay, but this is the long way around.
So please, as I said, write this down in the beginning.
Write which one's converged and which one's diverged, depending on that.
And don't make a simple mistake here.
Just that one negative makes me unable to use the comparison test here.
Okay, let's look at this example.
5K, 5 to the power of K plus 1, 2 to the power of K minus 1.
This plus 1 negative 1 is not part of the experiment.
It's part of the numerator and denominator is this.
Now this looks, 5 to the power of K plus 1 over 2 to the power of K minus 1.
That looks a lot like 5 to the power of K over 2 to the power of K, which equals 5 over 2 to the power of K.
5 over 2 to the power of K.
Because as K gets a lot larger, this adding 1 and subtracting 1 is not going to make a hell of a difference.
Okay, so, I must have put equal signs there.
It's approximately equal to, so which one is bigger and which one is smaller?
Well, in this one, the difference between these two, in this one, I'm adding to the numerator and I'm decreasing the denominator.
That will make this one larger than that one.
So, this is my BK, the BK, and this is my 8K.
So, what I'm saying is 0 is less than 5 over 2K is less than 5K plus 1 and 2K minus 1.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying that.
Now, if you look at this one, if I do this sum from K equals 1 to infinity of 5 over 2K, what do I have here?
Once again, that's important to know the names.
This is the geometric series.
And it's 8R to the power of K.
My 8 is 1.
My R is 5 over 2.
And there's my K.
And what do we know?
Well, we remember the radius of convergence.
The radius of convergence, actually very little, has got to be less than 1.
And what is R?
It's 5 over 2.
It's 2 and a half.
So, it's not.
So, this series, as it stands, diverges.
So, if this one diverges, and this one is even larger than this one, then that one has to diverge as well.
Simple as that.
Now, here's a little bonus present.
It makes life so much easier for a great number of series.
We already looked at this one now.
And we showed that through the comparison test, it looks a bit like that.
But, unfortunately, this one converged.
And what we're trying to deal with, we didn't know.
Because that is the wrong way around for the comparison test.
Well, there's something called the limit comparison test, which solves this problem for us very neatly.
And that says, if a, k, and b, k are both larger than 0.
They've both got to be larger than 0.
And you can see both of them will be for any value of k.
In as much as k starts from 1 to infinity, going up by one integer, you know, one integer at a time.
If that is so, and the limit, if I take the limit, as k goes to infinity of ak over bk, equals some specific value.
And that value must be positive.
It must be larger than 0.
Then, either both converge or both diverge.
So, if we can show that this is true, then this one will also converge because that one converged.
Now, look, we're going to use this example.
Let me have a look.
Let me have a look.
Let me have a look.
Yes, let's use this example.
So, where do we stand?
Let's do this.
So, it's the limit.
This k goes to infinity of ak.
Which one was my ak?
That is 1 over k to the power of 3 divided by 1 over k3 minus 5k.
So, I've got to do that limit.
So, what I can do is bring this up into the numerator.
So, this is going to become k to the power of 3 minus 5k.
And that will disappear.
And then, that will make this 1 minus 5 over k squared.
So, I'm just dividing this numerator into that one and into that one.
So, I'm left to this limit.
So, I'm doing this quickly like this.
And if I take the limit as k goes to infinity, I get this limit to be exactly 1.
Because if I put infinity in there, 5 divided by infinity squared, that 0 is 1.
So, indeed, look at this.
There is a limit.
The limit is larger than 0.
Therefore, therefore, both of these will either converge or diverge.
And because this one converges, it means this one will converge too.
My comparison test problem solved through the limit comparison test.
The limit comparison test.
And that makes life a hell of a lot easy.
Fantastic.
