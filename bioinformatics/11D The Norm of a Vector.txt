Here's another example. We've got vector W in its component form, 3, 6, negative 4.
So that's in 3 space and I want this monster's value.
Of course, this is going to be a scalar value because I'm looking for magnitude as much as the norm is concerned.
This is going to turn out to be a scalar, a scalar times this, times this vector and then the norm of that.
So first of all, let's just get the norm of vector W.
The norm of vector W, I should do this, I should do that to have it proper.
So that is going to be the square root of 9 plus 6 times 6 is 36 plus 16.
I'm going to grab my calculator because it's late in the afternoon and I'm too lazy now.
9 plus 36 plus 16, that is going to give me the square root of 61.
The square root of 61.
So this is going to be 1 over the square root of 61 times this vector, 3, 6, negative 4.
So here I'm going to get 3 over the square root of 61.
6 over the square root of 61.
Negative 4 over the square root of 61.
Now, of all of that, all of that, I need the norm of this whole thing.
So that's going to be the square root of this square plus that square plus that square.
Okay, let's overlook the square root of this square is going to be 9 over 61.
3 squared is 9.
The square root of 61 is going to be 61.
Okay, plus 36, 36 over 61, plus 16 over 61.
And the square root of all of that is going to leave me, well, 1.
So the answer here is 1.
Now, I think let's make this, or let's do this example quickly.
I have vector u in 3 space, 3 components, vector v in component form as well.
I have the scalar.
K equals 3, and I am told that the scalar times this vector, times this scalar, times this vector,
and then gets this.
What is L?
It's quite simple to do.
In as much as, let's do ku first.
K times vector u.
This is going to be this scalar times this vector.
That's going to give us a 6.
That is going to give us an 18.
And that is going to give us a negative 21.
Let's do this one, lu.
Lv, sorry.
Lv, vector v.
That is just going to be L, negative 1l, I should say.
Let's do that.
Negative L, and again negative L, and then 8l, 8l.
Now, I've got to add these two.
So, what am I saying?
I'm saying 6 minus L equals 2.
That leaves me L equals 4.
L has got to be 4.
Let's check if that's true.
Let's take the next one.
Let's take the next one.
I've got 18 minus L, so that plus that is going to give me 14.
14, and indeed L equals 4.
Let's, when you waste time with the third one, you're going to see L equals 4.
So, you don't have to do all of those.
You just need one.
It's just going to be that plus that has got to give you that.
You just have to do all the way.
