The text outlines solving a first-order linear differential equation with a piecewise-defined function. The equation is \( y' + y = f(x) \), where:

- \( f(x) = 1 \) for \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \)
- \( f(x) = 0 \) for \( x > 1 \)

The initial condition is \( y(0) = 0 \).

### Solution Process

1. **Interval \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \):**

   - The equation becomes \( y' + y = 1 \).
   - Using the integrating factor \( e^x \), we transform it to:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}(e^x y) = e^x
     \]
   - Integrating gives:
     \[
     e^x y = e^x + C
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 1 + Ce^{-x}
     \]
   - Applying the initial condition \( y(0) = 0 \):
     \[
     0 = 1 + C \Rightarrow C = -1
     \]
   - Thus, the solution is:
     \[
     y = 1 - e^{-x} \quad \text{for } 0 \leq x \leq 1
     \]

2. **Interval \( x > 1 \):**

   - The equation becomes \( y' + y = 0 \).
   - Using the integrating factor \( e^x \):
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}(e^x y) = 0
     \]
   - Integrating gives:
     \[
     e^x y = C_2
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = C_2 e^{-x}
     \]

3. **Continuity at \( x = 1 \):**

   - Ensure continuity by matching solutions at \( x = 1 \).
   - From \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), \( y(1) = 1 - e^{-1} \).
   - For \( x > 1 \), \( y(1) = C_2 e^{-1} \).
   - Equating for continuity:
     \[
     C_2 e^{-1} = 1 - e^{-1}
     \]
   - Solving for \( C_2 \):
     \[
     C_2 = (1 - e^{-1})e
     \]

### Final Solution

- For \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \):
  \[
  y = 1 - e^{-x}
  \]

- For \( x > 1 \):
  \[
  y = (e - 1)e^{-x}
  \]

The solution is continuous at \( x = 1 \). The text emphasizes the importance of selecting a particular solution that ensures continuity across the piecewise-defined intervals.
