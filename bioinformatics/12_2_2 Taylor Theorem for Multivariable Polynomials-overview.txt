The text provides an overview of Taylor's theorem for multivariable functions, emphasizing its complexity compared to the single-variable version. Here are the key points:

1. **Conditions for Application**:
   - The function \( f \) must be defined on an open convex set and have continuous partial derivatives up to order \( r+1 \).
   - A point \( p \) within this domain is required, ensuring all line segments between any two points in the set lie entirely within it.

2. **Convex Set**:
   - Describes a convex set as one where every line segment connecting two points remains inside the set.
   - Illustrates with examples ranging from 2D to higher dimensions and explains that if any part of such a segment falls outside, the set is not convex.

3. **Taylor's Theorem for Multivariable Functions**:
   - States \( f(\mathbf{x}) \) can be expressed as a Taylor polynomial plus an error term.
   - Emphasizes the need to consider three main conditions: domain, continuity of partial derivatives, and point inclusion within the set.

4. **Error Term**:
   - Discusses potential sources of errors in calculations, often due to neglecting \( r+1 \) or choosing a wrong point \( c \).
   - Highlights that \( c \) is an unknown point on the line segment between \( \mathbf{x} \) and \( \mathbf{p} \).

5. **Practical Example**:
   - Provides an example involving the function \( f(\mathbf{x}) = e^{x/n}y \).
   - Outlines steps to compute a second-order Taylor polynomial expansion, noting the importance of correctly applying derivative operations.

6. **Calculation Details**:
   - Walks through detailed calculations, including dot products and powers.
   - Stresses maintaining accuracy in each step and using approximations cautiously due to unknown \( c \).

The text serves as both an instructional guide on the theoretical aspects of Taylor's theorem for multivariable functions and a practical walkthrough of applying it.

The text describes a series of mathematical operations involving algebraic manipulation, differentiation, and substitution. Here's a summary:

1. **Algebraic Operations**: The process begins with division in normal algebra leading to expressions like \(6\), \(x^3 d_1^3\), and terms involving powers of \(x\) and \(y\).

2. **Combining Like Terms**: Common factors such as \(2x^2(y-1)\) are identified, allowing simplification by combining similar terms into expressions like \(3x^2(y-1)d_1^2d_2\).

3. **Partial Derivatives**: The text discusses setting partial derivatives equal and calculating higher-order mixed partial derivatives with respect to variables \(x\) and \(y\), focusing on expressions involving exponential and logarithmic functions.

4. **Differentiation Process**:
   - First, the third derivative of a function \(f\) with respect to \(x\) is considered.
   - Subsequent steps involve taking second derivatives of mixed terms, using properties like \(\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x\).
   - The differentiation continues iteratively for terms involving \(y^{-1}\), resulting in expressions like \(-e^x/y^2\) and eventually \(2e^x/y^3\).

5. **Substitution**: After computing the derivatives, specific values (denoted as \(a\) and \(b\)) are substituted into the derived expressions.

6. **Final Expression**: The final step involves multiplying by a constant factor (6) to yield the complete expression for the evaluated function at point \(c\), resulting in terms like \(\frac{1}{2}x^3 e^{a \ln b}\).

Overall, the text outlines a detailed process of algebraic manipulation and differentiation leading to an evaluation of a complex mathematical expression.

The text describes a mathematical process involving equations and error analysis using Taylor's theorem. It outlines an equation with terms involving \( y \), \( x \), and exponential functions, specifically focusing on the second-order error component.

Key points include:
- An initial expression: \( y = b + 3x(y - 1)^2 \).
- A negative term involving an exponential function: \(-e^{(a/b)^2}\), equated to \(2a6\).
- Further expressions involve cubing and exponential terms.
- The goal is to substitute values for \( a \) and \( b \) at a point \( p \) to determine error bounds, acknowledging that exact values are unknown.
- The text references using Taylor's theorem to express the function as a second-order polynomial plus an error term \( r(x) \).

Overall, it discusses setting up and analyzing equations with errors using Taylor series expansion.

The text provides an explanation of Taylor's theorem for multivariable functions, highlighting its complexity compared to the single-variable version. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Taylor's Theorem for Multivariable Functions**:
   - Requires specific conditions: 
     - The function \( f \) must be defined on an open convex set.
     - All partial derivatives up to order \( r+1 \) must be continuous.
     - A point \( p \) must lie within the domain.

2. **Convex Set Definition**:

2. **Combining Terms**: The text identifies common factors, such as \(2x^2 (y-1)\) and \(d_1^2 d_2^2\), allowing terms to be combined into expressions like \(3x^2(y-1)d_1^2 d_2\) and \(3xy(y-1)^2 d_1 d_2^2\).

3. **Partial Derivatives**: The focus shifts to finding partial derivatives with respect to variables \(x\) and \(y\). This involves differentiating expressions like \(e^x \log y\) multiple times.

4. **Derivative Calculations**:
   - First, the third derivative with respect to \(x\) is taken, resulting in terms involving \(x^3 e^x\).
   - Then, mixed partial derivatives are calculated, leading to expressions like \(-\frac{e^x}{y^2}\) and ultimately \(\frac{2e^x}{y^3}\).

5. **Substitution**: Finally, specific values for \(x\) and \(y\) (denoted as \(a\) and \(b\)) are substituted into the expressions to evaluate them at a point \(c\).
