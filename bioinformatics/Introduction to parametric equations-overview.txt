To parametrize the segment of the curve \( y = x^2 \) between the points \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 9)\), you can define a parameter \( t \) that varies from 0 to 1. This will allow the parameterization to smoothly transition between these two specific points.

### Parametrization Steps:

1. **Define \( x(t) \):** 
   - Since \( x \) changes linearly from 1 to 3, you can express it as:
     \[
     x(t) = 1 + (3 - 1)t = 1 + 2t
     \]
   - Here, when \( t = 0 \), \( x(0) = 1 \), and when \( t = 1 \), \( x(1) = 3 \).

2. **Define \( y(t) \):**
   - Since \( y = x^2 \), substitute the expression for \( x(t) \):
     \[
     y(t) = (x(t))^2 = (1 + 2t)^2
     \]
   - Expanding this gives:
     \[
     y(t) = 1 + 4t + 4t^2
     \]

3. **Parametric Equations:**
   - The parametric equations for the curve segment are:
     \[
     x(t) = 1 + 2t
     \]
     \[
     y(t) = (1 + 2t)^2 = 1 + 4t + 4t^2
     \]

4. **Parameter Range:**
   - The parameter \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1:
     \[
     0 \leq t \leq 1
     \]

This parametrization ensures that as \( t \) varies from 0 to 1, the point \((x(t), y(t))\) moves along the curve \( y = x^2 \) from \((1, 1)\) to \((3, 9)\).

To find the parametric equations for the line segment from point \( (4, -2) \) to point \( (2, -1) \), we can use a parameter \( t \) that varies from 0 to 1.

The general form of the parametric equations for a line segment between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:

\[
x(t) = x_1 + (x_2 - x_1)t
\]
\[
y(t) = y_1 + (y_2 - y_1)t
\]

Substituting the given points \( (4, -2) \) and \( (2, -1) \):

- For \( x(t) \):
  \[
  x(t) = 4 + (2 - 4)t = 4 - 2t
  \]

- For \( y(t) \):
  \[
  y(t) = -2 + (-1 + 2)t = -2 + t
  \]

Thus, the parametric equations for the line segment are:

\[
x(t) = 4 - 2t
\]
\[
y(t) = -2 + t
\]

where \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1. At \( t = 0 \), the point is \( (4, -2) \), and at \( t = 1 \), the point is \( (2, -1) \).

Let's break down the solution for finding parametric equations for conic sections given specific conditions.

### Intersection of Lines

**Problem Statement:**
You have two lines:
1. \( x = 2t + 1 \)
2. \( y = -3t + 4 \)

These are already in parametric form, where \( t \) is the parameter. The intersection or solution set is simply represented by these equations together:
- \( x(t) = 2t + 1 \)
- \( y(t) = -3t + 4 \)

### Parametric Equations for an Ellipse

**Problem Statement:**
Find parametric equations for the ellipse given by:

\[
\frac{x^2}{5^2} + \frac{y^2}{12^2} = 1
\]

**Solution:**

Using trigonometric identities, we know:
- \( \sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) = 1 \)

We can set:
- \( x/5 = \sin(t) \)
- \( y/12 = \cos(t) \)

Thus, the parametric equations are:
- \( x(t) = 5\sin(t) \)
- \( y(t) = 12\cos(t) \)

The parameter \( t \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \) for a complete traversal of the ellipse.

### Parametric Equations for a Hyperbola

**Problem Statement:**
Find parametric equations for the hyperbola given by:

\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

**Solution:**

Using trigonometric identities, we know:
- \( \sec^2(t) - \tan^2(t) = 1 \)

We can set:
- \( x/a = \sec(t) \)
- \( y/b = \tan(t) \)

Thus, the parametric equations are:
- \( x(t) = a\sec(t) \)
- \( y(t) = b\tan(t) \)

The parameter \( t \) typically ranges over intervals that avoid undefined values for secant and tangent, such as \( t \neq \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \), where \( k \) is an integer.

### Summary

- **Lines**: Given directly in parametric form.
- **Ellipse**: Use sine and cosine identities to derive \( x(t) = 5\sin(t) \) and \( y(t) = 12\cos(t) \).
- **Hyperbola**: Use secant and tangent identities to derive \( x(t) = a\sec(t) \) and \( y(t) = b\tan(t) \).

These methods leverage trigonometric identities to convert standard conic section equations into parametric form, simplifying analysis and graphing.

It seems like you're discussing how to work with parametric equations and visualizing them using the Wolfram Language (now known as the Wolfram Language for Mathematica). Let’s break down some key points from your text and discuss how you can leverage this tool effectively.

### Key Concepts

1. **Parametric Equations**:
   - These are equations where the coordinates of the points on a curve are expressed as functions of one or more parameters.
   - For example, \( x(t) = 2 \sin(t) \) and \( y(t) = 2 \cos(t) + 2 \).

2. **Using Wolfram Language**:
   - The Wolfram Language is powerful for symbolic computation and visualization.
   - You can easily plot parametric curves by using functions like `ParametricPlot`.

Its symbolic computation capability makes it particularly powerful in mathematics and science applications. Whether you're plotting functions, solving equations, or creating dynamic interfaces, Mathematica provides the tools needed to explore and visualize data effectively.

The discussion you provided outlines the exploration of various parametric equations and their geometric interpretations using Wolfram Mathematica or similar software tools like Desmos or GeoGebra. Here’s a brief breakdown of the concepts discussed, which may help in understanding parametric equations better:

1. **Parametric Equations**:
   - Parametric equations define a group of quantities as functions of one or more independent variables called parameters.
   - For example, \( x(t) = 3\cos(2t) + \sin(5t) \) and \( y(t) = 3\sin(2t) + \cos(5t) \), where \( t \) is the parameter.

2. **Geometric Interpretations**:
   - Parametric equations can describe complex shapes, such as stars or cycloids.
   - For instance, the equation involving cosines and sines creates a five-pointed star shape.

3. **Using Software Tools**:
   - Mathematica, Desmos, and GeoGebra are powerful tools for visualizing parametric equations.
   - They allow you to manipulate parameters interactively and observe changes in real-time.

4. **Hyperbolic Functions**:
   - The hyperbolic cosine and sine functions describe a hyperbola, similar to how trigonometric functions describe circles.
   - Example: \( x(t) = \cosh(t) \), \( y(t) = \sinh(t) \).

5. **Cycloids**:
   - A cycloid is the curve traced by a point on the rim of a circular wheel as it rolls along a straight line.
   - Parametric form: \( x(t) = at - a\sin(t) \), \( y(t) = a - a\cos(t) \).

6. **Derivatives and Slopes**:
   - The discussion mentions finding derivatives to determine the slope of the curve at specific points, such as where it meets the x-axis.
   - For curves with cusps (sharp points), traditional derivatives may not exist or need special consideration.

7. **Interactive Exploration**:
   - Using sliders in software tools allows exploration of how changing parameters affect the shape and properties of the curve.

This overview should help you understand the key concepts involved in working with parametric equations and their applications in creating various geometric shapes. If you have specific questions about any part, feel free to ask!

The text highlights the unique feature of a cycloid meeting the x-axis perpendicularly with an infinite slope. It encourages learning how to work with such curves by hand and introduces using the Wolfram Language as an easier alternative. The speaker plans to demonstrate its simplicity during their course, suggesting that students explore parametric equations through resources on wolframcloud.com. They recommend opening a free account there to experiment with these tools. Additionally, they offer links in the description for further courses, including an introductory course on Mathematica or the Wolfram Language available on Udemy.

To parametrize the segment of the curve \( y = x^2 \) between the points \( (1, 1) \) and \( (3, 9) \), you can express both \( x \) and \( y \) as functions of a parameter \( t \). Here's a straightforward approach:

1. **Choose a Linear Parametrization for \( x \):**

   Since you want the curve to move from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), a natural choice is:
   \[
   x(t) = 1 + 2t
   \]
   where \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1. This linear parametrization ensures that when \( t = 0 \), \( x = 1 \), and when \( t = 1 \), \( x = 3 \).

2. **Express \( y \) in Terms of \( t \):**

   Since \( y = x^2 \), substitute the expression for \( x(t) \):
   \[
   y(t) = (x(t))^2 = (1 + 2t)^2
   \]
   Simplifying, you get:
   \[
   y(t) = 1 + 4t + 4t^2
   \]

3. **Combine to Form the Parametric Equations:**

   The parametric equations for the segment of the curve are:
   \[
   x(t) = 1 + 2t, \quad y(t) = 1 + 4t + 4t^2
   \]
   with \( t \) ranging from 0 to 1.

These equations describe the path along the parabola from the point \( (1, 1) \) to the point \( (3, 9) \).

To find the parametric equations for the line segment from point \( (4, -2) \) to point \( (2, -1) \), we will use the general form of a parametric equation for a line:

\[
x = a + bt
\]
\[
y = c + dt
\]

where \( t \) ranges over an interval. We'll determine appropriate values for \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \).

### Step 1: Determine Constants

1. **At \( t = 0 \)**, we start at the point \( (4, -2) \):
   - \( x = a + b(0) = a = 4 \)
   - \( y = c + d(0) = c = -2 \)

2. **At \( t = 1 \)**, we end at the point \( (2, -1) \):
   - \( x = a + b(1) = 4 + b = 2 \)
     - Solving for \( b \): 
       \[
       4 + b = 2 \implies b = 2 - 4 = -2
       \]
   - \( y = c + d(1) = -2 + d = -1 \)
     - Solving for \( d \):
       \[
       -2 + d = -1 \implies d = -1 + 2 = 1
       \]

### Step 2: Write the Parametric Equations

With \( a = 4 \), \( b = -2 \), \( c = -2 \), and \( d = 1 \), the parametric equations for the line segment are:

\[
x = 4 - 2t
\]
\[
y = -2 + t
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Interval for \( t \)

Since we want the parameter \( t \) to move from point \( (4, -2) \) to point \( (2, -1) \), we set:
- \( t = 0 \) at \( (4, -2) \)
- \( t = 1 \) at \( (2, -1) \)

Thus, the interval for \( t \) is \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \).

### Final Parametric Equations

The parametric equations for the line segment from \( (4, -2) \) to \( (2, -1) \) are:

\[
x = 4 - 2t
\]
\[
y = -2 + t
\]

where \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \).

To solve these problems involving parametric equations for conic sections like ellipses and hyperbolas using trigonometric identities, let's break down each scenario:

### Ellipse

Given the standard form of an ellipse:
\[ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \]

**Steps to derive parametric equations:**

1. **Identify Trigonometric Identity**: Use the identity \(\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) = 1\).

2. **Express \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of trigonometric functions**:
   - Set \(\frac{x}{a} = \sin(t)\), which implies \(x = a \sin(t)\).
   - Set \(\frac{y}{b} = \cos(t)\), which implies \(y = b \cos(t)\).

3. **Parametric Equations**: 
   - \(x = a \sin(t)\)
   - \(y = b \cos(t)\)

4. **Domain**: Typically, \(t\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) for a complete traversal of the ellipse.

### Hyperbola

Given the standard form of a hyperbola:
\[ \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \]

**Steps to derive parametric equations:**

1. **Identify Trigonometric Identity**: Use the identity \(\sec^2(t) - \tan^2(t) = 1\).

2. **Express \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of trigonometric functions**:
   - Set \(\frac{x}{a} = \sec(t)\), which implies \(x = a \sec(t)\).
   - Set \(\frac{y}{b} = \tan(t)\), which implies \(y = b \tan(t)\).

3. **Parametric Equations**: 
   - \(x = a \sec(t)\)
   - \(y = b \tan(t)\)

4. **Domain**: Typically, \(t\) is restricted to intervals where \(\sec(t)\) and \(\tan(t)\) are defined, such as \(t \in (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})\) for one branch of the hyperbola.

### Summary

- For an **ellipse**, use sine and cosine functions with the identity \(\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) = 1\).
- For a **hyperbola**, use secant and tangent functions with the identity \(\sec^2(t) - \tan^2(t) = 1\).

These identities help transform the standard forms into parametric equations, making it easier to work with these conic sections in various applications.

It looks like you're working on understanding parametric equations and their graphical representations using the Wolfram Language (now part of Mathematica). Let's break down the key points from your text and provide some guidance on how to proceed with creating curves.

### Understanding Parametric Equations

1. **Parametric Form**: 
   - A parametric equation expresses a set of quantities as explicit functions of a number of independent variables, known as parameters.

2. **Trigonometric Identities**:
   - You mentioned using identities like \( \sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) = 1 \). This is often used to describe circles or ellipses.
   - For example, \( x = a \sin(t) \) and \( y = b \cos(t) \) can describe an ellipse.

3. **Completing the Square**:
   - This technique is useful for transforming equations into forms that are easier to graph, such as converting general conic sections into standard form.
