and now we come to something so interesting the indeterminate form now I warn you you must have
done a bit of calculus before just taking first derivatives and sometimes repeating that first
derivative in order to do these but usually it's not too difficult if you've had some high school
calculus you can do simple first derivatives you should be okay now look at these two expressions
t plus one over e to the power t and t minus two over t cubed minus eight and if I were just to do
direct substitution there on the left hand side I'm going to get infinity over infinity on the right
hand side I'm going to get zero over zero these are not values these are not numbers you can't leave
it as such now we've seen this before what we did is we divided the numerator and denominator by the
largest powered variable in the denominator but if you look on the left hand side we have an
exponential there it's not a normal polynomial in other words we we're hitting a bit of difficulty
for now all I want you to do is imprint those two things in your mind infinity over infinity that can
be positive or negative and zero over zero those are solutions that we call indeterminate they are in
in this these limits are in indeterminate form and there's something we can do about that
and this is what we do l'Hopital's rule and that says if you have a fraction one polynomial divided by
the other now f of t divided by g of t with g of t being defined and both of them in the limit is zero or
infinity remember infinity positive or negative what you do according to this rule is to take the first
derivative separately of the f of t separately of the g of t we're not going to make use of the
quotient rule here this is not the first derivative of the whole quotient f of t divided by g of t
this is something I would almost want to say unmathematical we're just going to take very separately the first
derivative of the numerator and the first derivative of the denominator that is quite different from
the quotient rule do not get the two things confused okay now l'Hopital's rule actually goes
much further where you actually have to do Taylor polynomial Taylor expansions etc etc but we're not
going to deal with that kind of thing here in limits so let's have this the limit is t goes to infinity of
t divided by t plus 2 squared if I were just to do the substitution I'm going to end up with
infinity of infinity that's indeterminate form so what do I do what is the first derivative of the
variable t well that's just one the first derivative of t plus 2 or squared is two times t plus 2 I show
that on the right hand side and now if I do that limit I get one over infinity we've seen that before
so many times that equals zero exactly as the graph described before so we do have a solution for
this limit let's look at t divided by e to the power t you can see the graph there it's going to go to
zero it's infinity of infinity indeterminate form we take the first derivative of the numerator which
is one we take the first derivative of the denominator e to the power t its first derivative is e to the
power t again I end up with one over infinity which is zero beautiful what about t squared what I'm
going to show you here is sometimes you have to apply l'Hopital's rule twice because the first derivative
of t squared is 2t again over e to the power t if I do the limit now as t approaches infinity I'm stuck
with infinity over infinity again again in determinate form what do I do I apply l'Hopital's rule again
and now I end up with 2 over e to the power t again the limit of that is zero and I show you there
I take the constant 2 outside of the limit doesn't matter it ends up being zero
so those are all easy to do but these are the ones that you're going to be faced with
now this is not truly indeterminate form if you get a solution of one of these five you have to do
some jumping around you're going to have to do a lot of algebra I warn you some of these can be very
tricky very difficult but you're going to have to do something to your expression
to change it so that you get either infinity over infinity or zero over zero those are the
two indeterminate forms these are not you cannot apply l'Hopital's rule when you get this kind of
solution and what you're going to get is one of these five infinity minus infinity zero times infinity
zero to the power zero one to the power infinity infinity to the power zero okay those if you get
those kind of results you're in trouble and you'll have to get out of it let's have a look at the first
one infinity minus infinity there we have our expression one over t squared minus one over t to
the power four you put in the value as t approaches zero you're going to get infinity minus infinity there
now you're in trouble and you have to get out of trouble sometimes it's going to be easy to get out
of trouble sometimes it's going to be very difficult and and I'll show you how difficult it can get
now one of the first things you can do to get out of trouble is to use common sense first of all if
you were to do a bit of simple algebra just get a common denominator there this is what you have
now think about it without applying anything just think about things a little bit
what is going to happen what is going to happen to the numerator just imagine in your mind what is
going to happen t squared minus one well the t squared is going to go to zero so your numerator is
going to tend to be negative one as t approaches zero your denominator is going to become a tiny tiny
tiny value is going to approach zero and any constant divided by a minutely small number is infinity
but we've got the negative one in the numerator so this really is going to be negative infinity okay we
could use common sense to work this one out let's look at something way more difficult and you see
they have put down the word difficult even again with infinity of infinity we have one over the natural
log of t plus one minus one over t i plug zero into both of them i'm actually going to get infinity
minus infinity that's not going to work for me i cannot apply l'opital's rule because infinity minus
infinity is not true indeterminate form it's a special kind of indeterminate form let's do some basic
algebra we're getting a common denominator that's becoming a theme isn't it so there we are in line two
i've got my common denominator and i see if i now would plug in t approaching zero i get zero over zero
lo and behold i can now use l'opital's rule i can take the first derivative of the numerator i can take
the first derivative of the denominator pause the video do it on your own see if you get the same thing
and now i'm left with that what do i get the zero over zero still not helping me out much
now one way we saw was to reapply l'opital's rule in this instance not going to work for you you can
go down that avenue you're going to find you're going to find a dead end you have to look for
something else and look what we did at the top on the right hand side there something very surprising
very surprising we multiplied both the numerator and denominator by t plus one over t plus one this is
not something that can be taught this is not a rule this is not something you can apply in every
instance it is something that you will have to look at you will have to look at it and decide what to
do what will make that expression or what will change that expression to make it into something
that is again in determinate form that will help you out of your problem you have to explore all sorts
of avenues many of them will be dead ends one of them won't be a dead end in this instance this
multiplying by t plus one over t plus one is not a dead end so we end up with the expression that you
see there if we take the limitless temperature zero of that we are going to get zero zero over zero again
two in determinate form now we can apply l'opital's rule and now it's going to be very simple we're going
to get one over one plus natural log of t plus one plus one that's one over two a half end of problem
now you're not just going to look at this problem and solve it within a couple of seconds you are
going to go down many many dead ends stick to it though somewhere along the line something's going
to help so little rules of thumb start by getting a common denominator get it in indeterminate form
apply l'opital's rule even apply the second time if you'd run into a dead end or it makes things even
worse applying l'opital's rule back up take another fork in the road try something else and the
usual other thing to try is to multiply your expression by essentially by one because t plus
one over t plus one is just one so you're multiplying by one you're not changing anything
that usually gets you out of jail in some form or fashion let's look at this infinity times zero
this is an easy one we see that the natural log of t times one over t if i were to just plug in
infinity i'm going to get infinity times zero that's not true in determinate form but i can just do a
simple rewrite natural log of t times one over t is actually just the natural log of t over t
if i were to plug in infinity now i'm getting infinity over infinity
that i can apply l'opital's rule i can get the first derivative of the natural log of t and the
first derivative of t so i'll just end up with one over t and so that is
one over t and the limit as that approaches infinity of t that's just the zero so that's an easy one
always just look out for rewriting things in a in a slightly different way so another little tool in
your basket there okay now things are going to get very serious this is this is only for someone
who needs to do hardcore difficult problems look at this and that's basically the last of the tools
that i'm going to put in your pocket the limit as t approaches one from the positive side of t to the
power one over t minus one i'm telling you now very difficult there's no way you're getting out of jail
by rearranging that in any form by multiplying it out by anything any algebraic way of tackling that
problem is basically not going to work for you now what do we do we're going to introduce a new
variable so that's a whole new method you see then read y equals i'm going to take my expression t to
the power one over t minus one and i'm going to equate that to a new variable i'm going to call that variable
y what i'll now do is take the natural log of both sides so the natural log of y
is going to be the natural log of t to the power one over t minus one by the laws of logarithms i can
bring that power in front of the natural log logarithm sign there so i'm going to get one over t minus
one times the natural log of t now let's take the limit not the limit of y which is my original
expression but the net the limit of the natural log of y if i were to do that that'll be the limit
as t approaches one from the positive side of one over t minus one times the natural log of t now we
say t from the positive side because remember the natural logarithm is only defined for values larger
than zero okay so uh uh we we're viewing things from the positive side here so if i were to do that if i
were to just plug in if i were just to simplify things i put natural log of t over t minus one
and i plug in t approaching one i'm going to get zero over zero that's indeterminate form and i can
now very simply take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator and that leaves me with one over
t if i now were to plug in t approaching one i'm going to get one over one which is one so the limit as
t approaches one from the positive side of the natural log of y equals one but i was never
interested in the limit of the natural log of y i was interested in the limit just of y
y being my expression t to the power one over t minus one i do remember something from mathematics
though any variable like y i can rewrite as e to the power natural log of y those two things are exactly
the same so if i were to take the natural the limit as t approaches one of y that would be the same as
t approaches one of e to the power natural log of y and i remember my limit laws now because if i take
the limit of a constant to the power some variable it would be the same as just taking that constant
and then taking the limit of the power you'll see there it now becomes e to the power the limit as
t approaches one from the positive side of the natural log of y lo and behold look a few steps back we've
just seen that the solution to that is one so i am left with e to the power one which is e
so a lot to take in in a couple of seconds watch this video again and again this is absolutely
beautiful there's a beautiful there's beautiful mathematics happening on this slide it's actually
such a cunning way of getting out of out of trouble once you've understood this once you've mastered the use
of this it is a beauty let's have a look at another example where i'm going to do this
now now we're going to get zero to the power zero was one of the five ones which are not true in
determinate form and we cannot apply l'hôpital's rule so it's the sine of t all of it to the power t
if i were to plug in t approaching zero from the positive side i'm going to get zero to the power zero
it's not true in determinate form i have to do something else you can't do anything algebraically
there what you will have to do is introduce a new variable the last little trick in your pocket
y equals the sine of t to the power t i take the natural log of both sides which allows me to get
rid of the power because i can bring the power in front of the natural log sign that's one of the
laws of logarithms i now take the limit as t approaches zero from the positive side of the natural log of
y not y the natural log of y which is the limit as t approaches zero from the positive side of t
times the natural log of the sine of t now look these two brown circles it's just an algebraic rewrite
i'm taking that t and i'm putting it in the denominator but to do that it's one over t
if i do that and i plug in t approaching zero from the positive side i'm going to get negative
infinity and the numerator infinity in the denominator i said you can get plus or minus
infinity of infinity that's still lopital's rule look though just at the graph at the bottom there
as t approaches zero from the left hand from the right hand side we see the graph does approach one
so we better get to a solution of one and of course with this kind of slide you can see the bottom
right hand side the solution is actually one we do get to it now top right we are in indeterminate
form we can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator so these are
slightly more difficult derivatives you'll have to know something about those first derivatives and
we end up with that now what now though i ask you with tears in my eyes what now
and i show you there and what to do you're going to go through so many blind alleys dead ends until
you figure this one out if i were to multiply both the numerator and denominator by t squared times the
sine of t you can well imagine this is not a hard and fast rule this is not something you can be taught
this is something that you do you stay at that expression cosine of t over the sine of t over negative
one over one over t squared until you figure out something that will lead you down to the gates
that open to the solution as opposed to a dead end so if i were to multiply both my numerator and
denominator by t squared times the sine of t i'm going to end up with negative t squared cosine of t over
the sine of t if i take the limit of that as t approaches zero from the positive side i'm going to get
a proper zero over zero that's indeterminate form i can apply l'hospital's rule once i do that the
first derivative of the numerator ends up being negative two times t times the cosine of t plus t
squared times the sine of t the denominator ends up being the cosine of t if i now were to plug in t
approaching zero i get zero over one which is zero a proper solution remembering this is the limit of the
natural log of y which is never what i was interested in i was interested in the limit of
y i remember mathematically i can write y as e to the power natural log of y
i take the limit now of y on the left hand side means means i've got to take the limit of e to the
power natural log of y my laws of limits allow me to take that limit up to the variable itself leaving
the constant alone i've just done it i know that the limit st approaches zero from the positive side of
the natural log of y is zero look one two lines up i've done that i can plug in zero there it's e to
the power zero which is one which my graph shows on the left hand side this is a beautiful beautiful
problem don't you think let's go into the last one we have the limit as t approaches infinity of t plus one
to the power two over t and plug in infinity you're going to get infinity to the power zero it's one of the
five difficult ones you have to go down a few blind alleys until you get out of trouble what did we do
before if we can't manipulate that algebraically we introduce a new variable why we take the natural
log of both sides we take now the limit of the natural log of y as opposed to y you see i've replaced
y there with what i've what i have t plus one over two over t i rewrite that because i can now bring
the two over t in front of the natural log sign we see it there and lo and behold if i were to replace
t now with infinity i get zero times infinity that's another one of those that i can't really do anything about
i rewrite it though see the two brown circles just an algebraic rewrite it's two times the natural log
of t plus one over t if i were to plug in t equals infinity now i get infinity of infinity indeterminate
form proper indeterminate form apply l'hôpital's rule and what do i end up with two over t plus one
if i take the limit as t approaches zero of that i get zero once again remembering that was the limit of
the natural log of y not the limit of of y itself same as before y equals e to the power natural log
of y i take the limit of y i take the limit of e to the power natural log of y i can take the limit up
into the power because e is a constant i've just checked that the limit as t approaches zero of the
natural log of y is zero i can replace that with zero that's e to the power zero and we end up with one
as we can see the graph on the right hand bottom now these are wonderful problems sometimes you're
going to sit with them for so long but it's a challenge you are an investigator a private
investigator you are sherlock holmes whoever you want to be and you've got this problem that you've
got to solve you're going to sit with it you're going to fight with it but you've got some tools in
your bag now try all of them the most difficult ones are the ones that you have to decide to multiply
both the numerator and denominator by something that will lead you to a path that's not blocked
good luck with those enjoy them they are fantastic problems to try and solve
