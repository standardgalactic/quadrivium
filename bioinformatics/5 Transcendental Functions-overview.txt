This text introduces and explores transcendental functions, which are defined for this lecture as non-polynomial functions. Examples include trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent), logarithms (logarithm and natural log), and exponential functions like \(a^x\) or Euler's number raised to a power.

The text provides basic limits for these functions as the variable approaches certain values. For example:
- The limit of \(\sin(t)\) as \(t\) approaches a constant is simply \(\sin(a)\).
- The natural log function, \(\ln(x)\), is only defined for positive values.
- Arc functions like \(\arcsin(t)\) and \(\arccos(t)\) are restricted between -1 and 1.

The text discusses specific limit scenarios:
- For \(\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\arcsin(t)}{\sqrt{2}}\), it explains how the domain restrictions of \(\arcsin\) apply.
- The limit \(\lim_{t \to 0} t \cdot e^{-3t} + \frac{1}{2t^2 + t}\) is simplified by factoring out \(t\) in the denominator, resulting in a straightforward evaluation using substitution.

The behavior of trigonometric functions as \(t\) approaches infinity is also examined:
- Sine and cosine do not have limits at infinity due to their periodic nature.
- Tangent tends towards positive or negative infinity near its vertical asymptotes.
- \(\arctan(t)\) has a limit of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) as \(t\) approaches infinity.

The text concludes with an explanation of the squeeze theorem, using graphs of \(t^2\), \(-t^2\), and \(\frac{1}{2}t^2\) to illustrate how limits can be determined by bounding functions. The theorem states that if a function is squeezed between two others whose limits are equal at a certain point, then the squeezed function must also have that limit at the same point.

The text provides an overview of limits involving transcendental functions. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Limit as \( t \to 0 \) for \( t^2 \sin(\frac{1}{t}) \):**
   - Direct substitution leads to an indeterminate form, but by observing that \( t^2 \) is bounded above and below by \( t^2 \) and \(-t^2\) respectively, it's concluded that the limit is 0.

2. **Piecewise Defined Functions:**
   - An example of a piecewise function is given with different expressions for \( t < 0 \) and \( t > 0 \). The limits from the left (\(4\)) and right (\(-3\)) at \( t = 0 \) are not equal, so the overall limit does not exist.

3. **Memorable Limits:**
   - The limit of \( \frac{\sin t}{t} \) as \( t \to 0 \) is 1. This can be memorized or derived by evaluating values closer to 0.
   - Similarly, the limit of \( \frac{t}{\sin t} \) as \( t \to 0 \) is also 1.

4. **Limit Involving Sine Squared:**
   - For \( \frac{\sin^2 t}{t^2} \), using the identity \(\left( \frac{\sin t}{t} \right)^2\), and knowing that \( \frac{\sin t}{t} \to 1 \) as \( t \to 0 \), the limit is calculated to be 1.

The text emphasizes understanding and memorizing these fundamental limits for transcendental functions, which are commonly encountered in calculus.
