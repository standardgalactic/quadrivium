This text introduces and explores transcendental functions, which are defined for this lecture as non-polynomial functions. Examples include trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent), logarithms (logarithm and natural log), and exponential functions like \(a^x\) or Euler's number raised to a power.

The text provides basic limits for these functions as the variable approaches certain values. For example:
- The limit of \(\sin(t)\) as \(t\) approaches a constant is simply \(\sin(a)\).
- The natural log function, \(\ln(x)\), is only defined for positive values.
- Arc functions like \(\arcsin(t)\) and \(\arccos(t)\) are restricted between -1 and 1.

The text discusses specific limit scenarios:
- For \(\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\arcsin(t)}{\sqrt{2}}\), it explains how the domain restrictions of \(\arcsin\) apply.
- The limit \(\lim_{t \to 0} t \cdot e^{-3t} + \frac{1}{2t^2 + t}\) is simplified by factoring out \(t\) in the denominator, resulting in a straightforward evaluation using substitution.

The behavior of trigonometric functions as \(t\) approaches infinity is also examined:
- Sine and cosine do not have limits at infinity due to their periodic nature.
- Tangent tends towards positive or negative infinity near its vertical asymptotes.
- \(\arctan(t)\) has a limit of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) as \(t\) approaches infinity.

The text concludes with an explanation of the squeeze theorem, using graphs of \(t^2\), \(-t^2\), and \(\frac{1}{2}t^2\) to illustrate how limits can be determined by bounding functions. The theorem states that if a function is squeezed between two others whose limits are equal at a certain point, then the squeezed function must also have that limit at the same point.

The text provides an overview of limits involving transcendental functions. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Limit as \( t \to 0 \) for \( t^2 \sin(\frac{1}{t}) \):**
   - Direct substitution leads to an indeterminate form, but by observing that \( t^2 \) is bounded above and below by \( t^2 \) and \(-t^2\) respectively, it's concluded that the limit is 0.

2. **Piecewise Defined Functions:**
   - An example of a piecewise function is given with different expressions for \( t < 0 \) and \( t > 0 \). The limits from the left (\(4\)) and right (\(-3\)) at \( t = 0 \) are not equal, so the overall limit does not exist.

3. **Memorable Limits:**
   - The limit of \( \frac{\sin t}{t} \) as \( t \to 0 \) is 1. This can be memorized or derived by evaluating values closer to 0.
   - Similarly, the limit of \( \frac{t}{\sin t} \) as \( t \to 0 \) is also 1.

4. **Limit Involving Sine Squared:**
   - For \( \frac{\sin^2 t}{t^2} \), using the identity \(\left( \frac{\sin t}{t} \right)^2\), and knowing that \( \frac{\sin t}{t} \to 1 \) as \( t \to 0 \), the limit is calculated to be 1.

The text emphasizes understanding and memorizing these fundamental limits for transcendental functions, which are commonly encountered in calculus.

This text introduces transcendental functions, which are defined as functions not classified as polynomials. Examples include trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent), logarithms, and exponential functions like Euler's number raised to a power or a constant raised to the power of variables.

Key points discussed:

1. **Basic Limits**: The text illustrates simple limits for these transcendental functions as a variable approaches a constant:
   - \(\lim_{t \to c} \sin(t) = \sin(c)\)
   - Similar results apply to cosine, exponentials, and natural logs, but note that natural log is only defined for values greater than zero.

2. **Inverse Trigonometric Functions**: Arc functions like arc sine and arc cosine are limited to input values between -1 and 1 due to the range of their base trigonometric functions. An example limit involving arc sine is provided:
   \[
   \lim_{t \to 0} \sin^{-1}\left(t + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
   \]
   Here, plugging \( t = 0 \) directly into the expression gives a result aligned with these constraints.

3. **Behavior at Infinity**:
   - Sine and cosine functions oscillate indefinitely as \( t \to \pm \infty \), so they have no limits in that context.
   - Tangent has vertical asymptotes at certain values, where it approaches infinity; hence, its limit does not exist there.
   - Arc tangent, however, settles to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) as \( t \to \pm \infty \).

4. **Squeeze Theorem**: This theorem is used to find limits of functions trapped between two others:
   - For example, if a function \( f(t) \) (the orange graph in the text) lies between \(-t^2\) and \(t^2\), then:
     \[
     \lim_{t \to 0} -t^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{t \to 0} t^2 = 0
     \]
   - Thus, the limit of \( f(t) \) as \( t \to 0 \) is also 0.

The text emphasizes understanding the behavior of transcendental functions through limits and graphical analysis.

The text provides an overview of evaluating limits involving transcendental functions, specifically focusing on behaviors as \( t \) approaches zero.

1. **Limit of \( t^2 \sin(1/t) \):** As \( t \) approaches 0, directly substituting would lead to an indeterminate form (0 times undefined). However, since the function is bounded by \( -t^2 \) and \( t^2 \), which both approach 0 as \( t \to 0 \), it can be concluded that the limit of \( t^2 \sin(1/t) \) is also 0.

2. **Piecewise Defined Functions:** An example with a piecewise function where one side approaches 4 and the other -3 as \( t \to 0 \). The left-hand and right-hand limits are not equal, hence the overall limit does not exist.

3. **Memorizing Specific Limits:**
   - The limit of \( \sin(t)/t \) as \( t \to 0 \) is 1. This can be memorized or approximated by evaluating values closer to zero.
   - Similarly, the limit of \( t/\sin(t) \) as \( t \to 0 \) is also 1.

4. **Limit of \( (\sin^2(t))/t^2 \):** Using limit laws, this can be broken down into \((\sin(t)/t)(\sin(t)/t)\), which evaluates to \(1 \times 1 = 1\) as each \(\sin(t)/t\) approaches 1.

The text emphasizes understanding and memorizing these specific limits for transcendental functions, providing foundational knowledge useful for calculus applications.
