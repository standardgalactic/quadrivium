The text discusses concepts related to thermodynamics and ideal gases using PV diagrams. Here's a summary:

1. **Isotherms and Processes:**
   - Two isotherms are presented, differing only by temperature (\(T\) and \(T + \Delta T\)).
   - The processes described include:
     - Isochoric (constant volume): No work done as volume doesn't change.
     - Isobaric (constant pressure): Pressure remains constant during the process.

2. **First Law of Thermodynamics:**
   - The internal energy change (\(\Delta E_{internal}\)) is given by \(Q - W\), where \(Q\) is heat added and \(W\) is work done.
   - For these processes, \(\Delta E_{internal} = N C_v \Delta T\).

3. **Molar Specific Heat:**
   - At constant volume (\(C_v\)), internal energy change depends on temperature difference alone.
   - At constant pressure (\(C_p\)), \(Q\) is given by \(N C_p \Delta T\).
   - The relationship between molar specific heats is \(C_p = C_v + R\).

4. **Application Example:**
   - A problem involves a monatomic ideal gas (e.g., helium) in a bubble heated at constant pressure.
   - Heat transferred (\(Q\)) to the gas can be calculated using \(Q = N C_p \Delta T\).
   - The change in internal energy is given by \(\Delta E_{internal} = N C_v \Delta T\).

5. **Key Points:**
   - For monatomic gases, \(C_v = \frac{3}{2}R\) and \(C_p = \frac{5}{2}R\).
   - The change in internal energy depends solely on the temperature difference (\(\Delta T\)), regardless of the path taken between isotherms.

The text emphasizes understanding how heat transfer, work, and changes in internal energy are related through the first law of thermodynamics and specific heats at constant volume and pressure.

The text discusses the process of calculating changes in internal energy and work done by helium gas as it expands, using thermodynamic equations. 

1. **Change in Internal Energy**: The change in internal energy (\(\Delta E_{\text{internal}}\)) is calculated using the formula \((3/2)NR\Delta T\). Here, \(N\) is the number of moles, \(R\) is the gas constant (given as 3), and \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature.

2. **Work Done by Gas**: There are two methods to calculate the work done by helium during expansion under constant pressure:
   - Using the formula for work done at constant pressure (\(W = P\Delta V\)). Since \(P\Delta V = NR\Delta T\) from the ideal gas law, work can be calculated as \(NR\Delta T\).
   - Applying the first law of thermodynamics, which states that \(\Delta E_{\text{internal}} = Q - W\), where \(Q\) is heat added to the system. Rearranging gives \(W = Q - \Delta E_{\text{internal}}\).

3. **Consistency Check**: Both methods should yield the same result for work done, serving as a consistency check.

The text emphasizes not confusing these equations and understanding their applications in real-life thermodynamic processes.
