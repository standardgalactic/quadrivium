The text discusses the concept of standing waves and how to interpret the harmonic number \( n \) in wave equations. It emphasizes understanding harmonics visually, such as drawing patterns on paper or mentally, to avoid mistakes. The explanation starts with the fundamental wave (first harmonic), where a node-antinode-node pattern is observed. Additional half wavelengths are added sequentially to form second, third, and fourth harmonics.

The text explains how the wavelength (\( \lambda \)) for each harmonic relates to the length \( L \) of the medium: 

- First harmonic: \( \lambda = 2L \)
- Second harmonic: \( \lambda = L \)
- Third harmonic: \( \lambda = \frac{2}{3}L \)
- Fourth harmonic: \( \lambda = \frac{1}{2}L \)

This leads to the formula for wavelength in terms of harmonics: 

\[ \lambda = \frac{2L}{N} \]

where \( N \) is a positive integer representing the harmonic number. The frequency (\( f \)) is then derived as:

\[ f = \frac{nV}{2L} \]

where \( V \) is the wave velocity.

A practical example involves calculating the mass required for a rope to resonate at a specific frequency in its fourth harmonic state. Given parameters include the rope's length, linear density, and resonant frequency. The velocity of the wave on the rope is determined by:

\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \]

where \( T = mg \) (tension due to gravity). Using the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and velocity, the mass (\( m \)) can be calculated:

\[ n = \frac{4L^2 f^2 \mu}{g} \]

This example illustrates using harmonic numbers in wave problems involving fixed boundaries.

The text describes an experiment involving two strings made from the same piece of rope with different lengths. The first string (A) has a length \( L \), while the second string (B) is four times longer, at \( 4L \). Both strings are under the same tension and have identical linear density.

The goal is to compare the harmonic frequencies of these two strings. For string A, the harmonics range from \( F_1 \) to \( F_8 \), corresponding to modes \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 8 \). Similarly, for string B, the frequencies range from \( F_{B1} \) to \( F_{B8} \).

The frequency of a harmonic is given by the formula:

\[
F = \frac{n v}{2L}
\]

where \( n \) is the harmonic number and \( v \) is the wave velocity. Since both strings are made from the same material and under the same tension, they share the same wave velocity.

For string A:
\[ F_{An} = \frac{n_A v}{2L} \]

For string B:
\[ F_{Bn} = \frac{n_B v}{8L} \]

To find which harmonics of string B match those of string A, we equate their frequencies:

\[
\frac{n_A v}{2L} = \frac{n_B v}{8L}
\]

Simplifying gives:
\[ n_B = 4n_A \]

This means that the \( n_B \) harmonic on string B matches the \( n_A \) harmonic on string A if \( n_B = 4n_A \).

Thus, for the first eight harmonics of string A (\( n_A = 1 \) to \( 8 \)), we find:

- \( F_{A1} \) (first harmonic of A) matches with \( F_{B4} \) (fourth harmonic of B).
- \( F_{A2} \) (second harmonic of A) matches with \( F_{B8} \) (eighth harmonic of B).

The third harmonic of string A (\( n_A = 3 \)) would correspond to the twelfth harmonic of string B (\( n_B = 12 \)), which is beyond the first eight harmonics considered for string B.

Therefore, only the fourth and eighth harmonics of string B match with the first and second harmonics of string A, respectively.
