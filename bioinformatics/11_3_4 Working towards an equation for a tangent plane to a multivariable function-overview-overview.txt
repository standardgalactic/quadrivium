The text provides methods for analyzing whether functions of two variables have a tangent plane at specific points by examining limits along various paths or curves. It focuses on determining if these limits are consistent across different approaches, which is crucial for establishing the presence of a tangent plane.

The first function analyzed is \( z = f(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{x - y} \), defined for all real numbers except where \( x = y \). To determine if there's a tangent plane at \( (0, 0) \), curves passing through this point are considered:

1. **Curve along the x-axis**: By setting \( y = 0 \), the limit as \( (x, y) \to (0, 0) \) is found to be 1.
   
2. **Curve along the y-axis**: By setting \( x = 0 \), the limit as \( y \to 0 \) is -1.

The differing limits indicate that the overall limit at \( (0, 0) \) does not exist, meaning there is no tangent plane at this point.

A second function, \( z = f(x, y) = \frac{x - y}{x + y} \), excludes only the point \( (0, 0) \). Evaluating along a path where \( x = 0 \), the limit depends on the direction of approach for \( y \to 0 \): it tends to positive infinity from the negative side and negative infinity from the positive side. This inconsistency means no tangent plane exists at \( (0, 0) \).

Overall, these analyses employ single-variable calculus techniques in a multi-dimensional context to assess limit existence and determine if tangent planes exist for functions of two variables.
