The text provides an overview of using SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, to handle mathematical limits. It explains how to import SymPy with the abbreviation `SYM` and set up a variable as a symbol. The text demonstrates calculating limits using the `limit` function in SymPy. For instance, it shows finding the limit of sin(X)/X as X approaches zero, resulting in 1.

The text also introduces handling infinity symbols within SymPy, where double lowercase 'oo' represents infinity (e.g., `SYM.oo`). It explains evaluating limits at infinity, such as the limit of 1/X as X approaches infinity, which is 0.

Furthermore, it discusses one-sided limits, illustrating how to approach a limit from either direction using the `dir` argument in SymPy. Examples include approaching zero from positive or negative sides, yielding positive or negative infinity, respectively.

Finally, the text mentions handling negative infinity in expressions and executing code efficiently within Python, particularly noting compatibility with Python 2.7.6 for specific syntax requirements.
