In this short series we're going to talk about, well pulling it a series is a bit funny if you think about it,
we're going to work with sequences before we get to series.
So just a quick look at a sequence. What is a sequence?
Well we define a sequence as an ordered set of values.
So I will have a set of values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
So that is a sequence. I'm not adding these together, it's not a series.
It's just a sequence and it's ordered. The 2 and the 3 are not, if I change those around,
that would not be the same sequence as this sequence.
And for a sequence, what you've got to first understand is a sequence can form a graph for us.
We need to look at a graph now on the x, y coordinate system.
But what do we mean by the sequence?
In a sequence, number 1, we deal with integers.
Number 2 is we usually use set notation.
So instead of writing the f of x equals x,
I'm going to say that the f of n equals n.
And the reason we use n as a variable and not x is that by n we mean positive integers starting at 1.
Hence, fact number 2, we usually use not equation notation like that,
but we use set notation, so we're going to write a n equals n, for instance.
And we can also write this as such.
We can put the curly braces, it's going to be n,
and from n equals 1 to infinity.
And that is going to be this sequence that I have right here.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and so it goes.
And so it goes.
But I can graph this as well.
But because this is not a function, this is not a continuous graph.
In other words, I can't take the derivative of this.
I can't take the first derivative of this
because my graph is not continuous.
So for n equals 1, a n is also going to be 1,
and then it's going to be 2, and then it's going to be 3,
and then it's going to be 4.
So it's not a straight line.
It is not a straight line because when we deal with sequences,
we're only dealing with positive integers.
So my graph is purely going to be these specific oddments,
1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, etc.
So I can draw a graph of this,
but remember that it is not continuous,
and therefore I can't take the first derivative.
And it's going to become important very shortly.
So this is what a sequence is, an order.
So there's order in that sequence.
They can't be disordered,
and then it's a different sequence.
So it's an ordered set of values.
I'm not adding them as one, a series.
And we don't use function notation.
Like here, we usually use set notation,
which we can write as such,
and the graph of it is going to be just
the sequence of dots,
the sequence of coordinates.
Now that we know what a sequence of real numbers are,
and we know how that we can plot them
as specific points on a graph,
we need to know,
or the most important thing we want to know
is what happens in the limit as n goes to infinity.
Now let's look at an example.
Let's say that a of n equals 1 over n squared,
and we're going to denote that as follows.
We're going to just put the curly braces,
1 over n squared,
from n equals 1 to infinity.
So we need to know what happens when n goes to infinity.
And there are two possibilities.
One, it converges,
and that converges to a specific number
that we will denote as L.
or if that does not converge,
if this graph of dots,
of coordinates,
does not converge to a,
let me draw it again.
I can see the faint outline of the previous one.
Clearly, in our first example,
as n goes to infinity,
a of n,
remember this is now going to be n,
and this is a of n,
does not converge to a single value.
It's going to go up to infinity.
So that kind of equation,
we will say it diverges,
because it does not go to a specific value L.
Let's look at 1 over n squared, though.
What will happen to 1 over n squared?
Let's put our n values there.
Let's put our a of n values there.
Let's just quickly see what's going to happen.
1 over 1 is 1.
If n becomes 2,
it's going to be 1 over 2 squared.
So 1 is 1.
So 2 is going to be a quarter.
What's going to happen to 3?
It's going to be 3 squared is 9.
So that's 1 over 9.
1 over 9.
Let's do 4.
4 is going to be 1 over 16.
And I think you can clearly see
that we are looking at this.
If that's 1,
we're looking at...
I'm being very rough now.
But we're looking at this sort of situation.
It is going to clearly converge to...
On a graph of these dots,
it's going to converge to 1.
So it does reach a certain value L.
So this would be a converging
versus a diverging function,
as it stands there,
because it converges to a single point.
And we'll have to look at ways in which we can...
tools in which we can use to test
to see whether a function...
a function of this sequence
is divergent or convergent.
Before we get to these tools,
let's just look at a definition.
A definition that you can use,
a mathematical definition
of what this convergence is.
And it states,
and we've seen it before with low intersection,
if we choose any value,
a value n,
and for any n then greater than that n,
there will be a value that we get
for our sequence
at that specific n value,
minus, if there is convergence,
that value that we are converging to
so much that that would be
the difference between those,
and the absolute value
of the difference between those,
is smaller than epsilon
for any value epsilon more than zero.
What this means is,
if I let n go sufficiently large
as it tends then towards infinity,
the difference between the value
of the sequence
and that specific sequence,
that specific spot in the sequence,
minus this value,
I will always get smaller and smaller,
it will always get closer and closer,
there will be some maximum.
And from this you can clearly see
that it is going towards one point.
So for any value epsilon larger than zero,
and then for any value of n larger
than whatever specific n value we took,
the difference between this
and the sequence value,
and the value that it does converge,
is then smaller than epsilon.
So that is your mathematical,
it's not like we,
you know,
we will usually get these in the exam,
or to prove,
or to test in some,
as opposed to some courses you will.
But it's easy enough to understand
what is meant by this equation,
inasmuch as it is converging onto this,
it is converging onto this value.
And then if it doesn't,
obviously,
the sequence is diverging.
Okay,
if all of that was a bit too difficult to explain,
let's start looking at examples.
It always makes things clearer,
doesn't it?
Now,
we have a sequence of real numbers,
and our sequence is
5 times n to minus 3 over,
or divided by 2n plus 7,
and we're going from n equals 1 to infinity,
so that is notation for a sequence.
And if I want to know
whether this sequence converges or diverges,
I want to know what happens in the limit
as n goes to infinity.
That's what I'm interested in.
Then if n gets larger and larger
and goes to infinity,
and I start putting my dots,
does it converge to a single value,
L, remember,
or doesn't it?
And as n approaches infinity,
remember,
my sequence a n minus L
is going to be smaller than
that very small value epsilon
that I chose.
It's going to get smaller and smaller
and smaller and smaller.
The difference between
the sequence dots
and this value L on the y-axis.
Okay,
so I want to know
what happens in the limit
as n goes to infinity
of this sequence a n.
So that is the limit
as n goes to infinity of
5n minus 3
over 2n plus 7.
That's what I want to know.
That's what I want to know.
I can just put normal brackets around this.
Now,
if I just plug infinity in infinity,
I'm going to get infinity over infinity,
which,
if you remember from limits,
is indeterminate form.
Now,
if we have the indeterminate form
as infinity over infinity,
you think we can apply
L'Hôpital's rule,
but you cannot
because L'Hôpital's rule says,
well,
you need to take the first derivative
of this
and take the first derivative
of this,
but neither of these
are continuous polynomials.
Neither of these
are continuous functions.
They have huge gaps in between
because in sequences,
we're only dealing
with positive integers,
remember.
So I can't take the first derivative
of that
and the first derivative
of that to solve the problem.
So I need,
but there is one special case
where you can actually do that
and we'll get to it.
What I need to do here,
or the only way out for me
in this instance,
is the limit
as n goes to infinity,
is actually to divide
the numerator
and the denominator
by the highest-powered
variable in the denominator,
which is this n
to the power of 1.
So I'm going to divide
both the numerator
and the denominator
by that.
If I divide this by n,
I'm going to get
5 minus 3 over n,
and here I'm going to get
2 plus 7 over n.
Now I can take the limit
because 3 divided by infinity
is 0.
7 divided by,
what did I write here?
That should be n.
Now,
7 divided by infinity
is also 0,
so I'm going to be left
with 5 over 2.
So this is my 5 over 2.
This is my l value.
So the limit
as n goes to infinity
of this sequence
is definitely going to reach
2 and a half.
Okay,
so this function,
not a function,
this sequence,
it's a sequence,
has a,
is convergent
and it converges
to 2 and a half.
