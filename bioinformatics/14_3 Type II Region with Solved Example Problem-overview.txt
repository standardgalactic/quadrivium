To solve the double integral over the specified regions, we need to carefully analyze the geometry described and convert it into an appropriate mathematical formulation.

### Geometry Analysis

The problem describes a region bounded by:
- Two curves: \( y = f_1(x) \) and \( y = f_2(x) \).
- Vertical lines at \( x = a \) and \( x = b \).

The region can be visualized as being sandwiched between these two curves from \( x = a \) to \( x = b \). The goal is to set up the double integral over this region.

### Setting Up the Double Integral

Given the description, the region \( R \) can be defined as:
\[ R = \{ (x, y) \mid a \leq x \leq b, f_1(x) \leq y \leq f_2(x) \} \]

The double integral over this region is expressed as:
\[
\int_{a}^{b} \int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(x, y) \, dy \, dx
\]
where \( g(x, y) \) is the function being integrated.

### Solving the Integral

To solve this integral, follow these steps:

1. **Integrate with respect to \( y \):**
   - Compute the inner integral:
     \[
     \int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(x, y) \, dy
     \]
   - This will yield a function of \( x \).

2. **Integrate with respect to \( x \):**
   - Compute the outer integral using the result from step 1:
     \[
     \int_{a}^{b} \left( \text{result from inner integral} \right) \, dx
     \]

### Example

Suppose \( g(x, y) = xy \), then:

1. **Inner Integral:**
   \[
   \int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} xy \, dy = x \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} = x \left( \frac{(f_2(x))^2}{2} - \frac{(f_1(x))^2}{2} \right)
   \]

2. **Outer Integral:**
   \[
   \int_{a}^{b} x \left( \frac{(f_2(x))^2}{2} - \frac{(f_1(x))^2}{2} \right) \, dx
   \]

This integral can be evaluated using standard calculus techniques.

### Conclusion

The key is to correctly identify the limits of integration and ensure the region is properly described. By transforming the problem into a single type 1 region, you simplify the process of setting up and evaluating the double integral.

To solve the integral problem you described, let's break it down step by step:

### Problem Setup

You're integrating over a region defined by two curves: \( y = \sqrt{4 - x^2} \) (a semicircle) and \( y = 0 \), with vertical boundaries at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \sqrt{2} \).

### Change of Variables

You correctly identified that you can use substitution to simplify the integral. Let's focus on the integral involving \( \sqrt{4 - y^2} \):

1. **Substitution**:  
   Let \( u = 4 - y^2 \). Then, \( du = -2y \, dy \) or \( y \, dy = -\frac{1}{2} \, du \).

2. **Limits of Integration**:  
   When \( y = 0 \), \( u = 4 \).  
   When \( y = \sqrt{2} \), \( u = 2 \).

3. **Integral Transformation**:  
   The integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{4 - y^2} \, dy = \int_{4}^{2} \sqrt{u} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \, du
   \]
   Simplifying, this becomes:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \int_{2}^{4} u^{1/2} \, du
   \]

4. **Evaluate the Integral**:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \right]_{2}^{4} = \frac{1}{3} \left[ (4)^{3/2} - (2)^{3/2} \right]
   \]
   Calculate:
   \[
   (4)^{3/2} = 8, \quad (2)^{3/2} = 2\sqrt{2}
   \]
   So the integral evaluates to:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (8 - 2\sqrt{2})
   \]

### Complete Solution

Now, combine this with the other parts of your original problem:

1. **Integral of Constant**:  
   \(\int_{0}^{\sqrt{2}} 8 \, dy = 8y \bigg|_0^{\sqrt{2}} = 8\sqrt{2}\)

2. **Integral of \( y^2 \)**:  
   \(\int_{0}^{\sqrt{2}} y^2 \, dy = \frac{1}{3} y^3 \bigg|_0^{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{3} (2\sqrt{2}) = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}\)

3. **Combine All Parts**:  
   The total integral is:
   \[
   8\sqrt{2} - 3 \left(\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}\right) + \frac{1}{3} (8 - 2\sqrt{2})
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   = 8\sqrt{2} - 2\sqrt{2} + \frac{8}{3} - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}
   \]
   Combine terms:
   \[
   = \left(8\sqrt{2} - 2\sqrt{2} - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}\right) + \frac{8}{3}
   \]
   \[
   = \left(\frac{24\sqrt{2}}{3} - \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{3} - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}\right) + \frac{8}{3}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{16\sqrt{2}}{3} + \frac{8}{3}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{3}
\]
