To solve the double integral over the specified regions, we need to carefully analyze the geometry described and convert it into an appropriate mathematical formulation.

### Geometry Analysis

The problem describes a region bounded by:
- Two curves: \( y = f_1(x) \) and \( y = f_2(x) \).
- Vertical lines at \( x = a \) and \( x = b \).

The region can be visualized as being sandwiched between these two curves from \( x = a \) to \( x = b \). The goal is to set up the double integral over this region.

### Setting Up the Double Integral

Given the description, the region \( R \) can be defined as:
\[ R = \{ (x, y) \mid a \leq x \leq b, f_1(x) \leq y \leq f_2(x) \} \]

The double integral over this region is expressed as:
\[
\int_{a}^{b} \int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(x, y) \, dy \, dx
\]
where \( g(x, y) \) is the function being integrated.

### Solving the Integral

To solve this integral, follow these steps:

1. **Integrate with respect to \( y \):**
   - Compute the inner integral:
     \[
     \int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(x, y) \, dy
     \]
   - This will yield a function of \( x \).

2. **Integrate with respect to \( x \):**
   - Compute the outer integral using the result from step 1:
     \[
     \int_{a}^{b} \left( \text{result from inner integral} \right) \, dx
     \]

### Example

Suppose \( g(x, y) = xy \), then:

1. **Inner Integral:**
   \[
   \int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} xy \, dy = x \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} = x \left( \frac{(f_2(x))^2}{2} - \frac{(f_1(x))^2}{2} \right)
   \]

2. **Outer Integral:**
   \[
   \int_{a}^{b} x \left( \frac{(f_2(x))^2}{2} - \frac{(f_1(x))^2}{2} \right) \, dx
   \]

This integral can be evaluated using standard calculus techniques.

### Conclusion

The key is to correctly identify the limits of integration and ensure the region is properly described. By transforming the problem into a single type 1 region, you simplify the process of setting up and evaluating the double integral.
