The lecture on complex numbers covers the basics of arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, and multiplication—on these numbers, which are defined as \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part with \( i \) being the imaginary unit.

**Addition**: To add two complex numbers \( z_1 = a_1 + b_1i \) and \( z_2 = a_2 + b_2i \), you simply combine their real parts and imaginary parts separately:  
\[ z_1 + z_2 = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2)i. \]

**Subtraction**: For subtracting \( z_2 \) from \( z_1 \), distribute the negative sign across \( z_2 \) and then combine like terms:  
\[ z_1 - z_2 = (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)i. \]

**Multiplication**: Multiplying two complex numbers involves using the distributive property, similar to binomial multiplication in algebra:
\[ 
z_1 \times z_2 = (a_1 + b_1i)(a_2 + b_2i) = a_1a_2 + a_1b_2i + a_2b_1i + b_1b_2i^2.
\]
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), the expression simplifies to:
\[ 
z_1 \times z_2 = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)i. 
\]

The lecture emphasizes that operations with complex numbers are straightforward, akin to working with binomials in algebra. It provides detailed steps for multiplying complex numbers using the FOIL method and gives an example of multiplication:

- For \( z_1 = 3 + 4i \) and \( z_2 = 2 + 2i \), calculate:
  - Real part: \(3 \times 2 - 4 \times 2 = 6 - 8 = -2\).
  - Imaginary part: \(3 \times 2 + 4 \times 2 = 6 + 8 = 14i\).

The result is \(-2 + 14i\). The text highlights the importance of using familiar multiplication rules and remembering that \( i^2 = -1 \) to effectively handle complex numbers, encouraging practice with these operations for better understanding.
