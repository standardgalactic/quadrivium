The text explains how to solve a linear, second-order, non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. Here's a summarized breakdown:

1. **General Solution Approach**: The solution is composed of two parts: the complementary solution (\(y_c\)) and the particular solution (\(y_p\)).

2. **Complementary Solution**:
   - Start by solving the homogeneous version: \(y'' + 4y' - 2y = 0\).
   - This leads to the auxiliary equation: \(m^2 + 4m - 2 = 0\).
   - Solving this quadratic gives roots \(m_1 = -2 + \sqrt{6}\) and \(m_2 = -2 - \sqrt{6}\).
   - Thus, the complementary solution is \(y_c = c_1 e^{(-2+\sqrt{6})x} + c_2 e^{(-2-\sqrt{6})x}\).

3. **Particular Solution**:
   - The non-homogeneous term is a polynomial: \(2x^2 - 3x + 6\).
   - Assume a particular solution of the form \(y_p = ax^2 + bx + c\).
   - Calculate derivatives: \(y'_p = 2ax + b\) and \(y''_p = 2a\).
   - Substitute into the differential equation to find coefficients:
     - \(-2a = 2\) (solving for \(x^2\) terms),
     - \(8a - 2b = -3\) (for \(x\) terms),
     - \(2a + 4b - 2c = 6\) (constant terms).
   - Solving these, we get \(a = -1\), \(b = -\frac{5}{2}\), and \(c = -9\).
   - Thus, the particular solution is \(y_p = -x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 9\).

4. **General Solution**:
   - Combine both solutions: 
     \[
     y = c_1 e^{(-2+\sqrt{6})x} + c_2 e^{(-2-\sqrt{6})x} - x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x - 9
     \]

This method outlines the steps to solve such differential equations by determining both complementary and particular solutions.
