The text explains the Mean Value Theorem for integrals using an example. It demonstrates how to find the average value of the function \( f(x) = 4 - x \) over the interval from 0 to 4 and determine where this average value occurs.

1. **Average Value Calculation:**
   - The formula for the average value of a function on an interval \([a, b]\) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Average value} = \frac{\int_a^b f(x) \, dx}{b-a}
     \]
   - For \( f(x) = 4 - x \), the definite integral from 0 to 4 is calculated as follows:
     - The antiderivative of \( 4 \) is \( 4x \).
     - The antiderivative of \( -x \) is \( -\frac{1}{2}x^2 \).
   - Evaluating this from 0 to 4 gives:
     \[
     [4(4) - \frac{1}{2}(4)^2] - [4(0) - \frac{1}{2}(0)^2] = (16 - 8) - 0 = 8
     \]
   - Divide by the interval width \( 4 - 0 = 4 \):
     \[
     \text{Average value} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
     \]

2. **Finding Where Average Value Occurs:**
   - Set \( f(x) = 2 \), i.e., \( 4 - x = 2 \).
   - Solving gives \( x = 2 \).

3. **Verification with Area:**
   - The area under the curve from 0 to 4 is also calculated as 8.
   - An orange rectangle representing the average value has height 2 and width 4, giving an area of \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
   
This example illustrates how the Mean Value Theorem for integrals connects the average value of a function over an interval to the actual function values.
