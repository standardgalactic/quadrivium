The text presents an informal discussion about surgical suturing techniques, particularly emphasizing the importance of adaptability and practical experience over rigid adherence to standardized methods. The speaker highlights a common issue observed during post-surgical examinations at the University of Cape Town: bent needles after suturing simulated lacerations in an EXIT OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination). This problem illustrates that while students are taught specific techniques for exams, real-life scenarios often require adjustments.

Surgery is described as both an art and a science. Just like different artists have unique styles, surgeons must develop their own methods to ensure comfort and efficiency during procedures, ultimately benefiting patient outcomes. Initially, students learn the proper techniqueâ€”holding the needle holder at a perpendicular angle two-thirds back on the needle. However, once mastered in examinations, they should feel free to adapt these techniques for practical applications.

The speaker suggests moving the holding point of the needle further forward to prevent bending due to wrist rolling and applying force incorrectly, which can also damage tissue. This adaptation aims to reduce tension and improve the precision of suturing in tougher tissues that don't resemble the softness of simulation dummies. Overall, the message is about flexibility and learning from experience to enhance surgical practice for better patient care.

The text provides tips on effective suturing techniques. It suggests using a shorter front piece to facilitate a simple punching motion when inserting a needle through tissue, ensuring minimal angle between force and needle direction for efficiency. The author also advises against keeping the wrist bent by holding the needle holder at an orthogonal or perpendicular angle; instead, they recommend angling it between 30 and 45 degrees to keep the wrist straight, improving comfort and control during suturing. Ultimately, while learning fundamental skills is crucial, developing a personalized style that prioritizes patient care is encouraged.
