now that you know your limit laws remember the laws only when they do exist when the limit
actually exists you can apply them now let's calculate some limits we've got a lot of knowledge
now about limits let's put that knowledge to work let's calculate some limits now we've seen the
laws of limits but now we've actually got to develop a few recipes to solve these problems
let's start with the very first one we have the limit as t approaches two of t squared minus four
over two minus t well clearly i can i cannot use the limit laws here because if i were to take the
limit as t approaches two of the numerator certainly i'll get to zero but if i take the limit of as t
approaches two of the denominator that's also going to equal zero i cannot divide by zero
and therefore as it stands this limit doesn't exist it actually does but as it stands it doesn't and
you cannot use the limit laws here look at what i've done in step one here i have noticed though
that the numerator can be factorized into t minus two and t plus two that's beautiful t squared minus
four it's been factorized there what i also notice in the denominator is if i take a negative one out of
this denominator that polynomial of or of first degree in the in the denominator i get this
negative t minus two look if i distribute the negative in there i'm still going to get two minus t
and now i noticed i can cancel these two out they can cancel leaving me with a negative one in the t plus
two i can make use of a limit law now by taking this constant negative one outside of the limit
if that's outside of the limit there we are now i just have the limit as t approaches two of this
t plus two i can now just put the two in there and i have a negative four beautiful by making use of
factorization of a polynomial i can solve this problem this is the first proper way other than
just plugging in values closer and closer to as we did in the tables way a way long time ago this is
the first proper way of doing it i'm just factorizing the numerator i can cancel common factors out here
make use of my limit laws and get to a value of negative four now here's a second method and we're
actually just using our limit laws this is a beautiful example you'll note here that i can't factorize
i can't factorize at all but what i would notice that this actually just says the limit
as t approaches two of some function the f of t and in this instance there's the f of t
but this f of t is to the power one over three that's what this cube root is it's to the power one over
three which means i can actually do this or this one of my limit laws i can just take this power
outside of the limit so i can do the limit first do the limit of my function f of t and then take it
to a power third or the cube root day now this is quite an easy limit to do i can simply plug in two
two squared is four times three is 12 minus four is eight so it's just a cube root of eight and i
remember eight is two cubed to the power one over three well that's just two so in the end what what
might seem a bit difficult to do is actually quite easy i needn't even have taken out this cube root
as i've done here i might as well just have plugged the two in and i would have gotten
the cube root of eight which is two and simply got to the answer there so quite a few ways of
doing this but here we made use of the fact that we can take this power here which is actually just
to the power a third so it is this function to the power third i can take this outside of my limit day
excellent now here's an exciting example quite a difficult problem if we just look at it now
now we've just seen how to do factorization we've seen what to do just with a cube root
or just powers i should say and now we've got this very complicated example first of all if we were just
to substitute the zero in there we'll have two squared here minus two squared there again zero
divided by a zero there we cannot have this this is not going to work for us let's try something else
one thing that we could do is we can multiply this fraction out by something else if i were to multiply
it by two over two two over two is just one so i'm not changing this fraction of polynomials at all but
i'm not going to multiply it by two over two i'm going to multiply it with this where there was a
negative sign here we're going to have a positive sign there so it's the square root of t plus two
minus the square root of two i'm going to have the square root of t plus two here plus the square root
of two so i know if i do that i have this factorization issue in other words if i were to
multiply these two out by each other this is what i'm going to be left with do that it's quite a few
steps but it's quite simple algebra i'm going to be left with this now what i've done in the numerator
i've also got to do here in the denominator and let's just have that i'm just going to write the t
out so i've just got the t multiplied by this new factor in the denominator there so the numerator
becomes quite easy in that i have t plus two minus two so i'm just left with t and in the denominator
i still have my t there and these two can now cancel each other out leaving me with one over
this factor in the denominator if i were to just plug in zero into this i'm not going to be left with
this two minus two problem that i have at the top but actually a plus a positive at the bottom so i'm
going to be left with the square root of two plus the square root of two which is twice the square root
of two so quite a simple answer so always remember this little bag of trick or keep it in your bag of
tricks this multiplying out one of the two either the numerator or denominator by something which would
then make it into the factor of something which is a lot easier so so far now bag of tricks we've seen
direct substitution i just want to go over this again you can just directly substitute whatever this
limit is that we try to approach into your expression and if that works out fine that's fantastic number
two is we could factorize and number three we rationalize the numerator that's what we did in the
last example actually we rationalized the numerator so those are the three things we can do at this time
remembering our limit laws which just make things a little bit easier for us let's do this example
which one of those methods we have in our bag of tricks do you think we should try here quite
clearly we are going to just take or just decompose this into factors t squared minus 2 t minus 8 can be
rewritten as this t plus 2 and t minus 4 and the t squared minus 3 t minus 4 well that's quite easy to
deconstruct that's a t minus 4 and a t plus 1 now why did we not use the direct substitution method well
try that initially and what are you going to get you're going to get 0 over 0 now that is something
very special and in later chapters we will deal with it but now look at this we have a t minus 4 there
and a t minus 4 there now we're just left with t plus 2 t plus 2 in the numerator and t plus 1 in the
denominator if we were now to substitute 4 directly into this it is quite a simple fraction
another example we have the limit as t approaches 2 of t cubed minus t minus 6 first things first
always try direct substitution you might get an easy problem like this if we were just to substitute
2 in we'll have 8 minus 2 minus 6 and that's very simply 0. 0 is a very legitimate answer we're not
dealing with a 0 divided by 0 or 1 divided by 0 or anything like that simple direct substitution simple
