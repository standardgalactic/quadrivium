Ok, let's do some loosener exercises.
We are told that we are 6 kilometers away from
the source of the sound.
The ambient air temperature between us and the source is 14 degrees Celsius
and we want to know how long it takes for that sound to reach us.
Back to classical mechanics
velocity equals distance divided by time, in other words time
it was distance divided by velocity. We know what the distance is
it's 6 kilometers away and we need to work out the velocity.
And it is in air
and we know what happens at V0 that is 331 meters
per second, so at least we know that.
And we know that T0 is going to be 273
Kelvin. So we need to find
velocity.
And this is what we
intend to have in our equation
but we know velocity divided by velocity
zero equals V squared
root of temperature divided by temperature
zero. In other words, V squared
over V0 squared
equals T over T0
and we need
V squared. In other words
V is going to equal
V0 squared T
divided by T0
divided by T0
and the square root of that.
So that will be for us
351 meters
per second squared
meters squared
per second squared
T.
We were given T in degrees Celsius
so we need to do
273 plus 14
that's 7, that's 8, that's 2
times 287
287 Kelvin
divided by 273 Kelvin
and that will give us velocity
that we can plug in there
so it will be distance divided by this
I never got my calculator
I'll take out my calculator later
but just this divided by this
is going to give us the time that it takes
for that sound to reach us.
So it's so simple.
In this problem
we want to find out what the speed of
sound is
in neon gas
at a temperature of 27 degrees
Celsius
immediately we're going to do
273 plus 27
zero zero
300
so that's 300 Kelvin
and
do we know an equation?
yes, from the first video
we know that velocity equals the square root
gamma RT
divided by the molecular mass
Neon is a
monatomic gas
so Cp
Cv is going to be about
1.67
about 4 monatomic gases
R is the gas constant
as I said 8.314
8 point, yeah thereabouts
just look it up exactly
for you
8.314 joules per mole
per Kelvin
times 300 Kelvin
divided by the
molar mass
0.02018 kg per mole
if you feed that in there
I think it comes about
454 somewhere there
meters per second
so this is a straightforward use of
the first equation
that we looked at for velocity
in a gas
let us do a problem that's
a bit more involved
we want still to know the velocity of sound
in a diatomic ideal gas
so the new gamma is going to be about
1.40
with a density of 3.5 kilograms per cubic meter
under a pressure of
250,000 pascal
or 250,000 pascal
how do we do that?
well we know that velocity equals the square root of
gamma RT
divided by M
we know gamma, we know R
we were not given T, we were not given M
so we better remember
some other equations for these variables
if we want to solve this problem
and from our ideal gas laws
the ideal one to use
obviously will be PV equals NRT
now immediately
I don't have
volume
and I don't have the number of moles
so I need to
as we say
massage this equation a bit further
and I do remember that
N
equals
is it M divided by M
or is it M divided by small n
and that's always the confusing bit
let's just do unit analysis of this
and we can have a quick look
that'll be kilogram
and we need to get to this side
which is mole
remember
N mole
that's kilogram
and this is kilograms per mole
so indeed we are correct
as we cancel this out
bring that into the denominator
and we have moles
so that's correct
so we have PV
equals N
over
we have
instead of N
we have
mass over molecular mass
RT
and look at that
we have
RT over M
RT over M
so I just need to bring the M
on this side
and I have
PV over
mass equals
RT
divided by M
now I can substitute this in there
now I'm going to get
velocity equals
gamma
RT over M
and I'm going to come PV over M
N
now look at this
I know gamma
I know P for pressure
I don't know volume
I don't know mass
but I have mass for volume
so what can I do here
well I can just bring this down
into the denominator
but then it'll have to be
divided by
so it's gamma
P
divided by M over V
and M over V
and M over V
is nothing but
density
is mass
divided by volume
so I'm left here with
gamma
P
divided by
rho
I have
I know what gamma is
1.4
I know the pressure
and I know the density
so I can solve for
the velocity
in case you're interested
I did it
and it was
about
I think
yeah
293
or
293
meters
per second
there you go
let's have a look at this problem
one with Young's modulus
which we have to find out
so we have
a metal bar
60 centimeters long
and we are told
that
it is clamped
in the middle
oscillate on one side
so we send through
a wave
and we note
that it has
a first harmonic
so it's fundamental frequency
so it's going to develop
a standing wave
at 3 kilohertz
and
the metal has a density
of 8700 kilograms
per cubic meter
and we want to know
what Young's modulus is
what we do remember
is that
velocity equals
Young's modulus
divided by
density
in other words
we're looking at
Young's modulus
as being
velocity squared
times
times the density
rho
we do not know
what velocity is
we were not given
velocity
but
we were told
some things
that can help us
discover
now remember
in the previous video section
on transverse waves
we can see a longer
triple wave
as a transverse wave
and we said
if both sides are open
the only choice for
fundamental wave
is going to be this
remember
this side is open
to oscillate
which we have
denoted in the
y direction
this side is open
to oscillate
and the centre
is clamped
so there's got to be
a node there
so we have
anti-node node
anti-node
and we know
that this whole length
is L
which is 60 centimetres
and in that 60 centimetres
we pack in
2 quarter wavelengths
because remember
from anti-node
to node
or from node
to anti-node
is a quarter wavelength
so our L
is going to be
2 times
we can pack in
2 quarter wavelengths
so L
equals 2 times
the wavelength
half
I mean
half times the wavelength
and L is lambda
equals 2 times L
we know velocity
equals lambda
times the frequency
we were told
that's fundamental
frequency
with which we have set up
this standing wave
in other words
we're going to have
velocity equals
2 times L
times the frequency
and if we substitute
in there
we know that
Young's modulus
is going to equal
4 L squared
frequency squared
times the wavelength
and if you want
to put in these values
I think
the answer I got
is
1.1 times 10
to the power
11 newtons
per square meter
modulus
modulus
is units
of newton
per square meter
and if you do that
with these
you won't get to newton
per square meter
but if you just
take this newton
and you write that
as kilograms
meters per second
squared
you'll see
if you add
another
meters to the power
negative 3
you'll get
from there
just do it
you'll see
that
you can change
the units
that you're going to get
to get
newtons per square meter
for modulus
this problem
we have a
tuning fork
in air
and we tap the tuning fork
and it designates
284 hertz
and we're told
that the room temperature
is 25 degrees celsius
what is the wave
what is the wavelength
well we know
velocity equals
frequency times
wavelength
so wavelength
is going to be
velocity divided
by frequency
we were given
the frequency
now we need
to get the velocity
we weren't given
the velocity
but we are told
it's an air
and then it happens
25 degrees celsius
that makes it
very easy
this would be
the square root of t
divided by t0
and we need
v on its own
so we're looking
at v squared
over v0 squared
plus t over t0
and v is going to
equal the square root
of t times v0 squared
divided by t0
and for t we're going
to put 273 plus 25
that gives us
8, 9, 298 kelvin
here we're going
to put 331 meters
per second
and here we're going
to put 273
to get velocity
or we can just
then say lambda
is going to equal
the square root
of t v0 squared
over t0
divided by frequency
so those are all
values we were given
perhaps in disguise
but we were given
all of these values
so we can work out
lambda
and just if you want
to check your own
work
it works out
I think
to 1.22 meters
1.22 meters
1.22 meters
and you'll note
I'm not too accurate
here with my
in these initial problems
with my significant digits
I think in the problem
this was given as 25.0
this is 284
so we're dealing with
three significant digits
now we're going to do
a problem
with a concept
that we haven't
implicitly mentioned
before
pipe
I have an organ
an organ pipe
and its length
stays constant
the organ pipe is there
I set up a resonant
frequency of 224 hertz
and it is 15 degrees Celsius
now the next day
we play the organ again
and now it's 25 degrees Celsius
we want to know
what is that resonant frequency
going to be now
and what we need to say
that if a resonant frequency
is set up in that organ pipe
our length L
here's our organ pipe
if it resonates
it has to have
at this frequency
it has to have
a certain number of nodes
and anti-nodes in there
and
irrespective
irrespective
of what the temperature is
and what the velocity
of the sound wave
is in that organ
the same number of
nodes
and anti-nodes need to
fit in here
so this is what we never
implicitly mentioned before
that lambda 1
is going to equal lambda 2
we're not going to get
a change in the wavelength
but because velocity equals
frequency times wavelength
that means our frequency
is going to change
if lambda equals velocity
over frequency
that means
our frequency is going to change
and our velocity has to change
proportionally
to maintain a constant wavelength
and if you think about it
that is true
the velocity certainly
doesn't stay constant
does it?
because we said
that velocity
divided by the velocity
at 273 kelvin
equals the square root
of temperature divided
by 273 kelvin
so that velocity
as temperature changes
is certainly not constant
so if that's not constant
this is going to change
as well
proportionally
this is going to change
so if lambda 1
equals lambda 2
that means velocity 1
over frequency 1
is going to equal velocity 2
to frequency 2
and we are
we are
let's call that
temperature final
let's call that 1
let's call that 2
so we want
frequency 2
frequency 2
is going to be
frequency 1
velocity 2
divided by velocity 1
now
we weren't given velocity
but we were given
the two temperatures
so we can express velocity
as
remember here
we'll have velocity squared
equals t times velocity
0 squared
divided by t0
or velocity equals
the square root of this
so here we are going
to have frequency 1
times
we are going to have
velocity 2
is going to give us
temperature 2
velocity 0 squared
divided by
temperature 0
over
here we are going to have
temperature 1
times velocity 0 squared
divided by
temperature 0
so
you see what's going
to happen here
did I make a mistake
somewhere
velocity 2
velocity is going to be that
so you see what's going
to happen here
everything will cancel out
and we are going to be
left with frequency 1
times
the square root of
temperature 2
temperature 2
divided by
temperature 1
and if you want to know
the answer of that
and I hope I did it correctly
it's going to be 228
it's going to be about 228
just check on that with your calculator
just check on that with your calculator
so it's going to have a higher frequency
because indeed the velocity is going to be higher
because the temperature is higher
the heat publicly
which is giving up
which is then the meter
Speakers
because the intensity
is going to be expected
and the diameter of this
would take an event
and mainly
build the energy
that will not fall
with the temperature
and look at it
but
you see
as long as you can
come back
you see

you see
you see
