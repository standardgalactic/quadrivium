In the "Let's Talk Surgery" discussion, gallbladder carcinoma is described as a common biliary tree cancer in certain regions, primarily affecting older adults and females. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage due to its rapid local invasion and spread through venous and lymphatic systems, leading to obstructive jaundice and making surgical resection challenging. Management typically focuses on palliative care, like biliary drainage.

Risk factors for gallbladder cancer include gallstones, porcelain gallbladder (calcified gallbladder wall), adenomatous polyps, sclerosing cholangitis, infections such as salmonella in certain areas, and possibly Helicobacter pylori. Symptoms preceding diagnosis often involve biliary colic from gallstones, with rare early-stage discoveries during surgery for acute cholecystitis.

For advanced cases, comprehensive imaging and procedures like ERCPs or PTCs assess surgical options, but even after resection, the prognosis is generally poor, with survival typically less than six months post-diagnosis. Management in specialized centers is essential for proper care.
