The text discusses how differentiation works with exponential functions, particularly focusing on \( e^x \). It highlights a remarkable property: the derivative of \( e^x \) is simply \( e^x \), similar to its unique properties like those of pi. This stems from its definition and mathematical characteristics.

To extend this concept using the chain rule, if you have an exponential function where the exponent itself is a differentiable function of \( x \)—let's denote it as \( u(x) \)—the derivative of \( e^{u(x)} \) with respect to \( x \) can be found by multiplying \( e^{u(x)} \) by the derivative of \( u(x) \). This result is expressed mathematically as:

\[ \frac{d}{dx}(e^{u(x)}) = e^{u(x)} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \]

The text provides an example: for \( e^{\sin x} \), where \( u(x) = \sin x \), the derivative is calculated using the chain rule. Since the derivative of \( \sin x \) with respect to \( x \) is \( \cos x \), the derivative of \( e^{\sin x} \) becomes:

\[ \frac{d}{dx}(e^{\sin x}) = e^{\sin x} \cdot \cos x \]

This process exemplifies how exponential functions and differentiation interplay, especially when dealing with composite functions.
