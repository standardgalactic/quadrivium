Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious complication from heparin therapy characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. The focus here is on Type 2 HIT, which is immune-mediated due to antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. It typically manifests about four days after starting unfractionated heparin.

**Risk Factors for Type 2 HIT:**
- Use of unfractionated heparin
- Surgery rather than medical conditions
- Female gender, previous heparin exposure, and age over 40

**Pathophysiology:**
Type 2 HIT involves antibodies (IgG, IgM, occasionally IgA) reacting to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. This reaction activates platelets, causing them to be removed from circulation (leading to thrombocytopenia), and releases prothrombotic microparticles, resulting in thrombosis.

**Clinical Features:**
- Thrombocytopenia usually begins 5-8 days post-heparin initiation but can occur earlier if pre-existing antibodies are present.
- A typical drop in platelet count is over 50%, though counts may remain above 20,000.
- Up to 10% of patients experience thrombosis, which can manifest as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, venous gangrene, or arterial thrombosis with skin necrosis.

**Diagnosis:**
- Based on clinical assessment of risk factors and symptoms.
- Tests include the Serotonin Release Assay (high sensitivity and specificity), heparin-induced platelet aggregation, and ELISA-based immunoassays.

**Prevention and Treatment:**
- Use low molecular weight heparins or alternatives like Fondaparinux or Danaparoid to prevent HIT.
- Start Warfarin early but only after adequate anticoagulation with alternative agents.
- For diagnosed HIT:
  - Immediately discontinue all forms of heparin.
  - Administer alternative anticoagulants (e.g., Lepirudin for liver impairment, Gatraban for renal impairment).
  - Initiate Warfarin only when the patient is adequately anticoagulated with alternatives and has a platelet count above 150,000 to avoid thrombotic complications. 

The text emphasizes careful management of warfarin initiation to prevent further thrombotic events.
