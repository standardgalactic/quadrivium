The text provides an overview of electric potential energy stored in capacitors and how this can be expressed as energy density. It begins by deriving the formula for electric potential energy \( U \) in a capacitor: 

\[ U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 \]

where \( C \) is capacitance, and \( V \) is voltage across the capacitor. The concept of energy density \( u \), which is the energy per unit volume, is introduced as:

\[ u = \frac{\epsilon_0 E^2}{2} \]

with \( \epsilon_0 \) being the permittivity of free space and \( E \) the electric field.

The discussion extends to an isolated spherical capacitor, utilizing the formula for capacitance \( C = 4\pi\epsilon_0 R \). For a sphere with radius 0.0685 meters charged with 1.25 nanocoulombs, the potential energy is calculated as approximately 103 nanojoules.

The text also addresses capacitors in series and parallel configurations within electrical circuits. The equivalent capacitance for capacitors in parallel is the sum of their individual capacitances, while for those in series it follows:

\[ \frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \cdots \]

The text guides through solving problems involving these configurations and finding the charge on a specific capacitor given capacitances and potential difference.

Key points include:
- **Capacitance Calculation**: An equivalent capacitance \( C_{123} = 7.5 \times 10^{-6} \).
- **Charge Conservation**: Charge remains constant in series.
- **Values and Constants**:
  - Total charge \( Q = 7.5 \times 10^{-4} \) coulombs.
  - Voltage across a component \( V_3 = 50 \) volts, calculated using \( Q = CV \).
- **Capacitance Relationships**: Capacitors C12 and C3 have the same capacitance value.
- **Voltage Calculation**:
  - For component \( V_3 = 50 \) volts when \( C_3 = 15 \times 10^{-6} \).
- **Energy Stored**: Electric potential energy calculated as approximately 18.8 millijoules using \( U = Q^2 / 2C \).

The text emphasizes understanding the configuration of components (series or parallel) and how charge conservation applies to capacitors in series, while voltage distribution varies. The explanation is part of a broader instructional session.
