so let's modify the arrays we can create them now by just adding values or strings we can generate
them by either filling them running a little for loop there's all sorts of ways to to generate an
array but let's see once they exist how can we change them we're going to look through a few
functions built-in Julia functions that will change them they come in two varieties basically
one with and one without the exclamation mark that exclamation mark is usually referred to as a bang
and when you add a bang it makes the changes that that function makes to the array it makes it
permanent so let's just create an array we're going to use the collect function through this unit range
i'm not putting a step in so the default step is going to be used which is one so we're just going
to jump one integer at a time we've got a five element column array of 64 bit integers now let's
add a value to the end and there we can use this push exclamation mark or push bang the arguments
that it takes is the array that you want to to act on and the value that you want to add so let's add
that and lo and behold we have a six it's permanent that mod underscore array is now permanently changed
what if i want to add an element at the start of the array well there is the unshift function
and we're going to add a zero there and lo and behold we have zero one two three four five six what if i
want to remove the last element okay let's use pop and mod array and it removes the last value which
was a six and it returns that value let's call mod array again and you can see it is just be zero to five
what if i wanted to remove that first element now we're going to use this shift function so shift is going
to remove the first element unshift will add a first element so it's a bit confusing there you go
it returns what it will remove if i run mod array call mod array again i says one two three four five
let's create a new one called mod underscore ray and we just passed the values 11 12 13 14 and 15
because i want to show you what if we wanted not to add or delete something at the start or the end
but somewhere in the middle so let's choose an index so i'm going to say delete at
mod array comma three so this delete at with a bang so it's a permanent change
on the mod array function please remove index value at index number three julia starts counting from
number one so 11 12 13 13 is going to be removed and it returns for me the full sometimes some of these
functions return the full array sometimes it returns what it removes you just have to watch out
so delete at is going to return for me the new array so what if i wanted to add or to put the value 13
back at position three now it's not as simple as that what is at position number three now if we were
to call mod array now we're going to get 11 12 13 and 14 what is in position number three well it's the 14
and in that place there i want to put a 13 so if i run this what do i get i get 14 back that might be
a bit confusing but what it is returning the splice function is the value that it is removing to make
place for the 13 so it's this 14 that is going to be chucked out because if i call mod array again it's
now 11 12 13 15 now what if i want that 14 back i didn't necessarily want it replaced well then i have
to pass more than one value so replacing the value in position four what is position four it's 11 12 13
it's the 15 so go to splice the mod array position four and add to it this unit range 14 to 15 with an
increment of one and if i do that is this going to say 15 that is what was removed it was spliced there and
the 15 was removed because if i call mod array now it's going to be 11 12 13 14 15 so you've got to be
very careful when when you want to try when you want to add things in the middle of an array or at least
not at the start or the end now let's sort arrays sometimes that's very necessary thing to do
so let's create a 10 element array i'm going to use the rand function in this unit range 10 to 20
inclusive and i want 10 elements back so between the values of 10 and 20 inclusive please give me
10 values at cdo random so there's our 10 element array all of them 64 bit integers in the first
dimension that means a one column i can ask for it to be sorted so i'm just going to use sort and just
a string array i'm not passing any other arguments and that is just going to go in ascending order so
12 12 14 15 all the way up to the 2020 but i did not use a bang i just said sort so if i call string
array again nothing has changed it is still in the order that it was before so if i want to make that
permanent i've just got to use the bang version of the sort function and if i now call str underscore
array it is still sorted so that's a few ways just to modify the common ways to modify an array
array next up we're going to just increase the dimensions or we're just going to have more than
one column or more than one row we're going to talk about matrices
