The text discusses the concept of cosets in group theory, specifically focusing on left and right cosets. It starts by presenting a mystery about why much time is spent on cosets and introduces a key question: when are left and right cosets equal? The answer hinges on whether the subgroup \( H \) is normal.

In an abelian group, where commutativity holds, left and right cosets are always equal. However, even in non-abelian groups, if \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \), then its left and right cosets will be equal. A subgroup \( H \) is considered normal if it is stable under conjugation by elements of \( G \). This means that for any element \( h \in H \) and \( g \in G \), the element \( g h g^{-1} \) remains in \( H \).

The text then outlines a proof to show that when \( H \) is normal, left cosets are equal to right cosets. To prove two sets (cosets) are equal, one must show each set is a subset of the other. For an element \( A \cdot H \) in the left coset, it can be shown there exists some element \( H^* \) such that \( A \cdot H = H^* \cdot A \). This holds because normality ensures that conjugating any element of \( H \) by elements of \( G \) results in an element still within \( H \).

In summary, the equality of left and right cosets is guaranteed when dealing with a normal subgroup due to its stability under conjugation.

The text discusses proving that a particular set forms a subgroup within another group. The process involves demonstrating that both the left and right cosets are subsets of each other, which confirms they are equal.

Here's a summary:

1. **Subgroup Proof Outline**: The goal is to prove one-way inclusion (a subset relation) between two groups or sets using binary operations involving elements \( A \), \( H \), and their inverses.

2. **Subset Relation**: To show that the right coset is a subset of the left coset, it's necessary to find an element in one set that corresponds to an element in another, specifically leveraging group properties such as conjugation.

3. **Conjugation Explanation**: The text explains how conjugation (using elements like \( A^{-1} \) and \( H \)) helps demonstrate equality between the cosets. It clarifies a potential confusion about inverses by showing that rearranging them doesn't affect the validity of the proof due to group properties.

4. **Final Conclusion**: By proving both subset relations (one-way inclusion in each direction), it's concluded that the sets are equal, thereby confirming the subgroup relation under given assumptions.

The text discusses the concept of a normal subgroup in group theory. A normal subgroup \( N \) of a group \( G \) is defined by the property that for every element \( g \in G \), the left coset \( gN \) is equal to the right coset \( Ng \). This implies two scenarios where this equality holds:

1. In an abelian (commutative) group, since all elements commute (\( gh = hg \)), the left and right cosets are trivially equal.
   
2. For non-abelian groups, a subgroup is specifically defined as normal if it satisfies \( gN = Ng \) for every element \( g \) in the group. This equality of left and right cosets underlines why these subgroups are termed "normal."

The text serves to clarify the definition of normal subgroups and highlight the specific conditions (such as commutativity or the subgroup's normality) where the left and right cosets coincide.
