The text discusses the concept of cosets in group theory, specifically focusing on left and right cosets. It starts by presenting a mystery about why much time is spent on cosets and introduces a key question: when are left and right cosets equal? The answer hinges on whether the subgroup \( H \) is normal.

In an abelian group, where commutativity holds, left and right cosets are always equal. However, even in non-abelian groups, if \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \), then its left and right cosets will be equal. A subgroup \( H \) is considered normal if it is stable under conjugation by elements of \( G \). This means that for any element \( h \in H \) and \( g \in G \), the element \( g h g^{-1} \) remains in \( H \).

The text then outlines a proof to show that when \( H \) is normal, left cosets are equal to right cosets. To prove two sets (cosets) are equal, one must show each set is a subset of the other. For an element \( A \cdot H \) in the left coset, it can be shown there exists some element \( H^* \) such that \( A \cdot H = H^* \cdot A \). This holds because normality ensures that conjugating any element of \( H \) by elements of \( G \) results in an element still within \( H \).

In summary, the equality of left and right cosets is guaranteed when dealing with a normal subgroup due to its stability under conjugation.

The text discusses proving that a particular set forms a subgroup within another group. The process involves demonstrating that both the left and right cosets are subsets of each other, which confirms they are equal.

Here's a summary:

1. **Subgroup Proof Outline**: The goal is to prove one-way inclusion (a subset relation) between two groups or sets using binary operations involving elements \( A \), \( H \), and their inverses.

2. **Subset Relation**: To show that the right coset is a subset of the left coset, it's necessary to find an element in one set that corresponds to an element in another, specifically leveraging group properties such as conjugation.

3. **Conjugation Explanation**: The text explains how conjugation (using elements like \( A^{-1} \) and \( H \)) helps demonstrate equality between the cosets. It clarifies a potential confusion about inverses by showing that rearranging them doesn't affect the validity of the proof due to group properties.

4. **Final Conclusion**: By proving both subset relations (one-way inclusion in each direction), it's concluded that the sets are equal, thereby confirming the subgroup relation under given assumptions.

The text discusses the concept of a normal subgroup in group theory. A normal subgroup \( N \) of a group \( G \) is defined by the property that for every element \( g \in G \), the left coset \( gN \) is equal to the right coset \( Ng \). This implies two scenarios where this equality holds:

1. In an abelian (commutative) group, since all elements commute (\( gh = hg \)), the left and right cosets are trivially equal.
   
2. For non-abelian groups, a subgroup is specifically defined as normal if it satisfies \( gN = Ng \) for every element \( g \) in the group. This equality of left and right cosets underlines why these subgroups are termed "normal."

The text serves to clarify the definition of normal subgroups and highlight the specific conditions (such as commutativity or the subgroup's normality) where the left and right cosets coincide.

The text delves into the concept of cosets in group theory, particularly focusing on left and right cosets and their equality under certain conditions. It starts by highlighting a puzzle about why cosets are significant and mentions a scenario where an element \( A \) is considered in relation to a subgroup \( H \). The main question raised is when a left coset (defined as \( A * H \)) equals the right coset (\( H * A \)). In abelian groups, these are equal due to commutativity.

The text introduces the notion of normal subgroups as the specific condition under which left and right cosets of any element \( A \) in a group \( G \) are equal. It defines a normal subgroup \( H \) as one that is stable under conjugation by elements of \( G \). This means for any \( g \in G \), the conjugate \( g * h * g^{-1} \) (where \( h \in H \)) remains within \( H \).

The text then describes how to prove the equality of left and right cosets assuming \( H \) is a normal subgroup. To show that \( A * H = H * A \), it's sufficient to demonstrate two inclusions: every element of the left coset is in the right, and vice versa. For an element \( A * h \in A * H \) (where \( h \in H \)), one can find a corresponding element in the right coset by considering \( (A^{-1} * A) * h = e * h = h \), where \( e \) is the identity element. Due to normality, \( A * h * A^{-1} \in H \). Hence, each left coset member can be represented as an element of a right coset, proving their equality.

Overall, the text explains that for any subgroup \( H \) to make its left and right cosets equal for every group element \( A \), it must be normal.

The text outlines a mathematical proof demonstrating that a set forms a subgroup within another group. The author explains how they would rewrite their approach if certain elements were included in the current framework, specifically mentioning binary operations and subgroups.

1. **Subgroup Proof**: They describe using binary operations involving an element \( H \) to show one direction of subgroup inclusion.
2. **Cosets**: To prove equivalence between right and left cosets, they aim to show that a right coset is a subset of a left coset by finding elements satisfying this condition.
3. **Conjugation**: The proof hinges on the concept of conjugation, where an element \( A \) and its inverse are reinterpreted through another element \( G \). This involves recognizing that \( A^{-1} = A \), leading to expressing the operation as \( G H G^{-1} \).
4. **Conclusion**: By using this approach, they demonstrate mutual subset relationships between the sets involved, thus confirming subgroup status under given assumptions.

The text essentially outlines a proof strategy for establishing subgroup properties through element manipulation and set inclusion.

The text discusses the concept of a normal subgroup in group theory. A normal subgroup is defined by the property that its left and right cosets are equal for any element in the group. This equality can be easily demonstrated using the definition of a normal subgroup.

There are two scenarios where this equality holds:

1. In an abelian group, where commutativity is inherent, the equality of cosets is trivial.
2. More generally, by using the specific properties of a normal subgroup, one can show that left and right cosets are equal without needing commutativity.

The text highlights these points as part of defining what a normal subgroup is and under which conditions cosets are equal.
