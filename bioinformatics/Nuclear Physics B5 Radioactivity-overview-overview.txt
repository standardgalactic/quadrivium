The text presents problems related to nuclear decay, focusing on alpha and beta decays to understand particle emissions:

1. **Radon-220 to Lead-208 Decay:**
   - The transformation from radon-220 to lead-208 involves a change in both atomic and mass numbers.
   - Three alpha particles are emitted to reduce the mass number by 12 (from 220 to 208), which also decreases the atomic number by 6.
   - To adjust for the remaining difference in atomic number, two beta-negative decays occur, increasing the atomic number by 2 from radon's original 86 to lead's 82.
   - **Result:** The decay sequence includes 3 alpha particles and 2 beta-negative particles.

2. **Energy Calculation for Gamma Rays from Uranium-235 Decay:**
   - Using the formula \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength (1.14 x 10^-11 meters), the energy of gamma rays is calculated.
   - The energy is then converted from joules to mega electron volts (MeV).
   - **Result:** Each gamma photon has an energy of approximately 0.109 MeV.

3. **Energy of Anti-Neutrino from Phosphorus-32 Decay:**
   - During the beta-negative decay of phosphorus-32 to sulfur-32, a beta particle and an anti-neutrino are emitted.
   - The difference in atomic masses before and after decay, including the electron's mass, is used to calculate the total energy released.
   - Subtracting the kinetic energy of the beta particle (1.2 MeV) from this total gives the anti-neutrinoâ€™s possible energy as 0.511 MeV.

These examples demonstrate how nuclear decays are analyzed through changes in atomic structure and energy transformations.
