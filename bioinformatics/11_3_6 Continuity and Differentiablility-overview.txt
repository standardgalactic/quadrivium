To solve this problem, letâ€™s break it down step by step.

### Problem Overview

You have a function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \). You need to find:

1. The equation of the tangent plane at the point \((1, 1)\).
2. Prove differentiability from first principles at that point.

### Step 1: Find the Tangent Plane

The formula for the tangent plane to a surface \( z = f(x, y) \) at a point \((x_0, y_0)\) is given by:

\[
z = f(x_0, y_0) + (x - x_0)f_x(x_0, y_0) + (y - y_0)f_y(x_0, y_0)
\]

where \( f_x \) and \( f_y \) are the partial derivatives of \( f \).

#### Calculate Partial Derivatives

- \( f_x(x, y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2 + y^2) = 2x \)
- \( f_y(x, y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(x^2 + y^2) = 2y \)

#### Evaluate at the Point (1, 1)

- \( f(1, 1) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \)
- \( f_x(1, 1) = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( f_y(1, 1) = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)

#### Equation of the Tangent Plane

Substitute these values into the tangent plane formula:

\[
z = 2 + (x - 1) \cdot 2 + (y - 1) \cdot 2
\]

Simplify:

\[
z = 2 + 2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1)
\]
\[
z = 2 + 2x - 2 + 2y - 2
\]
\[
z = 2x + 2y - 2
\]

So, the equation of the tangent plane is:

\[
z = 2x + 2y - 2
\]

### Step 2: Prove Differentiability from First Principles

To prove differentiability at \((1, 1)\), we need to show:

\[
\lim_{(h,k) \to (0,0)} \frac{f(1+h, 1+k) - f(1, 1) - f_x(1, 1)h - f_y(1, 1)k}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}} = 0
\]

#### Calculate \( f(1+h, 1+k) \)

\[
f(1+h, 1+k) = (1+h)^2 + (1+k)^2 = 1 + 2h + h^2 + 1 + 2k + k^2 = 2 + 2h + 2k + h^2 + k^2
\]

#### Substitute into the Limit

The expression becomes:

\[
f(1+h, 1+k) - f(1, 1) - f_x(1, 1)h - f_y(1, 1)k = (2 + 2h + 2k + h^2 + k^2) - 2 - 2h - 2k
\]

Simplify:

\[
= h^2 + k^2
\]

#### Evaluate the Limit

\[
\lim_{(h,k) \to (0,0)} \frac{h^2 + k^2}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\lim_{(h,k) \to (0,0)} \sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = 0
\]

Thus, the function is differentiable at \((1, 1)\).

### Conclusion

The equation of the tangent plane at \((1, 1)\) is \( z = 2x + 2y - 2 \), and we have shown from first principles that \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) is differentiable at this point.
