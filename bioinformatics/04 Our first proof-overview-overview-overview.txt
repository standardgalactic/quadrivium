The text outlines a method for constructing mathematical proofs by using foundational definitions as the basis. It emphasizes starting with agreed-upon definitions, such as those related to set operations, to build logical arguments. The example provided demonstrates proving that \( A_1 - A_2 = A_1 \cap A_2^c \) by showing mutual subset relationships:

1. **Proving Subset Relations**: 
   - Show \( A_1 - A_2 \subseteq A_1 \cap A_2^c \) using the definition of set difference.
   - Demonstrate \( A_1 \cap A_2^c \subseteq A_1 - A_2 \) through definitions of intersection and complement.

This dual demonstration establishes set equality based on mutual subset relations, encapsulated by the principle: if \( f \subseteq g \) and \( g \subseteq f \), then \( f = g \).

Key points include:

- **Utilizing Definitions**: Foundational definitions help construct logical arguments.
- **Proof Construction**: Set expressions are shown as equivalent using these definitions.
- **Logical Flow**: Proofs logically rewrite operations in terms of others, demonstrating equivalence through defined steps.
- **Building on Previous Work**: New proofs add to a "box" of known information, aiding future constructions.
- **Complexity Management**: Managing this knowledge is essential for developing complex arguments from simpler truths.

Overall, the text highlights the critical role of definitions in mathematical reasoning and their utility in building intricate proofs from established principles.
