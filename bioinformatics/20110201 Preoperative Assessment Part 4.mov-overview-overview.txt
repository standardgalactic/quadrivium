The text outlines key aspects of perioperative risk assessment focusing on cardiovascular and pulmonary factors:

### Cardiovascular Risk Assessment:
- The revised cardiac risk index includes elements such as high-risk surgery, ischemic heart disease history, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-requiring diabetes, and serum creatinine levels.
- Beta blockers are noted for reducing mortality in patients with significant cardiovascular risks, especially those over 65 or with coronary artery disease. However, the POISE trial showed increased perioperative morbidity associated with beta blockers. The recommendation is to maintain existing therapy and start it one to two weeks before vascular surgery.

### Pulmonary Risk Assessment:
- Pulmonary complications are more common and severe than cardiovascular ones, impacting long-term outcomes significantly.
- The ASA classification effectively predicts pulmonary risk, particularly for scores of 2 or higher.
- Common pulmonary issues include pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchospasm, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and exacerbation of existing lung disease.

### Key Pulmonary Risk Points:
- A comprehensive approach involves pre-anesthesia evaluation, during intubation, intraoperatively, and postoperatively.
- Screening includes patient history, clinical examination, physical activity tolerance assessment, chest X-rays, and spirometry for symptomatic patients or those with known lung issues.
- Arterial blood gases can identify preoperative hypoxia but are not usually a contraindication to surgery. Renal function and low albumin levels also indicate increased pulmonary risk due to decreased hydrostatic pressure.

### COPD as a Risk Factor:
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant predictor of postoperative complications, with up to 28% affected.
- Spirometry and preoperative optimization using bronchodilators and steroids are crucial for patients with peak flow less than 80%.

### Additional Recommendations:
- Preoperative physiotherapy, incentive spirometry, and lung expansion exercises can help mitigate pulmonary risks.

The summary emphasizes the importance of assessing both cardiovascular and pulmonary risks in surgical patients through specific interventions and evaluations to reduce complications.
