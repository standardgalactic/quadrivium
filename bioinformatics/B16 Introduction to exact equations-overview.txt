The text discusses exact differential equations, which involve expressions of the form \( m(x, y) \, dx + n(x, y) \, dy \). For such an expression to be considered "exact" within a region \( r \) in the \( xy \)-plane, it must correspond to a multivariable function \( f(x, y) \) defined in that region. This means the partial derivative of \( m \) with respect to \( y \) should equal the partial derivative of \( n \) with respect to \( x \). Additionally, both functions \( m \) and \( n \), along with their first partial derivatives, must be continuous within this region.

Understanding exact differentials requires some knowledge of multivariable calculus. The text suggests referring to a multivariable or advanced calculus course for a more in-depth explanation. In simpler terms, if we have a function \( f(x) \) whose partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is \( m \), and another function \( f(x, y) \) whose partial derivative with respect to \( y \) is \( n \), then the differential equation \( m \, dx + n \, dy = 0 \) is exact if certain conditions are met.

An example provided is the differential expression \( dz = y \, dx + x \, dy \). The text implies that working through examples can help clarify the concept even for those not deeply familiar with multivariable calculus. Understanding this topic fully benefits from a background in multivariable calculus.
