Let's do our first example. We've got to write the sum of these two series as a
single series. The first thing that we notice if this n starts at 2, now let's
just have a look. If this n starts at 2 we have 2 minus 2 so we start here with
an x to the power 0 but here we start with an x to the power 1. We don't want
that we want to start at the same power so here we're going to start with an x
to the power 1 and here we start with an x to the power 0. That'll be the first
term in our sequence but we would like to start both at the same and we don't
want to ever want this to be negative. So what I can do is start this at n equals
3 because 3 minus 2 is 1 so this will start there but that means I've got to
take this n equals 2 outside of the summation. So I'm going to have 2, 2
minus 1 c sub 2 x to the power 2 minus 2 plus again this now n equals 3 to
infinity so I've I've taken the first term out and if I now have n n minus 1 c
sub n x to the power n minus 2 plus this n equals 0 to infinity of c sub n x to the
power n plus 1 here I now start at x plus 1 my first term and here I'm going to
start at 3 minus 2 is 1 x to the power 1 so I'm going to start at exactly the
same I'm going to start with exactly the same power but now I've got to
introduce a new variable k and what we're going to do is just to set k equal to
this for for here and k equal to that for there so I'm going to have this k equals n
minus 2 as far as that's concerned and here we're going to have k equals n plus 1
for that in other words n equals n is going to equal k plus 2 and here n is going to
equal k minus 1 k minus 1 so what are we going to have here 2 that's 1 so I'm going
to have 2 times c sub 2 x to the power 0 is just 1 so I'm going to have that plus the sum of
what is n now n is k plus 2 so I'm going to have here k plus 2 equals 3 to infinity n is k plus 2
n minus 1 so it's k plus 2 minus 1 it's k plus 1 c to the power n is k plus 2 x to the power n is k
plus 2 minus 2 so that's just going to be x to the power k and that is how we're getting these two to
start exactly the same and that's how we introduce this k so that these two I want to express that
as k and I want to express that as k and the only way to do that is to do this so here we're going to
have n which is k minus 1 equals 0 to infinity c to the power n is now k minus 1 x to the power n
remember n is k minus 1 plus 1 so that's just a k so I'm going to have 2 times c sub 2 plus
summation notation here I'm going to take that over to the other side so k equals 1 to infinity
of k plus 2 times k plus 1 c k plus 2 x to the power k plus here I'm going to bring that to the other side
so k equals 1 to infinity so these are now the same so I can just rewrite this two now as one
summation c to the power k minus c sub k minus 1 x to the power k so finally I can rewrite this as c sub 2
plus the sum of k equals 1 to infinity I can take x to the power k out as a common denominator I'm going
to have a common factor c sub k plus 2 I'm going to have a k plus 1 a k plus 2 plus here I'm going
to have a c k minus 1 and that is the answer so I've written this summation the sum of two series
as a single series here plus this first term
