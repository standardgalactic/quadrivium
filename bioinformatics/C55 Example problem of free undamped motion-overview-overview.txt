The text outlines a physics problem involving a spring-mass system undergoing simple harmonic motion. Here's a concise summary:

1. **System Setup**: A 10 N weight stretches a spring by 0.5 meters at equilibrium. The mass is then displaced an additional 10 cm downward and released with an initial upward velocity of -5 m/s.

2. **Spring Constant Calculation**: Using Hookeâ€™s Law, the spring constant \( k \) is calculated as 200 N/m.

3. **Mass Calculation**: Given the weight of 10 N and gravitational acceleration \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), the mass \( m \) is determined to be 1 kg.

4. **Equation of Motion**: The motion equation is derived as \( x'' + 200x = 0 \).

5. **General Solution**: The solution involves complex roots leading to:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 \cos(10\sqrt{2}t) + c_2 \sin(10\sqrt{2}t)
   \]

6. **Initial Conditions and Constants**: Using initial conditions \( x(0) = 0.1 \, \text{m} \) and \( x'(0) = -5 \, \text{m/s} \), the constants are found as \( c_1 = 0.1 \) and \( c_2 = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \).

7. **Final Solution**: The position function is:
   \[
   x(t) = 0.1 \cos(10\sqrt{2}t) - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \sin(10\sqrt{2}t)
   \]

8. **Amplitude Consideration**: The amplitude reflects contributions from both displacement and initial velocity, not just the additional 10 cm.

This scenario demonstrates how initial conditions influence the dynamics of a mass-spring system in simple harmonic motion.
