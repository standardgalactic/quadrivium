The text explains how to find the gradient of the function \( f(x, y, z) = xyz \cdot e^{x+y+z} \) at a specific point \( (1, 1, 0) \). The gradient vector consists of partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

### Steps Involved:

1. **Compute the Partial Derivatives:**
   - For \( x \): Using the product rule, the derivative is \( f_x = (yz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} \).
   - For \( y \): The derivative is \( f_y = (xz + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} \).
   - For \( z \): The derivative is \( f_z = (xy + xyz) \cdot e^{x+y+z} \).

2. **Evaluate at the Point \( (1, 1, 0) \):**
   - \( f_x(1, 1, 0) = 0 \)
   - \( f_y(1, 1, 0) = 0 \)
   - \( f_z(1, 1, 0) = e^2 \)

3. **Form the Gradient Vector:**
   - The gradient at \( (1, 1, 0) \) is \(\nabla f(1, 1, 0) = \langle 0, 0, e^2 \rangle\).

### Geometric Interpretation:

The gradient vector indicates the direction of steepest ascent. At the point \( (1, 1, 0) \), it points in the positive \( z \)-direction with a magnitude of \( e^2 \). This means that at this point, the function increases most rapidly along the \( z \)-axis.

The text also touches on the complexity of visualizing these concepts due to the involvement of four dimensions (the three spatial coordinates plus the function value itself), which can be challenging to represent in a human-friendly way. Nonetheless, understanding the gradient helps in grasping how the function changes with respect to each variable.
