The text describes how to use a function in a software tool (likely graphing or data analysis software) to model experimental data and refine predictions. It begins by setting up a linear function \( f(x) = mx + c \), where initially \( m = 1 \) and \( c = 0 \). The user enters several experimental values of \( x \) and corresponding results, plotting them on a graph.

The software then uses the function to fit these data points. By adjusting parameters \( m \) (slope) and \( c \) (intercept), the user can minimize the difference between observed data points and the line defined by \( f(x) = mx + c \). This process involves plotting the residuals (the differences between observed values and predicted values from the model) on a secondary graph. The goal is to adjust \( m \) and \( c \) such that these differences are minimized, ideally aligning with the y-axis at zero.

This minimization approach aims to find the best-fit line for the experimental data, allowing predictions of future outcomes based on the model. The text hints at more advanced techniques (like least squares fitting) used later to refine this process by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, thereby optimizing the model’s accuracy.

The text describes using Desmos to explore and refine mathematical models based on experimental data points. The process starts with defining a linear function \( f(x) = mx + c \), initially set as \( x + 0 \). Experimental data is entered, such as the pairs (1, 0.9), (2, 2.2), (3, 2.8), (4, 4.5), and (5, 5.6).

Desmos plots these points on a graph, showing how well they fit the current linear model \( x + 0 \). The visualization illustrates discrepancies between observed data and the model's predictions.

To analyze errors, another function \( y - f(x) \) is plotted to display vertical differences (errors) from the actual values to the predicted ones. Adjusting the parameters \( m \) and \( c \) in the model helps minimize these errors, bringing them closer to zero—indicating a better fit.

The text hints at an advanced method for refining models by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and the model's predictions, which is related to finding the best-fit line through least squares regression. This approach seeks to optimize \( m \) and \( c \) such that prediction accuracy improves across potential future experiments.
