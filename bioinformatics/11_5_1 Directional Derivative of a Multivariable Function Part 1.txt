Now let's look at a more difficult subject and that is the directional derivatives of this multivariable function.
What do we mean by a directional derivative?
First of all we looked if we had this multivariable curve lying in a three-dimensional space
First of all we looked at the partial derivatives.
Partial derivatives.
And what you'll remember is that that just refers to what happens in the x and the y and the z directions keeping all the others constant.
In other words remember if we made this the z axis, y axis and the x axis.
Remember if we had our three-dimensional curve and we kept x constant that gave us a zy plane.
That then gave us a zy plane and we could see what the rate of change was in that plane.
The rate of change of z with respect to y. Remember that would have given us di f, di y.
And if we kept y constant, we drew some plane here with a constant y.
Then we had the zx plane and we could see the rate of change of z with respect to x.
That would be di f, di x and the same for z.
And if we put all those together, we would have gotten the gradient of x at a certain point.
Remember, if we're talking with n equals 3, that would have been, for us, would have been di f, di x, di f, di y, di f, di z.
That is our gradient, that is our gradient there.
Okay, just the first two. If I had a function f of x equals x squared plus z squared.
Okay, this is going to those first two.
Okay, save for that. No, don't add this one.
But that is what I'm trying to get to. Remember that that was a rate of change.
For instance, if we look at this, the rate of change of z with respect to the positive y axis.
This is, we had a single variable calculus. But what if I wanted to look at what the gradient was,
not in this direction, but in some arbitrary direction.
If I have my curve lying here and I have a tangent plane at a certain point,
if I had a tangent plane at a certain point, at that point I will have a gradient.
In the x direction, in the y direction, in the z direction, I will have this vector.
I will have this vector. And that will tell me the rate of change in these directions.
But what if I'm interested in the rate of change in a completely different direction?
And that is what the directional derivative is. And this is how we write it.
We choose some unit vector. We choose some unit vector.
Now, in certain various ways, e, e, it's more a physics way to write it, I suppose.
What I've chosen here says the partial derivative of x in this specific direction.
So not in the x direction, not in the y direction.
I'm looking for it in a specific, I'm looking for it in a specific direction, e.
And I can, I can, I can call that vector anything.
Say a comma b.
Give me one million comma minus three billion in that direction.
The problem is I need to convert that vector to a unit vector.
And you'll remember from, if you've taken linear algebra, how to do that.
If I convert that to a unit vector, a unit vector is a length of one.
So I'm going to convert this huge vector or minute vector into one with a length of one.
So, if I can reduce that to a length of one, all I'm then interested in is its direction.
So that is going to equal a comma b divided by the norm of a comma b.
That is how I change a vector into a, into a unit vector.
So for instance, if this was three comma one, it was going to equal three comma one.
How to take the norm?
Well, that's the square root of the one squared plus the third square root of the other one squared.
So three squared is nine, plus one is ten.
So that's the square root of ten, which means there's one over the square root of ten.
So it's a scalar times a vector, which is just going to equal three over the square root of ten,
comma one over the square root of ten.
So now I've changed this vector into a unit vector.
Because if I take the norm of this, I'm going to end up with exactly one.
So now I just have its direction.
And what you're trying to say here is that the differential, partial, the partial derivative in this direction,
remember before if I had die f, die x, that was the same as writing die 1, d1, f of x.
That one was for x, two was for y, three was for z, etc, etc.
But now I'm not taking it with respect to x, I'm taking it in this direction, arbitrary direction,
which I have to convert to a unit vector first.
And that's what we get.
Now obviously if you solve problems, you're not going to use the limit definition.
What we're going to have is that the partial derivative in some unit vector direction,
anyone you choose, or is given, equals the following.
It is the gradient of f of x dot product with that unit vector, dot product with that unit vector.
That is the equation that we are going to use.
I'm not going to prove it, you can look at textbooks, it's quite easy, this is quite an easy proof actually.
Anyway, so it is the gradient dot product with f.
Now you'll remember there's another way to do dot products.
The dot product of two vectors, say vector a dot product vector b,
equals the norm of vector a, times the norm of vector b, times the cosine of the angle between,
cosine of the angle between.
Between these two.
Between those two.
Okay, so I could have taken, make this vector a, this gradient.
The unit vector make b, that one.
And now remember what is that?
What is the norm of a unit vector?
It has a length of one.
This disappears because it's just a one.
So it is the norm of this gradient times the cosine of the angle between, between these two.
Between those two.
And remember cosine varies from negative, negative one to one.
So it will have a minimum value.
This partial derivative in that direction will have a minimum value when the cosine equals 180 degrees.
And let's draw, let's draw the cosine.
Remember cosine goes like this.
So that is zero.
That's pi over two.
And that is pi.
So it will have a maximum value of one, where cosine equals zero degrees.
So there's no, the partial derivative and the unit vector is in the same direction.
And obviously if they're in opposite directions, 180 degrees, this will be negative one.
This will be negative one.
So the partial derivative will be the minimum.
And just remember this way of writing it.
Because you might get one or two problems on that.
So if all of this doesn't make much, much sense, which it actually should.
You're just looking at the rate of change in an arbitrary direction that you are given.
As opposed to the gradient which looked at the partial derivatives which was directly in the direction,
fortunately for us, of the three axes or how many ever axes.
But now we're just going to choose some random direction.
You're going to be given a direction as a vector.
You have to convert it to a unit vector.
You get the product product of that with the gradient at that specific point,
at a specific point.
And that gives you the directional derivative in a certain direction.
Let's do an example or two and you'll see how easy it is.
This is fine, so there is.
