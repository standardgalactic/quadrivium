And in the long term management of the patient once is in hospital now, it's an extremely
resource intensive condition of spinal cord injuries.
They need extensive multidisciplinary care and there are so many things to consider.
Thromboembolism is one of the big things, they've got a lot of risk factors, benostasis,
immoralization, hyperagulability and trauma, because it leads to hyperagulability, and they
recommend perfiditis in the form of heparin, profession stockings, etc. for at least three
to six months after the injury.
At that point you can stop, most of the majority of cases of TBD and pulmonary embolism were
reported within the first three to six months, so it's not lifelong.
They suffer from severe postural micro-tension, again due to their inability to host a sympathetic
reaction due to some decrease in blood pressure, so it can lead to loss of consciousness, so
on.
Then there's a phenomenon called autonomatous reflexia, it's also happening in patients
with high T-spine and C-spine levels, where any form of irritation distal to the level of
an injury, and this usually only develops later, like in your more chronic cases, like a distended
bladder or distended bowel or ingrown tonal, any form of irritation that they cannot feel,
causes this autonomic response where they get facial flushing, flushing severe hypertension,
tachycardia, sometimes fever, they can pass up, they can have a fit, they can have a heart attack,
it's actually quite dangerous.
And you should be aware of this when you're treating spine quality patients, and they should
be educated about it, and basically how you treat this is you just remove whatever the
offending thing, once you unblock a block catheter, you give an enema, you cut the tone up.
And then in the acute phase, you also want to maybe lower the blood pressure by using
either in the Philippine or putting the patient in an upright position.
Urinary complications are quite common, and you can imagine they use the bladder and bowel
function, they frequent urinary tract infections, they can be very stricture from gastroization
and quite a few paraplegics end up having chronic renal failure.
So gastrointestinal considerations, and this also starts in your acute phase, as we said,
aspirational gastric confidence is a large cause of death, so you have to put an energy
to support these patients, and then they will have post-traumatic alias, bowel distention,
delay of gastrochemethine, and you also need to protect them against stress ulceration
in the initial phases.
And they will almost invariably suffer from constipation throughout their lives, so it's
important to institute the bowel regime of regular laxia to prevent that.
And then with the logical considerations, there's obviously pressure ulcers, and it's also
a pressure source.
And it's also recommended that the management of this, or the prevention of this source in
can only be stagnation of the spinal cord and two-hour leg long roading.
And then you have to address the psychological issues.
very prone to develop depression, these dual rules, and suicide is obviously a psychological
stress.
And in conclusion, what we can do is we can prevent secondary spinal cord injury, we can prevent
associated complications, and then of course encourage early rehabilitation and address psychological
issues.
We can see a few pictures, but you can't really see them particularly well, so I'm just going
to skip that one.
And this one.
There you can see there's a, between C6 and C7, that is usually, that degree of suffixation
is usually associated with a unique lateral facetroid dislocation.
And then that goes with 40 pounds of traction, you see how much structure it is now.
And this isn't going to reverse the original injury, but it will.
Yes?
I just want to, sorry, I just want to answer on this traction.
Did you see if you attach the points?
Yes.
And then reading the traction, it...
Oh, the points have your walk.
And then it's the same skeletal traction, it's the same...
It's the same...
It's the same...
And you put the patient slightly in the head-up position so that his body weight provides
catheter traction.
And then the same pulley system that they use for simple skeletal traction should also
add a good place.
Then if you're going to do it, I recommend trying to do it in theatre so that you can sedate
the patient, but you can't knock him out because you have to do the thesis neurology.
And then so you can use the Sion.
So I'm going to watch that you see in the fashion picture.
And the work out.
Hey!
I don't want to be done.
What the hell?
