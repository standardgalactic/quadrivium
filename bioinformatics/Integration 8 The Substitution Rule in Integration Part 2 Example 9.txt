In this problem we are asked to evaluate the indefinite integral of two functions that are
multiplied. That's x squared and x cubed over x cubed over 21 minus 1 to the power 6.
What we can see is that a part of of x cubed, a part of its first derivative,
does appear in the other function. So let's go for that. Let u equal x to the power 3 over 21 minus 1.
du dx would thus be 3 over 21 x squared minus 0. So we need the x squared and the dx
on one side. So that's going to give us 21 over 3 du equals x squared dx. Now we can substitute.
So that would be the indefinite integral of, we have u to the power 6 and x squared dx will replace
to the 21 over 3. So that will all be with respect to u. With the constant multiple rule we can bring
out the 21 over 3 indefinite integral of u to the power 6 du. That would be 21 over 3. What is the
antiderivative of u to the power 6? Well if we have u to the power 6 we can add 1 to the power,
which gives us 7. And we'll divide the coefficient of u which was 1 by this new power 7. So that will
leave us times 1 over 7 u to the power 7 plus c because it's indefinite integral. So that would be
7 times c is 21. That would be 21 over 21 u was x to the power 3 over 21 minus 1 all to the power 7 plus c.
But then we could end up with x to the power 10 plus x to the power 2 over 21 minus 1 all to the power 7 plus c
