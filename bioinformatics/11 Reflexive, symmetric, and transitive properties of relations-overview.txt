The text discusses three main properties of binary relations: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

1. **Reflexive Property**: A binary relation on a set \(A\) is reflexive if every element in \(A\) relates to itself. For example, the "divides" relation among numbers (where each number divides itself) and the "greater than or equal to" relation among real numbers are both reflexive.

2. **Symmetric Property**: A binary relation on a set is symmetric if for any elements \(A\) and \(B\), whenever \(A\) relates to \(B\), then \(B\) also relates to \(A\). The text advises checking the direction of relations in textbooks or lectures, as this can vary.

3. **Transitive Property**: A binary relation on a set is transitive if whenever one element relates to a second, and the second relates to a third, then the first element also relates to the third. An example given is the "parallel" relation among lines: if line one is parallel to line two, and line two is parallel to line three, then line one must be parallel to line three.

These properties are fundamental in understanding binary relations in mathematics.
