Here we are still dealing with simplifying fractions before we integrate them.
Once again what we will have here is the P divided by the Q divided by the Q
We note that the degree of P is 2 and the degree of Q is cubed.
So the degree of P is smaller than the degree of Q
But what we note though is that the denominator Q has already been factored out
It can't be simplified any further
But it contains an X that is squared
And if we do this problem now we have to use a different method from what we had seen before
And what we are going to do is the following
On the left hand side we have X squared and X minus 1 and X squared plus 1
So we have two factors in the denominator
So we are certainly going to have on the right hand side we are going to have an A over our X minus 1
Plus, but we can't have B over X squared plus 1 because that X is squared
We have to have a first degree polynomial
If you think about it this way
In actual fact here on this side there is an X0
And here is an X1
So on this side, on the right hand side we will have to have a BX plus C over X squared plus 1
And that X is obviously to the power 1 and our constant C
So this is a first degree polynomial
First degree polynomial
That we have in the numerator
Now first of all we can
Let's try and solve for A
And we thereby multiply both sides by
By X minus 1
If we do that, I am not going to write out all the steps on the left hand side
If we multiply by X minus 1
That will cancel out to the X minus 1 in the denominator
So we are going to have X squared
And we are going to have X squared plus 1
On the right hand side we are going to have just the A
Plus we are going to have a BX plus C
We are going to multiply that with an X minus 1
And we are going to have X squared plus 1
And we are going to have X squared plus 1
In the denominator
Now we can get rid of our term
Our terms with the
We can get rid of our terms with the
With the B
And by letting X equal 1
So let X equal 1
Let's make more space
Move back up
Let's do that
We now have 1 squared
Over 1 squared plus 1
Which is 2
So that's a half
Equal A
And of course if we add
If we substitute a 0 there
A 1
Let X equal 1
If we substitute a 1 there we have 0
And this term multiplies out to be a 0
So we now know that A equals A half
Now that we know that we can find
Go on to find B and C
So we still have
Let's go to a new page
To a new page
We still have X squared
Over X minus 1
And X squared plus 1
We now know
We now know this is equal to
To
Let's just go back
And the minus also
That is going to be A half
Over X1
So that equals A half
Over X minus 1
And we're going to have
And we're going to have
Plus BX plus C
Over X squared plus 2
So we know what that is
Now we need
What we need to do in the next step
Because we have this BX plus C term here
Is not to again
Try and get rid of other factors
The next step that we go to
If we just left with a BX plus C
Is to multiply both sides
With the left hand side denominator
And look what happens when we do that
So we're going to have
X squared left on the side
Equals
We are going to have
We are going to have
The
On the
We're going to have
1 over 2
Now if we multiply both sides
It's only the X squared plus 1
1 that is going to remain
And on this side
We're going to have
A BX plus C
And we're going to have
The X squared plus 1's cancel out
And we're going to be left with
The X minus 1
Now look very carefully
If we just consider
The X squared terms
On the left hand side
The coefficients of the X squared
Is going to be 1
This is X squared equals
The X squared on
X squareds on the right hand side
Are going to be a half
X squared
Which comes from there
And if we multiply
Out these two terms
By each other
We're going to have
Plus
BX squared
So in actual fact
We have
1 equals
A half
Plus B
And that means
B equals
A half
That was just looking at
The X squared terms
Now let's look at
The constant terms only
In other words
Where we have
X zero
Where we have
X zero
On the left hand side
We have no X zero terms
So we have zero
On the left hand side
And on the right hand side
We are
Let me clear these out
So we can see
Clearly what is going on
So
On the
Right hand side
We are going to have
A half
Times one
Which is a half
Plus
We are going to have
A negative C
We are going to have
A negative C
Which we get from
C times
Negative one
And if we solve for that
That means
C is also a half
So if we rewrite out
Our original
Our original
Problem here
We are just going to
Substitute
A with a half
And B with a half
And C with a half
And we have
Factorized
Our initial problem
Which we can now
Integrate
