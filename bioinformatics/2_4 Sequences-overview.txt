Let's analyze the sequence and determine whether it converges or diverges. The sequence in question is:

\[
a_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n + 2}{3n - 1}
\]

We want to find out what happens as \( n \) approaches infinity.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Oscillating Factor:**
   The term \((-1)^n\) oscillates between positive and negative values:
   - When \( n \) is even, \((-1)^n = 1\).
   - When \( n \) is odd, \((-1)^n = -1\).

2. **Rational Expression:**
   Consider the rational expression \(\frac{n + 2}{3n - 1}\). To analyze its behavior as \( n \to \infty \), divide both the numerator and the denominator by \( n \), the largest power of \( n \) in the denominator:

   \[
   \frac{n + 2}{3n - 1} = \frac{\frac{n}{n} + \frac{2}{n}}{\frac{3n}{n} - \frac{1}{n}} = \frac{1 + \frac{2}{n}}{3 - \frac{1}{n}}
   \]

   As \( n \to \infty \), the terms \(\frac{2}{n}\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\) approach 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

   \[
   \frac{1 + 0}{3 - 0} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

3. **Combining Both Parts:**
   The sequence \( a_n \) can now be expressed as:

   \[
   a_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1 + \frac{2}{n}}{3 - \frac{1}{n}}
   \]

   As \( n \to \infty \), this becomes:

   \[
   a_n \approx (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1}{3}
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The sequence oscillates between \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(-\frac{1}{3}\) due to the factor \((-1)^n\). Since it does not settle at a single value, the sequence does not converge.

Therefore, the sequence \( a_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n + 2}{3n - 1} \) **diverges**.

The text explores the behavior of sequences involving limits, particularly when dealing with indeterminate forms and oscillating expressions. Key points include:

1. **Oscillation and Convergence**: An initial sequence oscillates but converges to zero due to a squared term in the denominator, altering its convergence behavior compared to similar sequences without such terms.

2. **L'Hôpital's Rule**: Applied to evaluate limits involving exponential functions. For instance, \( x e^{-x} \) as \( x \to \infty \) is initially an indeterminate form of infinity times zero but can be transformed into a fraction (using \( x / e^x \)) and resolved using L'Hôpital's Rule to show convergence to 0.

3. **Exponential Ratios**: Another example involves the limit of a ratio of exponentials, where differentiation via L'Hôpital's Rule simplifies the expression, demonstrating convergence to zero as \( x \to \infty \).

4. **Power and Exponential Limits**: The text discusses sequences involving powers and exponential terms, illustrating how sequences with bases between 0 and 1 raised to increasing powers tend toward zero.

Overall, the discussion centers on techniques for determining whether sequences converge or diverge, emphasizing transformations that simplify indeterminate forms and leveraging properties of exponentials and limits.

Let's analyze the given sequence and determine whether it converges or diverges as \( n \) approaches infinity. The sequence in question is:

\[
a_n = (-1)^n \frac{n+2}{3n-1}
\]

### Step-by-step Analysis

1. **Oscillating Factor**: 
   - The term \( (-1)^n \) alternates between \( 1 \) and \( -1 \). This means the sequence will oscillate in sign as \( n \) increases.

2. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - Consider the fraction \(\frac{n+2}{3n-1}\).
   - To simplify, divide both the numerator and the denominator by \( n \), the largest power of \( n \) in the denominator:

     \[
     \frac{n+2}{3n-1} = \frac{\frac{n}{n} + \frac{2}{n}}{\frac{3n}{n} - \frac{1}{n}} = \frac{1 + \frac{2}{n}}{3 - \frac{1}{n}}
     \]

3. **Limit of the Fraction**:
   - As \( n \to \infty \), the terms \(\frac{2}{n}\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\) approach 0.
   - Therefore, the fraction simplifies to:

     \[
     \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1 + \frac{2}{n}}{3 - \frac{1}{n}} = \frac{1 + 0}{3 - 0} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

4. **Combining with the Oscillating Factor**:
   - The sequence \( a_n \) becomes:

     \[
     a_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n+2}{3n-1} \approx (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1}{3}
     \]

5. **Conclusion on Convergence or Divergence**:
   - The sequence \( a_n \) oscillates between \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(-\frac{1}{3}\).
   - Since the terms do not approach a single finite limit but instead keep alternating, the sequence does not converge.

### Final Answer

The sequence \( a_n = (-1)^n \frac{n+2}{3n-1} \) **diverges** as \( n \to \infty \) due to its oscillating nature.

The text discusses the convergence or divergence of various sequences using limits. It illustrates how certain manipulations can lead to conclusions about a sequence's behavior:

1. **Oscillating Sequences**: Initially, it considers a sequence that oscillates between positive and negative values. By multiplying such an oscillating term with another sequence tending toward zero (due to squaring in the denominator), the overall limit converges to zero.

2. **Exponential Decay**: A sequence involving \( n^k \cdot e^{-n} \) is analyzed. As \( n \to \infty \), despite initial forms appearing indeterminate (like infinity times 0), using L'Hôpital's Rule shows that such sequences converge to zero due to the exponential decay dominating polynomial growth.

3. **Exponential Ratios**: Another example involves ratios of exponentials, \( e^{nx} / e^{(m-n)x} \). When applied with L'Hôpital's Rule, these also demonstrate convergence to zero when the denominator grows faster than the numerator as \( n \to \infty \).

4. **Multiplicative Limits**: The text provides an example of multiplying two sequences where one tends toward infinity and another towards zero (specifically, a fraction raised to an increasing power). It concludes that if the base of the exponent is between 0 and 1, the sequence converges to zero.

Overall, these examples emphasize how limits are used to determine convergence or divergence, particularly highlighting how exponential decay and certain manipulations can lead to convergence even in seemingly indeterminate forms.
