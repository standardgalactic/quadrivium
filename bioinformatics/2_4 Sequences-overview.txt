Let's analyze the sequence and determine whether it converges or diverges. The sequence in question is:

\[
a_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n + 2}{3n - 1}
\]

We want to find out what happens as \( n \) approaches infinity.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Oscillating Factor:**
   The term \((-1)^n\) oscillates between positive and negative values:
   - When \( n \) is even, \((-1)^n = 1\).
   - When \( n \) is odd, \((-1)^n = -1\).

2. **Rational Expression:**
   Consider the rational expression \(\frac{n + 2}{3n - 1}\). To analyze its behavior as \( n \to \infty \), divide both the numerator and the denominator by \( n \), the largest power of \( n \) in the denominator:

   \[
   \frac{n + 2}{3n - 1} = \frac{\frac{n}{n} + \frac{2}{n}}{\frac{3n}{n} - \frac{1}{n}} = \frac{1 + \frac{2}{n}}{3 - \frac{1}{n}}
   \]

   As \( n \to \infty \), the terms \(\frac{2}{n}\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\) approach 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

   \[
   \frac{1 + 0}{3 - 0} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

3. **Combining Both Parts:**
   The sequence \( a_n \) can now be expressed as:

   \[
   a_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1 + \frac{2}{n}}{3 - \frac{1}{n}}
   \]

   As \( n \to \infty \), this becomes:

   \[
   a_n \approx (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1}{3}
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The sequence oscillates between \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(-\frac{1}{3}\) due to the factor \((-1)^n\). Since it does not settle at a single value, the sequence does not converge.

Therefore, the sequence \( a_n = (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n + 2}{3n - 1} \) **diverges**.

The text explores the behavior of sequences involving limits, particularly when dealing with indeterminate forms and oscillating expressions. Key points include:

1. **Oscillation and Convergence**: An initial sequence oscillates but converges to zero due to a squared term in the denominator, altering its convergence behavior compared to similar sequences without such terms.

2. **L'Hôpital's Rule**: Applied to evaluate limits involving exponential functions. For instance, \( x e^{-x} \) as \( x \to \infty \) is initially an indeterminate form of infinity times zero but can be transformed into a fraction (using \( x / e^x \)) and resolved using L'Hôpital's Rule to show convergence to 0.

3. **Exponential Ratios**: Another example involves the limit of a ratio of exponentials, where differentiation via L'Hôpital's Rule simplifies the expression, demonstrating convergence to zero as \( x \to \infty \).

4. **Power and Exponential Limits**: The text discusses sequences involving powers and exponential terms, illustrating how sequences with bases between 0 and 1 raised to increasing powers tend toward zero.

Overall, the discussion centers on techniques for determining whether sequences converge or diverge, emphasizing transformations that simplify indeterminate forms and leveraging properties of exponentials and limits.
