The text outlines a method for solving systems of linear equations using matrices. It introduces augmented matrices, which combine coefficients and constants from linear equations. The key steps include performing elementary row operations to simplify the matrix into a row echelon form, where solutions are more easily identifiable.

Elementary row operations involve:
1. Locating columns without all zeros.
2. Interchanging rows to bring non-zero elements to the top.
3. Scaling rows to create leading ones.
4. Zeroing out entries below these leading ones by adding multiples of the top row to lower rows.
5. Repeating for sub-matrices.

An example with three equations and unknowns (x, y, z) demonstrates converting these into an augmented matrix and applying operations to simplify it. The goal is to reach a form where back substitution can be used to find solutions.

The reconstructed system from the matrix is:
1. \( x + 2y + 3z = 11 \)
2. \( y + 2z = 5 \) 
3. \( z = 1 \)

Using back substitution, starting with \( z = 1 \), we solve for \( y \):
\[ y + 2(1) = 5 \]
\[ y = 3 \]

Substituting \( y = 3 \) and \( z = 1 \) into the first equation gives:
\[ x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Thus, the solution is confirmed as \( x = 2 \), \( y = 3 \), and \( z = 1 \). This process requires careful execution to ensure accuracy.
