This course introduction focuses on common acute surgical conditions, specifically excluding pediatric surgery due to its unique characteristics. It is designed for students interested in acute care surgery and practicing doctors who frequently encounter such cases. The course emphasizes foundational principles over a comprehensive review and is not meant as a universal guide for all situations. It highlights the importance of combining scientific knowledge with practical experience in medicine. Participants are advised to follow instructor guidance and consult relevant literature. The first lecture will address an acutely inflamed appendix.
