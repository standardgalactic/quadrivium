Let's go through each equation step-by-step to find the solutions:

1. **Equation:** \( x + 1 = 2 \)

   - To isolate \( x \), subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     x + 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 \\
     x = 1
     \]

   - **Solution:** \( x = 1 \)

2. **Equation:** \( 2x = 4 \)

   - To isolate \( x \), divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{4}{2} \\
     x = 2
     \]

   - **Solution:** \( x = 2 \)

3. **Equation:** \( x^2 = 4 \)

   - To solve for \( x \), take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     x = \pm \sqrt{4}
     \]

   - The solutions are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   - **Solutions:** \( x = 2 \) or \( x = -2 \)

4. **Equation:** \( \frac{x}{11} = 33 \)

   - To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 11:
     \[
     x = 33 \times 11 \\
     x = 363
     \]

   - **Solution:** \( x = 363 \)

Each solution is verified by substituting back into the original equation to ensure correctness.

The text is a step-by-step explanation of solving algebraic equations using various mathematical techniques. Hereâ€™s a summarized version:

1. **Simplifying Fractions:**
   - The process starts with an equation involving multiplication and division, leading to simplification via substitution (e.g., \(11 \times 3 = 363\), then dividing by 11 results in 33).
   - An alternative equation setup (\(\frac{11}{x} = 33\)) is used to isolate \(x\) by multiplying both sides by \(x\), canceling out terms, and simplifying the fraction using greatest common divisor (GCD) techniques.

2. **Using Reciprocals:**
   - A subsequent example demonstrates solving for \(x\) in an equation with a coefficient using reciprocals:
     \[
     \frac{5}{4} \times 12 = x
     \]
   - By recognizing and canceling common factors, the solution simplifies to \(x = 15\).

3. **Distributive Property:**
   - A more complex equation is presented, requiring distribution to eliminate parentheses:
     \[
     3(4x + 5(x - 2)) + 6 = 1 - 2(9 - 2(x - 4))
     \]
   - The distributive property simplifies both sides, resulting in terms involving \(x\) and constants.

4. **Combining Like Terms:**
   - After distribution, like terms are combined on each side of the equation to further simplify:
     \[
     27x - 24 = -33 + 4x
     \]

5. **Isolating the Variable:**
   - The final step involves rearranging the equation to isolate \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side and constants to the other.

This explanation covers various algebraic techniques, including simplification, distribution, using reciprocals, and isolating variables to solve equations.

The text describes a step-by-step process for solving algebraic equations by isolating the variable \( x \). Here's a summary:

1. **Equation Simplification and Isolation:**
   - Start with an equation and perform operations on both sides to isolate \( x \).
   - Example 1 involves combining like terms, adding or subtracting constants from both sides, and eventually dividing by the coefficient of \( x \) to solve for it.
   - The final solution is \( x = -\frac{9}{23} \).

2. **Complex Fraction Equation:**
   - In a more complex example, expressions involving fractions are simplified using distribution and finding common denominators.
   - Rewrite each side with the same denominator to combine terms effectively.

3. **Simplifying Fractions:**
   - Use distribution to expand numerators.
   - Adjust fractions by multiplying both numerator and denominator by necessary factors to create a common denominator, allowing for addition or subtraction of terms.

4. **Combining Like Terms:**
   - After achieving a common denominator on each side, combine like terms in the numerators.
   - Simplify the equation further by isolating \( x \) through algebraic manipulation.

5. **Final Steps:**
   - The process involves careful arithmetic and algebra to maintain equality while progressively simplifying the equation until \( x \) is isolated.

The text emphasizes understanding these algebraic techniques, suggesting that mastering such problems equips one with the skills needed for solving similar equations.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of simplifying and solving an algebraic equation. Here is a summary:

1. **Simplification**: 
   - The expression \(3x + 10x\) simplifies to \(13x\).
   - \(-6 + 4\) simplifies to \(-2\).
   - This results in the left-hand side being \(\frac{13x - 2}{4}\).

2. **Right-Hand Side Simplification**:
   - The expression is \(14x + 68\), divided by 8, which becomes \(\frac{14x + 68}{8}\).
   - Distributing a factor of 2 gives \(26x - 4\) on the left and simplifies to \(14x + 68\) over 8.

3. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the denominator, resulting in \(26x - 4 = 14x + 68\).
   - Subtract \(14x\) from both sides: \(12x - 4 = 68\).
   - Add 4 to both sides: \(12x = 72\).
   - Divide by 12: \(x = 6\).

4. **Verification**:
   - Substitute \(x = 6\) back into the original equation to verify that both sides are equal.

5. **Tricks for Solving Equations**:
   - For a fraction \(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}\), multiply both sides by \(bd\) to get \(ad = bc\).
   - This method eliminates the denominators and simplifies solving.
   - Another trick involves eliminating terms: for expressions like \(\frac{e \times f}{b} = \frac{e \times g}{d}\), cross-multiply to simplify.

These steps and tricks help in systematically solving algebraic equations by simplifying expressions and using properties of multiplication and division.

The text discusses algebraic manipulation techniques to simplify equations and solve formulas efficiently. It explains how to use properties like commutative multiplication to cancel terms in both the numerator and denominator of fractions, using an example where \( \frac{f}{b} = \frac{g}{d} \) simplifies by recognizing that multiplying cross-terms yields \( f \cdot d = b \cdot g \). 

An example with linear equations is provided: solving \( 3x - 5 \) and \( x + 3 = \frac{24}{15} \), where the text demonstrates clearing fractions by multiplying through to eliminate denominators, leading to a simplified solution using algebraic steps.

The text also highlights practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios. For instance, solving for the radius \( r \) from the area formula of a circle (\( A = \pi r^2 \)) involves dividing by \( \pi \) and taking square roots to isolate \( r \). 

Furthermore, it touches on data science concepts, specifically calculating population mean (denoted as \( \mu \)), where the mean age of a sample is used to estimate the overall population mean due to practical constraints in collecting complete data. This illustrates how algebraic manipulation extends beyond pure mathematics into applications like statistical analysis. The text emphasizes mastering these techniques for efficient problem-solving and understanding formulas.

The text explains how researchers use sample means as point estimates for population parameters. By taking a representative, unbiased, randomly selected sample from a population, they calculate the mean of a numerical variable to estimate the corresponding parameter in the entire population.

However, since not every member of the population is measured, there is uncertainty around this estimate. To address this, confidence intervals are used. A confidence interval provides an upper and lower bound within which the true population parameter is likely to fall, expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95% confident). The formula for calculating these bounds involves the sample mean (\( \bar{x} \)), the sample standard deviation (\( s \)), the sample size (\( n \)), and a constant (\( c \)) related to the confidence level.

The width of the confidence interval is calculated as twice \( c \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \). If you know this width, along with \( s \) and \( n \), you can solve for \( c \) using algebraic manipulation. This process demonstrates an understanding of statistical concepts and mathematical calculations necessary to determine the confidence interval's bounds accurately. The text emphasizes that knowing how to manipulate these equations is crucial for interpreting statistical data and might be tested in exams.
