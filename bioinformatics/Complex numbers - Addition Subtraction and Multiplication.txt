In the second video in my course on more advanced topics in linear algebra, I talk about
arithmetic with complex numbers. It is very simple to do and is very much like working with real
numbers. When we work with complex vectors and complex matrices, we will use the simple arithmetic
that is covered in this lecture. So grab your pencil and paper and let's do some complex arithmetic.
So what we're going to do now is just do some complex arithmetic and the first thing we're going
to do is scalar complex number multiplication. And so let's start with this scalar complex number,
but we're going to just constrain ourselves a little bit and we're going to say let the scalar
and let's make this scalar k, let that be an element for now only of the real numbers. Later on we'll
look at what happens when we have a complex number so that we multiply two complex numbers with each
other. So let's have this number z, this complex number z that's going to be a plus bi and we now
know real number, real number, imaginary unit i and multiply b by i. This is our complex number and we're
going to define this multiplication k times z that is going to be k times a plus b times i and all we're
going to have here we're just going to have the normal distribution that we learned at school. So
nothing complicated there so we're going to have k times a and we're going to have k times b times i.
And so let's have a little example of that well let's first of all define that so that's going to be
our definition how we multiply a real number by a complex number and so there's our definition so let's
just have a little example and we're just going to say let's do three times four let's do to that five
times i very simple three times four and three times five that's all we're going to have so that's three
times four plus here we have three times five times times i and that's going to be 12 plus 15i.
so really nothing difficult there whatsoever let's go to the addition of complex numbers let's look at
the addition of complex numbers and now we're going to have two complex numbers let's make this one z
we're going to make this be a plus b times i and let's make a second one w is another common variable
that we have when we do talk about complex numbers and let's make this c plus di and now do please remember
the fact that c and d they're both real numbers so if we can define this addition z
plus w that is going to be a plus b times i plus c plus d plus i d times i i should say and now i'm
just going to group all my real parts my imaginary parts so they and the c they are both the real
parts i'm going to put them together that's my real part and i'm going to take out i as a common
factor there so that we have our imaginary part b plus d times i and there's our definition for
complex number addition and you can see very easily there it is just adding the two real parts and
adding the two imaginary parts there's really nothing to it shall we do one of these let's say
three plus four i and i'm going to add to that seven plus three i for instance and that's just
going to equal these two real parts go together go together three plus seven is ten plus it's four
i plus three i so remember it's four i plus three i that's what i'm talking about there and it's the
same as you would to say four x plus three x we we know how to do that or we can take out this common
factor i and then we just left with four plus three and in other words that's a seven i so plus seven i
very simple which reminds me of something because we've always been dealing just with these
plus and plus and plus and plus it's always a positive but what if we want to do negative and
so one little other thing that we can add here let's do let k equal negative one and so if i have
negative one times let's do three plus four i then i'm just going to get negative three negative four i
so certainly we can have negatives in there that's not an issue for us at all because what that allows
us is to do the the subtraction of complex numbers so let's do the subtraction of complex numbers let's
have this definition again we're going to have z equals a plus bi now remember that b is a real number
so it might be negative three so i could have a plus negative three i that'd be negative three i i think
you get what i'm talking about not not particularly difficult so let's have c plus di and all i want
to calculate now is z minus w i'm subtracting w from z so i'm going to have a plus bi and i'm going
to subtract from that the following c plus di and really nothing difficult here you can clearly see
where this is going a plus b times i i'm going to distribute this negative one throughout so that's
going to become negative c and that's going to become negative d times i and all i'm going to do
group together the real and imaginary parts so i'm going to have a minus c that's going to be my new
real part and if i add to that i'm going to have the b minus d b minus d times i so let's say that we
have three plus four i and i'm going to subtract from that seven plus seven i what am i going to get
here i'm going to get three plus four times i minus seven minus seven times i just group these together
it's going to be three minus seven and i add to that four minus seven i four minus seven times i
and i'm going to get three minus seven is negative four and four minus seven is negative three negative
three i as simple as that and what we have to find here is the subtraction of complex numbers
so where shall we put it let's put it right there we've defined the subtraction of complex numbers
so let's do something that's a slightly more fun although you know we do get to add complex numbers
that's a real thing and when we're going to talk about vectors and matrices that's of course what
we're going to do so let's talk about the product of complex numbers here we go the product of complex
numbers so i'm going to have two complex numbers z and w let's make this a plus bi let's make this one
c plus di where all these things a and b and c and d remember they are all members of this
set of real numbers real part imaginary part real part imaginary part two complex variables and i
want to multiply them i want to say z times w and it's going to be nothing other than just
the expansion of what you already know so whenever a plus bi and i'm going to multiply that by c plus di
and guess what we're just going to do this same distribution so i'm going to have
a times c and then a times di and i'm going to have bi times c and bi times di simple simple stuff so
a times c is a c a times di is positive a di yeah i'm going to have i'm just going to put these things
in order because they do commute bic so i'm going to say that's b times c times i and now i'm just have
to be careful i've got b times d so that is b times d there's my b times d but i'm also doing i times
i and i remember what i times i is well that's i squared and remember that's how we defined our complex
our imaginary number i should say and that's negative one so it is b times d i times i is negative one so that
becomes negative bd and now i'm just going to group together the real and imaginary parts so that's
going to be ac minus bd plus i'm just going to group those two take out i as a common factor that's
going to be ad plus bc times i so you've just got to watch out for that i times i which is going to give
you a negative one so that you end up with your negative bd so let's write that right let's put that
down there that's an important definition for us the product of complex numbers let's do a little
bit of an example let's just have let's just have three plus four i and i'm going to be slightly more
difficult let's multiply that by three minus three i okay we're going to have three times three that
equals nine i'm going to have three negative three that gives me negative nine i i'm going to have
four i times three that's positive 12 i and now i've got to be careful four times negative three is
negative 12 but i times i is negative one so that gives me a positive 12. so i'm going to end up with
9 plus 12 for my real part and i can add to that let's do it's a negative 9 and a 12 so let's make 12
minus 9 times i 9 and 12 is 21 and 12 minus 9 that's going to be 3 so plus 3i so just check the
arithmetic there i'm famous for making arithmetical errors and that's why we have computer languages and
calculators because who wants to do arithmetic so check on that one for me but i think you can see
clearly what we do when we do the product of complex numbers so let's move on and i want to talk to you
about something very special and that's called the complex conjugate and the way that we define
that if i have a complex number z there's my variable z and that is a plus bi a real part an
imaginary part i define the complex conjugate let's put it there z with a little bar on top so just a
little bar z bar that is going to be a plus and i'm just going to multiply this b part by negative one
so you know that would just mean z bar in this instance is going to be a minus bi so in practice
what we usually just do you just swap the sign of that imaginary part so a plus 3i a plus bi i should
say it's a complex conjugate is a negative bi and so this is a very important thing so let's do a little
example let's have that z equals 3 plus 3i and that means z bar this complex conjugate well i'm
going to multiply that positive 3 by negative 3 and that gives me 3 minus 3i that's great let's do
another one let's have w equals 4 minus 4i so what's w conjugate going to be well i've got to just
multiply negative 4 by negative 1 that gives me a positive so that's 4 plus 4i can you see that we
always swap that sign in practice that's all we're going to do so if we think about the argand plane
well let's just put a little sticker there all these things that are so important that i want you to
remember that's how we define the complex conjugate right there complex conjugate and so we think about
the argand plane it just really means if i display or think about a complex number complex number as a
vector and so if i have my vector there remember that's going to be my a part component that's my
b component it just literally means we're just reflecting this along this real axis line so i'm
just going to have still have the positive a but now i have the negative a positive a but from the
positive b i'm going to go to the negative b or from negative b i'd go to the positive b so the fact is
if this was my complex number z this one right here that's going to be z bar so it's kind of cool
complex conjugate where can i use the complex conjugate well let's go back to something we've already done
and we looked at the norm of a complex number so let's just remind ourselves very quickly what the
norm of the complex number was so we had this idea if z was equal to a plus bi i had this norm of z
z and remember that was the two bars and that was just this real number that i take the positive
square root of the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared now let's think about
something let's do something very special here i'm just going to write it out so you can see where this
is going i'm going to say let's do the norm of let's do the norm of z but we're going to square the norm
let's square the norm well if i square the norm what am i going to get a squared plus b squared
isn't it i'm squaring the square root so i'm going to get a squared plus b squared now let's do something
crazy let's do something crazy let's multiply z by z bar that's crazy isn't it z times z bar so
what's this going to be a plus bi times what's its complex conjugate well it's going to be a times a
a minus bi and if i do that multiplication what do i get a times a is a squared
and i have a times negative bi that's negative abi positive bi times a that's plus positive bi and
negative abi positive abi those two cancel out and now i'm left with b times negative b that's negative
b squared but i have i times i which is another negative one so that becomes positive b squared so
just do that so that you're comfortable with that and hey look at that we have the fact that
let's get a little genie out we have this nice little thing there let's put it down there
because zz bar is nothing other than let's put it out here that is the norm of this complex number
squared the norm of the complex number squared is equal to the complex number times its complex
conjugate these things commute so i can have them the other way around it doesn't really matter
and then if i take the square root of this so if i take the square root of the complex number times
its complex conjugate then i'm just going to get the norm the length if i want to think of it as a
vector i'm just going to get the length so this is kind of an important and quite interesting if you
think about it and so that would be one use of us thinking about this idea of a complex conjugate
is because i can do these wonderful things instead of calculating this pythagorean theorem as far as
the norm of a complex number is concerned thinking about the length there of that vector from the origin
for any point and remember any point is a point a comma b any point on this plane defines for me the whole
set of complex numbers but i can think of the square at least of the norm as being the product
of a complex number and its complex conjugate as i say or the other way around now that we've
revisited the norm we can also revisit the argument remember the principal argument this angle that we
make now there's a slightly different way to think about it i'm not going to discuss it here but if you
do want to watch the extra videos on using matlab to do these calculations we'll just look at
another way of thinking about this argument where we're going to have a positive argument on this
side so from zero to pi we'll call that a positive angle but as soon as we go beyond pi as far as the
radians this angle is concerned we're going to rather go clockwise and so on this open interval from zero to
pi and we're going to call that a negative angle and that's it i think you know enough of complex numbers
so that we can start thinking about complex vectors which is not this remember this is a complex
number turned into a vector i'm talking about a whole vector of complex numbers and even better
a matrix full of complex numbers that'll be coming up next in this lecture series
