The text provides guidance on solving complex number problems without using calculators, focusing particularly on expressing roots of complex numbers and working with polar forms. Hereâ€™s a summarized explanation:

1. **Finding Roots of Complex Numbers:**
   - Given \( z = 1 + i \), the modulus is calculated as \( |z| = \sqrt{2} \).
   - For finding the square root, use the formula for complex roots: \( z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} \left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right)\right) \).
   - Here, the angle (or argument) \( \theta \) for \( z = 1+i \) is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \).
   - For \( n=2 \), roots are calculated using \( k=0 \) and \( k=1 \), resulting in angles \( \frac{\pi}{8} \) and \( \frac{9\pi}{8} \).

2. **Expressing Roots in Polar Form:**
   - The text emphasizes expressing results in a specific polar form (e.g., 4th roots), using pre-calculated angle values.
   - Recognizing these forms simplifies calculation as you may not need exact trigonometric values.

3. **Complex Number Calculations Using Euler's Formula:**
   - For \( z = 3e^{3} e^{i\pi} \):
     - Convert to polar form \( r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).
     - Here, \( r=3 \), \( \cos\pi=-1 \), and \( \sin\pi=0 \).
     - Result: Real part = -3, Imaginary part = 0.

4. **Complex Conjugates:**
   - For the conjugate of a complex number \( z \):
     - Multiply only the imaginary component by -1.
   - Example: If \( \overline{z} = -3e^{-2\pi i} \), then \( z = -3e^{2\pi i} \).
   - Resulting in real part = -3, Imaginary part = 0.

The text focuses on manual calculation techniques and understanding the transformations between different forms of complex numbers without relying heavily on calculators.
