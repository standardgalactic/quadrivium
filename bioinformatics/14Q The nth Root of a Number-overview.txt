The text provides guidance on solving complex number problems without using calculators, focusing particularly on expressing roots of complex numbers and working with polar forms. Hereâ€™s a summarized explanation:

1. **Finding Roots of Complex Numbers:**
   - Given \( z = 1 + i \), the modulus is calculated as \( |z| = \sqrt{2} \).
   - For finding the square root, use the formula for complex roots: \( z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} \left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right)\right) \).
   - Here, the angle (or argument) \( \theta \) for \( z = 1+i \) is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \).
   - For \( n=2 \), roots are calculated using \( k=0 \) and \( k=1 \), resulting in angles \( \frac{\pi}{8} \) and \( \frac{9\pi}{8} \).

2. **Expressing Roots in Polar Form:**
   - The text emphasizes expressing results in a specific polar form (e.g., 4th roots), using pre-calculated angle values.
   - Recognizing these forms simplifies calculation as you may not need exact trigonometric values.

3. **Complex Number Calculations Using Euler's Formula:**
   - For \( z = 3e^{3} e^{i\pi} \):
     - Convert to polar form \( r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).
     - Here, \( r=3 \), \( \cos\pi=-1 \), and \( \sin\pi=0 \).
     - Result: Real part = -3, Imaginary part = 0.

4. **Complex Conjugates:**
   - For the conjugate of a complex number \( z \):
     - Multiply only the imaginary component by -1.
   - Example: If \( \overline{z} = -3e^{-2\pi i} \), then \( z = -3e^{2\pi i} \).
   - Resulting in real part = -3, Imaginary part = 0.

The text focuses on manual calculation techniques and understanding the transformations between different forms of complex numbers without relying heavily on calculators.

The text provides an explanation of how to solve complex number problems involving roots and polar forms without using calculators. It outlines steps for finding the square root of a complex number \( z = 1 + i \) in polar form:

1. **Modulus Calculation**: The modulus of \( z \) is calculated as \( \sqrt{2} \).
2. **Roots in Polar Form**: For finding roots, it uses the formula \( z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} (\cos(\theta/n + 2k\pi/n) + i \sin(\theta/n + 2k\pi/n)) \), where \( n = 2 \) for square roots.
3. **Angle Calculation**: The angle \( \theta \) is determined to be \( \pi/4 \). For the first root (\( k = 0 \)), it calculates the angle as \( \pi/8 \).
4. **Second Root**: For the second root (\( k = 1 \)), it adds \( \pi \) to the angle, resulting in \( 9\pi/8 \).

The text also covers converting complex numbers between exponential and polar forms:

- Given \( z = 3e^{3 + i\pi} \), it converts to polar form: \( r = 3 \), \( \cos(\pi) = -1 \), \( \sin(\pi) = 0 \). Thus, the real part is \(-3\) and the imaginary part is \(0\).
- For the complex conjugate problem where \( z^* = -3e^{-2\pi i} \), it explains that only the sign of \( i \) changes. Therefore, \( z = -3e^{2\pi i} \), resulting in a real part of \(-3\) and an imaginary part of \(0\).

Overall, the text emphasizes understanding polar forms and transformations without relying on direct trigonometric calculations.
