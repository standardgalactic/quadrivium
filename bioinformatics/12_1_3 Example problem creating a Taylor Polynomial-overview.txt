The text describes how to find the third-order Taylor polynomial for \( f(x) = \sin x \) at the point \( p = \frac{\pi}{4} \). Here's a summary:

1. **Taylor Polynomial Formula**: The general form of a Taylor polynomial is given by:
   \[
   P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(p)}{k!}(x-p)^k
   \]
   where \( f^{(k)}(p) \) is the k-th derivative of \( f \) evaluated at \( p \).

2. **Function and Derivatives**:
   - \( f(x) = \sin x \)
   - First derivative: \( f'(x) = \cos x \)
   - Second derivative: \( f''(x) = -\sin x \)
   - Third derivative: \( f'''(x) = -\cos x \)

3. **Evaluations at \( p = \frac{\pi}{4} \)**:
   - \( f(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
   - \( f'(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
   - \( f''(\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
   - \( f'''(\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)

4. **Constructing the Polynomial**:
   - For \( k=0 \): \( \frac{f(p)}{0!}(x-p)^0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
   - For \( k=1 \): \( \frac{f'(p)}{1!}(x-p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x-\frac{\pi}{4}) \)
   - For \( k=2 \): \( \frac{f''(p)}{2!}(x-p)^2 = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}(x-\frac{\pi}{4})^2 \)
   - For \( k=3 \): \( \frac{f'''(p)}{3!}(x-p)^3 = -\frac{1}{6\sqrt{2}}(x-\frac{\pi}{4})^3 \)

5. **Final Taylor Polynomial**:
   \[
   P_3(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x-\frac{\pi}{4}) - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}(x-\frac{\pi}{4})^2 - \frac{1}{6\sqrt{2}}(x-\frac{\pi}{4})^3
   \]

This is the third-order Taylor polynomial for \( \sin x \) centered at \( p = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The text provides a step-by-step example of deriving the third-order Taylor polynomial for the function \( f(x) = \sin x \) centered at the point \( p = \frac{\pi}{4} \). Here's a summary:

1. **Taylor Polynomial Formula**: The Taylor polynomial is expressed as:
   \[
   P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(p)}{k!} (x-p)^k
   \]
   where \( f^{(k)}(p) \) denotes the k-th derivative of \( f \) evaluated at point \( p \).

2. **Calculations**:
   - For \( k = 0 \): 
     - \( f(x) = \sin x \)
     - At \( x = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( f(p) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
   - For \( k = 1 \):
     - First derivative: \( f'(x) = \cos x \)
     - At \( x = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( f'(p) = \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
   - For \( k = 2 \):
     - Second derivative: \( f''(x) = -\sin x \)
     - At \( x = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( f''(p) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
   - For \( k = 3 \):
     - Third derivative: \( f'''(x) = -\cos x \)
     - At \( x = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( f'''(p) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

3. **Constructing the Polynomial**:
   - Combine these derivatives into the Taylor polynomial formula to get:
     \[
     P_3(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{(x-\frac{\pi}{4})}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{(x-\frac{\pi}{4})^2}{2\sqrt{2}} - \frac{(x-\frac{\pi}{4})^3}{6\sqrt{2}}
     \]

This polynomial approximates \( \sin x \) around the point \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) up to the third degree.
