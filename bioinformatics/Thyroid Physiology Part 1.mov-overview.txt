The text describes the functions and processes involving the thyroid gland, which primarily produces hormones. The main hormones produced by the thyroid are thyroxin (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and calcitonin.

1. **Hormone Production:**
   - Thyroid hormones T4 and T3 are synthesized in follicular cells.
   - Inorganic iodide is absorbed from peripheral breakdown of thyroid hormone and the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream.
   - Iodide is transported against gradients into follicular cells by a transmembrane protein, then moves to the apical cell side and is stored in exocytic vesicles.
   - Inside these vesicles, iodide is oxidized and attached to thyroglobulin to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT), facilitated by a peroxidase enzyme.
   - MIT and DIT molecules combine to produce T3 and T4, which are stored in the follicular colloid.
   - These hormones are later reabsorbed into cells, released into the bloodstream, where 99% bind to circulating proteins.

2. **Calcitonin Production:**
   - Calcitonin is produced by parafollicular C cells of neural crest origin within the thyroid gland.
   - It is secreted in response to high calcium levels and functions primarily to reduce osteoclast activity, thereby decreasing bone resorption of calcium.

The thyroid plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism through hormone production and maintaining calcium balance via calcitonin.
