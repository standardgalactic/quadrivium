In this example, we are asked to get the indefinite integral of 2x over x squared plus 1, that would be to the power negative 1 quarter with respect to x.
Let's rewrite this in a form that might make a little bit more sense for us to decide what to use. Let us say that that would be the indefinite integral of 2x, and that would be x squared plus 1, and that would be to the power negative 1 over 4, all of that with respect to x.
It's now easy to see we have an x squared and its first derivative, which would be 2x.
So, let u be x squared plus 1.
du dx would thus be 2x, and du would be 2x dx.
We simply take the dx to the opposite side.
So, we have a lot of things that we can substitute now.
We have an x squared plus 1, and we have a 2x dx that we can get rid of.
Let's substitute.
So, that is the indefinite integral of u to the power minus 1 over 4 du.
And that is easy to do.
Let's just see on the side here if we have the power minus 1 over 4, and we have to add to that 1.
We raised the power by 1 with the same denominators.
That would be 4 over 4.
So, that would be 3 quarters.
So, we're going to have u to the power 3 quarters.
But, that 3 quarters we are going to divide into the coefficient of u, which is 1.
So, that would be 1 divided by 3 quarters, which is 4 over 3.
So, that is going to give us 4 over 3.
And this is an indefinite integral.
So, plus c.
If we substitute back our value of u, that will be 4 thirds x squared plus 1 to the power 3 over 4 plus c.
