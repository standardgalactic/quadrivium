There we go. It's a new year and let's just do matrix multiplication. We've seen matrix addition
and I very quickly wanted to show you matrix addition so we get away from this systems of
linear equation idea of linear algebra and see matrices as this abstract thing that we can just
manipulate and play with and do really fantastic things with. And today we're going to talk about
matrix multiplication and it's a bizarre thing. There's going to be a little recipe that we follow
to do this which is done without you know much explanation in the beginning. We don't know why
this recipe is chosen but this is the way matrix multiplication works. And I think let's just look
at the sizes of these. Here we have a two by two matrix. Remember two rows, two columns, two rows,
two columns. Let's look at these. Two rows and three columns. Two rows and three columns and here
we have one to three rows and only two columns. So the way matrix multiplication works just as I said
we had with matrix addition that the two has to be of identical dimension. Here something
different happens and it's to do with the way that we do this matrix multiplication.
Let's just look here at the matrix A, B. A and B and we multiply them and we can write A, B or A dot B.
We're going to multiply them in that order. Remember if I were to say six times three. That's six times
three and then you also have by the commutative property three times six. So let's look at this
order. Two times three. A two by three matrix and a three by two matrix. And the only way that you can
multiply matrices just take my word for it now without any explanation is if you put them in this order
it's a two by three and a three by two is if the column count in the first one and the row count in the
second one are identical. It's the only way that you can do matrix multiplication and look at this
commutative property it's the A first and the B second. If the column count here equals the row count there
so these inner ones then you can multiply and the result will be a two by two matrix. So the row count
here and the column count there it'll be two rows and two columns. So if this was a three by three matrix
it would have ended up as a two by three but here it's a two and a two so it's going to end up as a
two by two. I want to show you on paper because remember I hate this paper thing it's not the way the
real world works but got to learn how to do this by hand initially at least I think I want to just
show you a very easy way. And just another thing just think about it I mean if these were part of
a linear system of equations this will be x plus 2y plus minus one and it will be 2x plus 5y
and how do you multiply those things too. So just see these for now as an abstract thing this matrix.
So an easy way to do this is you take the first one and you write it on your piece of paper far away
from anything else. What do we have a one two and a negative one and we're going to have a three one
and a four. So there's neat two little rows and three little columns and I said to you the answer is
going to be a two by two so let's do this there's going to be this two by two solution here that we're
looking for so we've got to fill that in and what we're going to do is there's two columns there there's
two columns there we're going to write that one neatly up here so that's negative two and a five so
that they line up with these two these two line up with those and that's all you need four and a negative
three and a two and a one very simplistic after you've done many of these in your head which you
you shouldn't really have to do because matrices we deal with in your life are enormous and you
know to do that matrix multiplication you're not going to do that on paper you're not going to do
that in your head so learn how this works so that you just get it. Now to get this first one row one
column one you see it very neatly lines up with three elements in this row and three elements in that
column hence those two having to line up now you get it why this needs to happen because this is
the way we define matrix multiplication so there's three elements there there's three elements there
and all we're going to do is pair them up so this one and that negative two this two and that four
this negative one and that two they pair up we just multiply them as this multiplication and then
we just add the three multiplications so one and negative two is negative two plus eight that gives us
six six six minus two gives us four let's see again so that's minus two another minus two so that is
negative four plus eight gives me four so i just multiplied this one by that one the second one by the
second one the third one by the third one those multiplications and i just add them up whether they
be positive or negative values so for this second one it's still if you look at it it's in this row and it's
in that column so we're going to pair up these three elements so that's five minus six is negative one
minus another one gives us negative two
this one is very neatly with a second row in the first column it lines up this way and it lines up
that way so that's negative six plus four is negative two plus eight gives me a six
matrix and the last one that is fifteen fifteen minus three is twelve twelve plus four is sixteen
and there's my solution and lo and behold it's a two by two matrix so you get it very simple to do if
you do it this way because you can see that this one corresponds to this column here and this row here
it's element by element multiplication and you just add up you know what this multiplication is
a negative two plus eight gives me six minus another two gives me four so let's look at this
it's a bit simpler and let's just do a times b let's do it in the same way we're going to have a
times b and that is going to equal let's write it far away a one and a two and a negative one and a three
and here we're going to have the two and the one and the zero and the one so again two elements
here line up with two elements there for this one two a two two a two we see these inner two
this column this row they're the same and the result is going to be a two by two
so let's do this so two times one that's this two two times one is two plus zero
one times one is one plus two is three and we have minus two and we have three
so there we go it's a two by two matrix that is my solution let's just check
negative two for that one negative one three see there's a little mistake
so this this one is this row in that column so that's negative one and that's a three so that's
a two just see that i don't make simple arithmetical edits you get it what i want to do here very
quickly is this what is b times a so by the commutative property let's swap those two around
so now we're going to have the two and the one and the zero and the one and here we're going to have
the one and the two and the negative one and the three let's do that multiplication
so we see for this one here that's two minus one is one it's already different we have four
and three is seven we have zero and negative one that's negative one we have zero and three that's
three look at that a times b does not equal b times a so when it comes to matrix multiplication
for the vast majority of instances the commutative property of multiplication does not hold it really
does not hold second thing you have to remember is you can only multiply certain matrices with each
other so if you see matrix multiplication as some binary operator on some set of elements
that set is only defined under certain circumstances so if i have a set of all different kinds of matrices
the ones that i could multiply here would be ones that at least the row column the row number the
column number and the row number the column of the first one the row number of the second one they have
to be identical otherwise you cannot get a result when you multiply also remember that for the vast
majority of cases the commutative property does not hold let's go to mathematics this i mean matrix
multiplication is a beautiful thing so let's go to mathematics and just have a look and see how easy
that is and you can then well imagine if you have to do some large matrix multiplication large matrices
hundreds of rows hundreds of columns and even larger you're not going to do that behind by hand as
long as you understand this simple principle and you can do a few ones by hand the only mistake you're
going to make a simple little arithmetical errors and we can all make those this is really not difficult
but with these if you write it in this very simplistic way as i showed you the first one of the pair you
right here the second one of the pair there and then these things line up very neatly and it's and it's
so easy to do let's go to mathematical and have a look so here we are in mathematical we are continuing
with us with our matrices we're going to do just look at multiplying two matrices by each other so we have
this binary operation called multiplication and we have two elements from a set set of
certain matrices and we're going to multiply them with each other you'll see these are the ones that
we had on the board a b and then the other a b i'm just going to call them m1 m2 m3 and m4
here in mathematics just just to make things simpler when we do type our code so let's just create these
two matrices so you'll see here there's a number one on this side so the cell was one of those numbered
text cells so here we are just in a normal code cell so i'm going to call it m1 you see the different
color there remember how to create matrices we're going to do them row by row so the first row for
m1 was going to be one comma two comma minus one we close our our curly braces it is a list and it's a
list inside of a bigger list so nested list it's the way that we're going to create them and the second
row is three comma one comma four we close that row and we close the whole we close the whole uh
matrix there i'm going to just hit enter there let's go to m2 and the way we're going to do m2
exactly the same it's just a three uh the three one four uh and the one two negative one three one four
was the first matrix the second one it's going to be let's have a look negative two and five we close that
because it's just two elements in that row second row is four comma negative three close curly brace
the next curly braces and the two comma one and close the whole matrix so negative two and five
four negative three two and one let's just carry on we do all of them m3 let's just do that one it's
one comma two and in the second row we have negative one comma three close and close and then the last one
m4 and it has two comma one and it has zero comma one in the second one i'm going to put a semicolon
there right at the end hold down shift and hit enter or shift and return now see what happened here
the semicolon was just after the second one so unlike other languages which might suppress all of
that output it only suppressed the last one so we can actually see all of the others so if you don't
want it suppressed to the screen remember to put semicolons after each and every one of these rows
let's look at our matrices i'm going to say m1 and i'm going to put it in matrix form i used tab
completion there shift enter shift return and beautiful there one two negative one and three
one four let's look at the dimensions the dimensions of matrix m1 let's have a look at that the dimensions
and we see it's a two by three two rows and three columns just as we had on the board let's look at the
dimensions of m2 and we see it's a three two so we know we can do m1 times m2 but we cannot do
or it is possible now if you look at it the other way around three times two and a two times three
yes we can do that and you'll notice that the solution of that is going to be a three by three
matrix we didn't do on the board we might do it here so let's go ahead and just do that m1 and it's
very simple dot m2 and that dot is just a full stop and let's just put the solution in matrix form
and lo and behold there we have it four negative two six and sixteen just as we had on the board
let's look at what m2 dot m3 is going to be and we'll say put that in matrix form please and there we
see three by two matrix now let's let's have a look at this oh it's not m by m1 let's have a look
at that there we go three by three matrix just as we said if the m2 comes first its column count which
is two must equal the row count of the second one which is m1 and that's two and the result will be
these outside and it's a three by three matrix and you see the solution very well there just to belabor
the point let's do that m3 dot m4 and we put that in matrix matrix form and we see that there and if
we do m4 times m3 and we do that in matrix form we see the solutions are not the same we can even ask
that m3 dot m4 is that equal to remember that's double equal sign that asks the question m4 dot m3
and we see the answer the solution is false it cannot you know it does not commute under these
circumstances one thing we didn't do on the board that i just wanted to show you is just
what happens if we do scalar multiplication so imagine i just had three times three times m3
let's have a look at that and let's put that in matrix form let's say three times m3 and we put
that in matrix form to the screen please and look what happens let's just see what m3 was again so
you can see clearly there it was one two negative one and three and you can see what happens with scalar
multiplication each element in the matrix is multiplied by this scalar whatever the scalar is
so three times one is three three times two is six three times negative one is negative three
and three times three is nine so scalar multiplication is very easy i mean that's that's just easy easy easy
to do so there you go on the board and more importantly in mathematics in a computer using a computer
programming language you can it's so easy to do matrix multiplication
