The text provides an overview of solving second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Equation Form**: The differential equation is given as \( ay'' + by' + cy = 0 \), where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are constants, and \( a \neq 0 \).

2. **Characteristic Solution**: The solution involves finding functions of the form \( e^{mx} \), whose derivatives are constant multiples of themselves.

3. **Auxiliary Equation**: By substituting \( y = e^{mx} \) into the differential equation, we derive the auxiliary (or characteristic) equation: \( am^2 + bm + c = 0 \).

4. **Solving the Quadratic**: The roots \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) of this quadratic equation are found using:
   \[
   m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

5. **Root Types**:
   - **Real and Distinct Roots**: If \( b^2 - 4ac > 0 \), the roots are real and distinct, leading to solutions of the form \( y = C_1 e^{m_1 x} + C_2 e^{m_2 x} \).
   - **Repeated Real Roots**: If \( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \), the roots are real and equal, resulting in a solution like \( y = (C_1 + C_2 x) e^{mx} \).
   - **Complex Conjugate Roots**: If \( b^2 - 4ac < 0 \), the roots are complex conjugates. Using Euler's formula, solutions take the form:
     \[
     y = e^{\alpha x} (C_1 \cos(\beta x) + C_2 \sin(\beta x))
     \]
   where \( m_{1,2} = \alpha \pm i\beta \).

The text emphasizes understanding these forms and applying them to solve differential equations with constant coefficients.

The text discusses solving second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients, specifically those of the form \( ay'' + by' + cy = 0 \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants, and \( a \neq 0 \). The key function for these types of equations is \( e^{mx} \), whose derivatives are constant multiples of itself. By substituting \( y = e^{mx} \) into the differential equation, we derive the auxiliary (or characteristic) equation: 

\[ am^2 + bm + c = 0. \]

This quadratic equation is solved using the quadratic formula:

\[ m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. \]

The solutions \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) determine the form of the general solution to the differential equation, which varies based on the discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac \)):

1. **Real and Distinct Roots** (\( b^2 - 4ac > 0 \)): The solutions are real numbers \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \). The general solution is:
   \[
   y = C_1 e^{m_1 x} + C_2 e^{m_2 x}
   \]
   where \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are constants.

2. **Repeated Real Roots** (\( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \)): The roots are real and equal, \( m_1 = m_2 = -\frac{b}{2a} \). The general solution becomes:
   \[
   y = (C_1 + C_2 x) e^{m_1 x}
   \]

3. **Complex Conjugate Roots** (\( b^2 - 4ac < 0 \)): The roots are complex conjugates, \( m_1 = \alpha + i\beta \) and \( m_2 = \alpha - i\beta \). Using Euler's formula, the general solution is expressed as:
   \[
   y = e^{\alpha x} (C_1 \cos(\beta x) + C_2 \sin(\beta x))
   \]

The text outlines these scenarios and notes that examples will be used to illustrate how to apply these solutions.
