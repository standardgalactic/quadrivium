The text provides an overview of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism risks, emphasizing the importance of prophylaxis due to high incidence rates among hospitalized patients. It briefly mentions pathophysiology involving venostasis, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability but focuses on prevention strategies, which include mechanical methods like stockings and pharmacological agents such as Clexane (enoxaparin) and heparin.

The text also highlights the importance of timing thromboprophylaxis around surgeries and anesthesia to prevent complications like epidural hematomas. Effective communication among healthcare providers is crucial for planning patient care.

Additionally, it discusses considerations for immune-compromised patients, particularly those with HIV or undergoing transplants, who may be affected by drugs that impair liver and renal function. It raises the question of whether surgery will significantly benefit such patients, stressing optimization before procedures.

Nutrition issues are addressed, contrasting morbidly obese patients with malnourished ones, noting serum albumin as a predictor for pulmonary complications. The text debates obesity as an independent risk factor due to its association with post-operative infections and longer ICU stays. It mentions that BMI is used to assess surgical risk, impacting healthcare costs.

Finally, the discussion turns to age-related risks in anesthesia, emphasizing coexisting diseases over age itself. Pain management and psychological considerations like end-of-life care are highlighted as critical for elderly patients. The text concludes with a note of thanks.

The text discusses the importance of understanding and managing risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, especially in hospitalized patients where up to 25% may experience these complications. Prophylaxis is crucial due to the high incidence and potentially fatal first presentations. Screening strategies are limited, but awareness of the "Virtuous Triad" of venostasis, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability helps identify risk factors.

Prophylaxis can be mechanical (e.g., stockings, pneumatic compression) or pharmacological (e.g., antiplatelet agents like heparin). Guidelines such as Geert's provide comprehensive recommendations for prophylactic measures. The timing of thromboprophylaxis in relation to surgery and anesthesia is critical, particularly in orthopedic procedures where regional techniques are used.

The text also highlights the need for careful consideration when treating immune-compromised patients, including those with HIV or malignancies, due to their altered physiological responses and potential drug interactions. Nutritional status is another factor, with serum albumin levels being a significant predictor of pulmonary complications post-surgery.

Obesity is discussed as both an independent risk factor and one associated with other health issues that increase surgical and ICU risks. BMI is used to assess risk levels, influencing costs in private medicine due to increased care requirements.

Age-related physiological reserve decreases the ability to handle stress from surgery and anesthesia, though coexisting diseases are more critical than age alone. Special attention must be given to pain management, psychological considerations, and post-operative care for elderly patients to address quality of life issues effectively. 

Overall, effective communication among healthcare providers is essential to ensure optimal patient outcomes through tailored anesthetic and surgical plans.
