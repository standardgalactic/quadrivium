The text provides an overview of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism risks, emphasizing the importance of prophylaxis due to high incidence rates among hospitalized patients. It briefly mentions pathophysiology involving venostasis, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability but focuses on prevention strategies, which include mechanical methods like stockings and pharmacological agents such as Clexane (enoxaparin) and heparin.

The text also highlights the importance of timing thromboprophylaxis around surgeries and anesthesia to prevent complications like epidural hematomas. Effective communication among healthcare providers is crucial for planning patient care.

Additionally, it discusses considerations for immune-compromised patients, particularly those with HIV or undergoing transplants, who may be affected by drugs that impair liver and renal function. It raises the question of whether surgery will significantly benefit such patients, stressing optimization before procedures.

Nutrition issues are addressed, contrasting morbidly obese patients with malnourished ones, noting serum albumin as a predictor for pulmonary complications. The text debates obesity as an independent risk factor due to its association with post-operative infections and longer ICU stays. It mentions that BMI is used to assess surgical risk, impacting healthcare costs.

Finally, the discussion turns to age-related risks in anesthesia, emphasizing coexisting diseases over age itself. Pain management and psychological considerations like end-of-life care are highlighted as critical for elderly patients. The text concludes with a note of thanks.
