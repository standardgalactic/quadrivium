The text discusses a method for solving an integral involving trigonometric functions using identities. It begins by highlighting difficulties with even powers of sine and cosine, suggesting the use of trigonometric substitutions. A key identity used is:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)
\]

This allows rewriting \(\sin(\theta)\cos^2(\theta)\) as \(\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\theta)\cos(\theta)\). The integral then becomes:

\[
\int \left(\frac{1}{2} \sin(2\theta)\right)^2 \, d\theta
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\int \frac{1}{4} \sin^2(2\theta) \, d\theta
\]

Using the identity for sine squared:

\[
\sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2}
\]

The integral transforms to:

\[
\int \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{1 - \cos(4\theta)}{2}\right) \, d\theta
\]

This further simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{8} \int (1 - \cos(4\theta)) \, d\theta
\]

Breaking it down, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{8} \left(\int 1 \, d\theta - \int \cos(4\theta) \, d\theta\right)
\]

The first part integrates to \(\frac{\theta}{8}\). For the second part, using \(u = 4\theta\) and \(du = 4d\theta\), we have:

\[
\int \cos(4\theta) \, d\theta = \frac{1}{4} \int \cos(u) \, du = \frac{1}{4} \sin(u) = \frac{1}{4} \sin(4\theta)
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{\theta}{8} - \frac{1}{32} \sin(4\theta) + C
\]

This result matches the solution obtained through a different method in a previous discussion.

The text discusses solving a trigonometric integral using trigonometric identities and substitutions. Initially, it highlights a problem involving integrating functions with even powers of sine and cosine. The solution uses the identity \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\), which simplifies \(\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\theta)\).

The problem is transformed into integrating \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\theta)\right)^2\). Expanding this, it becomes the integral of \(\frac{1}{4}\sin^2(2\theta)\). To handle the even power of sine, the identity \(\sin^2(x) = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \cos(2x))\) is applied. This changes the integrand to \(\frac{1}{8} (1 - \cos(4\theta))\).

The integral is then split into two parts: a constant term and a cosine term. The integration of the constant results in \(\frac{\theta}{8}\). For the cosine term, \(u\)-substitution with \(u = 4\theta\) simplifies the integration, leading to an additional term \(-\frac{1}{32} \sin(4\theta)\).

Finally, combining these results gives the indefinite integral as \(\frac{\theta}{8} - \frac{1}{32}\sin(4\theta) + C\), where \(C\) is the constant of integration. This result matches that obtained using a different substitution method discussed in an earlier video.
