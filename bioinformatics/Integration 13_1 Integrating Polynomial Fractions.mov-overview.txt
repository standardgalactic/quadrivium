The text discusses integrating polynomial fractions using partial fraction decomposition. The example provided is the integral of \((x^2 + 2) / ((x - 1)^2 (x + 2))\). 

To use this method, two conditions must be met: 
1. The degree of the numerator must be less than the degree of the denominator.
2. All factors in the denominator should have their variables raised to a power of 1 after factoring.

For integration, the expression is decomposed into simpler fractions:
- \(\frac{a}{x - 1}\)
- \(\frac{b}{(x - 1)^2}\)
- \(\frac{c}{x + 2}\)

The text outlines solving for \(c\) by choosing a value of \(x\) that simplifies the equation. By substituting \(x = -2\), terms involving \(x + 2\) are eliminated, allowing \(c\) to be solved easily.

After finding \(c = \frac{6}{9}\), the focus shifts to solving for \(b\). This involves multiplying both sides by \((x - 1)^2\) to isolate \(b\).

The text provides a step-by-step approach to breaking down and integrating polynomial fractions using partial fraction decomposition.

The text describes a process of simplifying and solving an algebraic expression involving fractions. Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Setup**: The problem involves multiplying by \((x - 1)^2\) and considering expressions like \(x^2 + 2\) over \((x - 1)^2 (x + 2)\).

2. **Simplification Process**:
   - The expression is simplified to \(\frac{a(x-1)^2}{x-1} + b\), allowing the numerator and denominator to cancel out.
   - Further simplification involves solving for constants \(b\) and \(a\).

3. **Solving for \(b\)**:
   - By substituting \(x = 1\), terms involving \((x-1)\) become zero, leading to \(b = 1\).

4. **Simplifying Further**:
   - The expression is further reduced to \(\frac{x^2 + 2}{(x-1)^2(x+2)} = \frac{a}{x-1} + \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{6}{9(x+2)}\).

5. **Solving for \(a\)**:
   - By substituting \(x = 0\), the equation is solved to find \(a = \frac{1}{3}\).

6. **Final Expression**:
   - The fully factored form of the expression is \(\frac{1}{3(x-1)} + \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{6}{9(x+2)}\).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - This simplified and factored expression can now be integrated, completing the problem-solving process.
