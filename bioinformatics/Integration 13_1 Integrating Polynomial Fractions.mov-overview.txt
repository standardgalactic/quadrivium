The text discusses integrating polynomial fractions using partial fraction decomposition. The example provided is the integral of \((x^2 + 2) / ((x - 1)^2 (x + 2))\). 

To use this method, two conditions must be met: 
1. The degree of the numerator must be less than the degree of the denominator.
2. All factors in the denominator should have their variables raised to a power of 1 after factoring.

For integration, the expression is decomposed into simpler fractions:
- \(\frac{a}{x - 1}\)
- \(\frac{b}{(x - 1)^2}\)
- \(\frac{c}{x + 2}\)

The text outlines solving for \(c\) by choosing a value of \(x\) that simplifies the equation. By substituting \(x = -2\), terms involving \(x + 2\) are eliminated, allowing \(c\) to be solved easily.

After finding \(c = \frac{6}{9}\), the focus shifts to solving for \(b\). This involves multiplying both sides by \((x - 1)^2\) to isolate \(b\).

The text provides a step-by-step approach to breaking down and integrating polynomial fractions using partial fraction decomposition.

The text describes a process of simplifying and solving an algebraic expression involving fractions. Here's a summary:

1. **Initial Setup**: The problem involves multiplying by \((x - 1)^2\) and considering expressions like \(x^2 + 2\) over \((x - 1)^2 (x + 2)\).

2. **Simplification Process**:
   - The expression is simplified to \(\frac{a(x-1)^2}{x-1} + b\), allowing the numerator and denominator to cancel out.
   - Further simplification involves solving for constants \(b\) and \(a\).

3. **Solving for \(b\)**:
   - By substituting \(x = 1\), terms involving \((x-1)\) become zero, leading to \(b = 1\).

4. **Simplifying Further**:
   - The expression is further reduced to \(\frac{x^2 + 2}{(x-1)^2(x+2)} = \frac{a}{x-1} + \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{6}{9(x+2)}\).

5. **Solving for \(a\)**:
   - By substituting \(x = 0\), the equation is solved to find \(a = \frac{1}{3}\).

6. **Final Expression**:
   - The fully factored form of the expression is \(\frac{1}{3(x-1)} + \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{6}{9(x+2)}\).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - This simplified and factored expression can now be integrated, completing the problem-solving process.

The text provides an explanation of how to integrate polynomial fractions, focusing particularly on partial fraction decomposition. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Introduction**: The section begins with the goal of integrating a given polynomial fraction, specifically \(\frac{x^2 + 2}{(x - 1)^2 (x + 2)}\). 

2. **Conditions for Partial Fraction Decomposition**:
   - The degree of the numerator must be less than the degree of the denominator.
   - After factoring out the denominator, each factor should have a maximum power of 1.

3. **Rewriting the Expression**: 
   - The fraction is rewritten using partial fractions: \(\frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{B}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{C}{x+2}\).
   - The goal is to determine constants \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).

4. **Solving for Constants**:
   - To find \(C\), multiply through by the denominator containing \(C\) (i.e., \(x+2\)) and set \(x = -2\) to simplify calculations, resulting in \(C = \frac{6}{9}\).
   - The process involves substituting specific values of \(x\) that simplify the equation, allowing for isolation and calculation of each constant.

5. **Example and Explanation**:
   - An example is provided to illustrate breaking down a fraction like \(\frac{7}{16}\) into simpler fractions with powers of 2 in the denominator.
   - This analogy helps clarify how partial fractions are derived by decomposing the original polynomial fraction.

Overall, the text outlines the method for integrating polynomial fractions through partial fraction decomposition, emphasizing conditions and steps to determine the constants needed for integration.

The text describes a process of simplifying and solving a rational expression by multiplying, substituting values for variables, and ultimately determining constants. The steps are as follows:

1. Start with the expression \((x-1)^2\) multiplied on both sides by \(x+2\).

2. Transform the original problem into a form where terms can cancel out due to common factors in the numerator and denominator.

3. By letting \(x = 1\), simplify the equation, solve for constant \(b\), finding that \(b = 1\).

4. Further simplify using another substitution (\(x = 0\)) to solve for constant \(a\), determining that \(a = \frac{1}{3}\).

5. With \(a\) and \(b\) known, restate the problem as a completely factored expression.

6. The final result is:
   \[
   \frac{x^2 + 2}{(x-1)^2(x+2)} = \frac{1}{3(x-1)} + \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{2}{3(x+2)}
   \]

7. This factored expression can now be integrated, completing the simplification and solution process.
