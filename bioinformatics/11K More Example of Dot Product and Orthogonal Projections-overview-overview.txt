The text provides an overview of orthogonal projections and finding vector components relative to other vectors. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Orthogonal Projections**:
   - The objective is to determine the component of a vector \( \mathbf{u} \) that is orthogonal to another vector \( \mathbf{a} \), denoted as \( \mathbf{w}_2 \).
   - This projection is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \mathbf{w}_2 = \mathbf{u} - \left( \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\|\mathbf{a}\|^2} \right) \mathbf{a}
     \]
   - It involves removing the projection of \( \mathbf{u} \) onto \( \mathbf{a} \) from \( \mathbf{u} \).

2. **Example Calculation**:
   - For vectors \( \mathbf{u} = (1, 0, 0) \) and \( \mathbf{a} = (4, 3, 8) \), the dot product is \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 4 \).
   - The squared norm of \( \mathbf{a} \) is calculated as \( 16 + 9 + 64 = 89 \).
   - Plugging these into the projection formula gives:
     \[
     \mathbf{w}_2 = (1, 0, 0) - \left( \frac{4}{89} \right) (4, 3, 8)
     \]
   - Simplifying this results in \( \mathbf{w}_2 = \left(\frac{73}{89}, -\frac{12}{89}, -\frac{32}{89}\right) \).

3. **Orthogonality Check**:
   - To verify if two vectors are orthogonal, compute their dot product. If it equals zero, the vectors are orthogonal.
   - For instance, for vector \( \mathbf{V} = (-3, 4) \), vectors orthogonal to it include \( (-4, -3) \) and \( (4, 3) \).

The text underscores the necessity of accurately applying vector operations, particularly norms and dot products, to address problems involving orthogonality and projections.
