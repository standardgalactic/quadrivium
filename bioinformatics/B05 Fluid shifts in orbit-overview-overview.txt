When an astronaut returns from space and re-enters Earth's gravity, several physiological changes occur to adapt to the new gravitational environment:

1. **Preload Decrease**: Gravity pulls blood towards the lower body, reducing preload (the initial stretching of heart muscle fibers) and decreasing stroke volume to around 70 milliliters per beat or less.

2. **Heart Rate Increase**: To compensate for reduced stroke volume and maintain cardiac output, the heart rate increases.

3. **Blood Pressure Drop and Orthostatic Hypotension**: Blood pressure decreases upon standing due to blood redistribution by gravity, causing orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing).

4. **Hormonal Changes**:
   - **ADH Increase**: Antidiuretic hormone levels rise threefold to conserve water and maintain plasma volume.
   - **Renin and Aldosterone Levels Rise**: Renin activity increases fourfold, leading to a 50% increase in aldosterone, which aids in sodium and water retention.
   - **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Decrease**: This peptide decreases by about a third, reducing its role in promoting fluid excretion.

5. **Fluid Intake and Urinary Output**:
   - Fluid intake increases to meet hydration needs.
   - Urinary output decreases compared to pre-flight levels but remains higher than during the low-output phase of spaceflight.

These adaptations help the body adjust back to Earth's gravity after experiencing microgravity in space.
