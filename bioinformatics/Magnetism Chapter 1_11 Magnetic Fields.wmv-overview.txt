To solve this physics problem involving magnetic dipole moments and torques, let's break down each part step by step.

### Given:
1. **Number of Turns (n):** 1
2. **Radius of the Loop (r):** 15 cm = 0.15 m
3. **Current (i):** 2.6 A
4. **Angle with Magnetic Field (\(\theta\)):** 41 degrees
5. **Magnetic Field (B):** Not specified numerically, but let's assume it's \(B\) for calculation purposes.

### Calculations:

#### 1. Magnitude of the Magnetic Dipole Moment (\(\mu\)):

The magnetic dipole moment \(\mu\) is given by:
\[
\mu = n \cdot i \cdot A
\]
where \(A\) is the area of the loop. For a circular loop, the area \(A\) is:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
A = \pi (0.15)^2 = 0.0706858 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now calculate \(\mu\):
\[
\mu = 1 \cdot 2.6 \cdot 0.0706858 = 0.18378108 \, \text{A}\cdot\text{m}^2
\]

#### 2. Magnitude of the Torque (\(\tau\)):

The torque \(\tau\) on a current loop in a magnetic field is given by:
\[
\tau = \mu B \sin(\theta)
\]

Substitute the known values (assuming \(B\) is provided):
\[
\tau = 0.18378108 \cdot B \cdot \sin(41^\circ)
\]

Calculate \(\sin(41^\circ)\):
\[
\sin(41^\circ) \approx 0.6561
\]

Thus, the torque becomes:
\[
\tau = 0.18378108 \cdot B \cdot 0.6561
\]
\[
\tau \approx 0.1205 \cdot B \, \text{N}\cdot\text{m}
\]

### Conclusion:

- **Magnetic Dipole Moment (\(\mu\)):** \(0.1838 \, \text{A}\cdot\text{m}^2\) (rounded to four decimal places)
- **Torque (\(\tau\)):** \(0.1205 \cdot B \, \text{N}\cdot\text{m}\) (dependent on the magnetic field strength \(B\))

To find the exact torque, you would need the numerical value of the magnetic field \(B\).

To solve the problems presented in your scenario, let's break down each part step-by-step:

### Magnetic Dipole Moment

The magnetic dipole moment (\(\mu\)) of a loop carrying current is calculated using the formula:
\[
\mu = n \cdot i \cdot A
\]
where:
- \(n\) is the number of turns (in this case, 1),
- \(i\) is the current (2.6 A),
- \(A\) is the area of the loop.

The area \(A\) of a circular loop with radius \(r\) is given by:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]
Given that the radius \(r\) is 15 cm, which is 0.15 m, we can calculate the area:
\[
A = \pi (0.15)^2 = \pi \times 0.0225 \approx 0.0707 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now, substituting these values into the formula for magnetic dipole moment:
\[
\mu = 1 \cdot 2.6 \cdot 0.0707 \approx 0.1838 \, \text{A}\cdot\text{m}^2
\]

### Magnitude of the Torque

The torque (\(\tau\)) on a current loop in a magnetic field is given by:
\[
\tau = \mu B \sin(\theta)
\]
where:
- \(\mu\) is the magnetic dipole moment (calculated above as 0.1838 A·m²),
- \(B\) is the magnitude of the uniform magnetic field,
- \(\theta\) is the angle between the normal to the loop and the magnetic field (41 degrees).

To find the torque, we need the value of \(B\). Assuming you have this value, plug it into the formula along with the other known values:
\[
\tau = 0.1838 \cdot B \cdot \sin(41^\circ)
\]

Calculate \(\sin(41^\circ)\):
\[
\sin(41^\circ) \approx 0.6561
\]

Thus, the torque becomes:
\[
\tau \approx 0.1838 \cdot B \cdot 0.6561 \approx 0.1205B
\]

Finally, substitute the given value of \(B\) to find the magnitude of the torque.

### Summary

- **Magnetic Dipole Moment**: \(\mu \approx 0.1838 \, \text{A}\cdot\text{m}^2\)
- **Torque**: \(\tau \approx 0.1205B\), where \(B\) is the magnetic field strength.

Make sure to substitute the actual value of \(B\) when available to compute the torque.
