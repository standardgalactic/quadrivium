To solve this physics problem involving magnetic dipole moments and torques, let's break down each part step by step.

### Given:
1. **Number of Turns (n):** 1
2. **Radius of the Loop (r):** 15 cm = 0.15 m
3. **Current (i):** 2.6 A
4. **Angle with Magnetic Field (\(\theta\)):** 41 degrees
5. **Magnetic Field (B):** Not specified numerically, but let's assume it's \(B\) for calculation purposes.

### Calculations:

#### 1. Magnitude of the Magnetic Dipole Moment (\(\mu\)):

The magnetic dipole moment \(\mu\) is given by:
\[
\mu = n \cdot i \cdot A
\]
where \(A\) is the area of the loop. For a circular loop, the area \(A\) is:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
A = \pi (0.15)^2 = 0.0706858 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now calculate \(\mu\):
\[
\mu = 1 \cdot 2.6 \cdot 0.0706858 = 0.18378108 \, \text{A}\cdot\text{m}^2
\]

#### 2. Magnitude of the Torque (\(\tau\)):

The torque \(\tau\) on a current loop in a magnetic field is given by:
\[
\tau = \mu B \sin(\theta)
\]

Substitute the known values (assuming \(B\) is provided):
\[
\tau = 0.18378108 \cdot B \cdot \sin(41^\circ)
\]

Calculate \(\sin(41^\circ)\):
\[
\sin(41^\circ) \approx 0.6561
\]

Thus, the torque becomes:
\[
\tau = 0.18378108 \cdot B \cdot 0.6561
\]
\[
\tau \approx 0.1205 \cdot B \, \text{N}\cdot\text{m}
\]

### Conclusion:

- **Magnetic Dipole Moment (\(\mu\)):** \(0.1838 \, \text{A}\cdot\text{m}^2\) (rounded to four decimal places)
- **Torque (\(\tau\)):** \(0.1205 \cdot B \, \text{N}\cdot\text{m}\) (dependent on the magnetic field strength \(B\))

To find the exact torque, you would need the numerical value of the magnetic field \(B\).
