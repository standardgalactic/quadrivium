The text describes calculating the electric flux through a sphere using Gauss's Theorem (also known as the Divergence Theorem). Here's a concise summary:

1. **Problem Setup**: 
   - Vector field \(\mathbf{F} = \langle x^3, y^3, z^3 \rangle\).
   - Surface \(S\) is a sphere defined by \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\).

2. **Gauss's Theorem Application**:
   - Relates surface integral of \(\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\, dS\) to volume integral of divergence of \(\mathbf{F}\) over the region \(V\).

3. **Divergence Calculation**:
   - Compute \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 3x^2 + 3y^2 + 3z^2 = 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\).
   - On the sphere, \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\), so divergence simplifies to 3.

4. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - Convert to spherical coordinates: 
     - \(x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta\),
     - \(y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta\),
     - \(z = \rho \cos \phi\).
   - Volume element in spherical coordinates: \(dV = \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta\).

5. **Integration**:
   - Integrate over the sphere's volume:
     \[
     \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \int_0^1 3 \rho^2 \cdot \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
     \]
   - Simplifies to:
     \[
     3 \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^\pi \sin \phi \, d\phi \int_0^1 \rho^4 \, d\rho
     \]

6. **Solution**:
   - Evaluate integrals step-by-step:
     - \(\int_0^1 \rho^4 \, d\rho = \frac{1}{5}\),
     - \(\int_0^\pi \sin \phi \, d\phi = 2\),
     - \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\).
   - Combine results: \(3 \times 2\pi \times 2 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{12\pi}{5}\).

The electric flux through the sphere is \(\frac{12\pi}{5}\).

The text describes solving a problem involving calculating the output flux of an electric field \(\mathbf{F} = (x^3, y^3, z^3)\) through a smooth closed surface \(S\), specifically a sphere defined by \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\). To solve this, we employ Gauss's Divergence Theorem, which relates the flux of \(\mathbf{F}\) across \(S\) to the volume integral of the divergence of \(\mathbf{F}\) over the region \(V\) enclosed by \(S\).

### Steps Involved:

1. **Calculate the Divergence**: 
   - The divergence of \(\mathbf{F} = (x^3, y^3, z^3)\) is calculated using:
     \[
     \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^3) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(y^3) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z^3) = 3x^2 + 3y^2 + 3z^2
     \]

2. **Convert to Spherical Coordinates**:
   - Since the surface is a sphere, converting to spherical coordinates simplifies the integration.
   - In spherical coordinates: 
     \[
     x = \rho \sin\phi \cos\theta, \quad y = \rho \sin\phi \sin\theta, \quad z = \rho \cos\phi
     \]
   - The divergence becomes:
     \[
     3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 3\rho^2
     \]

3. **Set Up the Volume Integral**:
   - The volume element in spherical coordinates is \(dV = \rho^2 \sin\phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta\).
   - The integral over the sphere (radius 1) becomes:
     \[
     \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \int_0^1 3\rho^2 \cdot \rho^2 \sin\phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
     \]

4. **Evaluate the Integral**:
   - Integrate with respect to \(\rho\):
     \[
     \int_0^1 3\rho^4 \, d\rho = \left[\frac{3}{5}\rho^5\right]_0^1 = \frac{3}{5}
     \]
   - Integrate with respect to \(\phi\):
     \[
     \int_0^\pi \sin\phi \, d\phi = [-\cos\phi]_0^\pi = 2
     \]
   - Integrate with respect to \(\theta\):
     \[
     \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi
     \]

5. **Combine Results**:
   - The total flux is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 2 \times 2\pi = \frac{12\pi}{5}
     \]

The solution illustrates the use of Gauss's Divergence Theorem and spherical coordinates to compute the flux through a sphere, resulting in \(\frac{12\pi}{5}\).
