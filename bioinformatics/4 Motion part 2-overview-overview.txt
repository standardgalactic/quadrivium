This tutorial outlines a method for calculating position and velocity from an acceleration vector using symbolic mathematics in Python with SymPy. Here's a summary:

1. **Acceleration Vector**: It is time-dependent, defined by components \(a_x(t) = 6t\), \(a_y(t) = 12t + 2\), and \(a_z(t) = e^t\).

2. **Initial Conditions**: The initial velocity at \(t=0\) is \(\mathbf{v}(0) = (2, 0, 1)\). Initial position is unspecified but assumed as input.

3. **Integration Process**:
   - Integrate each acceleration component with respect to time to obtain the velocity vector.
   - The indefinite integrals are:
     \[
     v_x(t) = 3t^2 + C_1, \quad v_y(t) = 6t^2 + 2t + C_2, \quad v_z(t) = e^t + C_3
     \]
   - These integrals include constants of integration (\(C_1\), \(C_2\), \(C_3\)).

4. **Determining Constants**: Use the initial velocity condition to solve for the constants:
   - At \(t=0\), substitute into the velocity equations and equate them to the initial velocity components.
   - Solving gives \(C_1 = 2\), \(C_2 = 0\), and \(C_3 = 0\).

5. **Final Velocity Vector**: With constants determined, the velocity vector is:
   \[
   \mathbf{v}(t) = (3t^2 + 2, 6t^2 + 2t, e^t)
   \]

6. **Position Vector**: The same integration method applies to find the position vector from the velocity vector.

The tutorial highlights understanding indefinite integrals of vectors and using initial conditions to determine constants.
