Good, that's part two, introduction to matrices.
What we're going to do here is solve linear systems using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
Jordan elimination.
So that's both exciting and ultimately boring.
Now, for most of you, if you take a first course in linear algebra,
it's probably going to start with solving linear systems,
systems of linear equations, to use the longer term.
And boy, oh boy, is that boring stuff.
Well, it's exciting in the first hand, but in the end,
it's never something that you're going to do by hand.
You're going to ask a computer to do it.
And it's useful because to gain a deeper understanding of
the mathematical properties of a matrix as a mathematical object,
you need to be able to do Gauss-Jordan elimination,
but type the values into a computer and it spits it out and end of story.
But yeah, you're probably going to have to pass a test or an exam
and you've got to do these.
And listen, there's no substitution for sitting down and doing a bunch of these by hand
or standing up on a board, whatever, you know,
it takes your fancy how you do your, you know, how you do your exercises.
But yeah, exercise here is the key.
You've got to do these, a bunch of these.
And they frustrate you because the tiniest little arithmetical error,
which is very easy to make and, you know,
says nothing about your intelligence or your abilities.
We all make little arithmetical errors and then the whole thing goes pear-shaped.
And then you have to do the whole thing again.
It's just laborious and long.
And I'm going to show you how to do it quick and easy using Julia.
So, you know, if you're doing this for reals, you know,
you're going to just use the code.
If you're practicing these for an exam or test or whatever the situation is,
at least you've got Julia here or Python or the Warframe language or whatever,
just to check your work.
And that's the beauty of what I'm trying to teach you here.
And, of course, in our instance here,
we're using what is a beautiful language called Julia.
So in the Jupyter Notebook, as always,
all these files, of course, on GitHub and links in the description down below.
This is part two of this.
I think it's going to be about nine parts just on matrices,
whereas the first part was just on vectors.
And I did that all just in one go.
Just this, this, what I've created here for matrices,
that's just way too long for one video.
So I'm breaking it up this time around.
So to use Julia, we're going to extend its capabilities
by loading some packages that excellent, wonderful,
you know, salt-of-the-earth type people who sit down
and use their time to develop open source packages.
You know, these are the saints and the heroes of the modern world.
And we've got to thank them for their, you know, their work
and, you know, support them in any way that we can.
And so we can use some of these packages.
One is plots and the other one's called row echelon form.
But to do that, it lives inside of an environment
that I created specifically for this course.
And if I remember, I'll put a link in the description down below
if you want to know how to set up an environment.
Because every project that you work on in Julia,
just create a separate environment for it.
Don't ever work in your base Julia installation.
If that makes no sense, as I said, if I remember,
I'll put the link in the description down below
or just search my videos, you'll find one
about environments inside of Julia.
And then also how to use Pluto notebooks.
I hope I don't repeat all of this
throughout these nine or so videos for this one.
Anyway, I'm creating a computer variable there called file
and I'm assigning that.
Remember equals is not equals as in mathematics.
It's an assignment operator.
And I'm assigning whatever's to the right of it
to whatever's to its left.
So in the left is a computer variable name.
A little name that you secure a piece of memory
in your computer's, a little space in your computer's memory.
And you call it something so that you can retrieve
that information in your computer's RAM.
And what I'm assigning to that is a string object.
And that string is a reference to a file
on my internal drive here on this Mac.
And it does see the whole address to that.
And what we're interested in is the project.toml file
that contains, together with a manifest.toml file,
information about the environment, this Julia environment.
If it makes no sense, as I say,
search my YouTube channel or check the links below.
So from that, we're going to import the PKG,
the Julia package manager.
And in that package manager,
we're going to use the activate file.
So we're going to activate this environment.
So we're just passing this file,
this string to this file,
to this function as an argument.
And then inside of this environment,
I've got at least these three packages.
Linear algebra.
Well, that's built into Julia when you install it.
Then plots, which I've installed.
And then the row echelon.
Row echelon package.
Very neat little package to do
Gauss-Jordan elimination for us.
And you'll see Gauss-Jordan.
Oh, my pronunciation.
Okay.
And because we're using plots,
plots is going to create some very nice looking plots for us.
And I, my personal preference is for the Plotly backend.
Search for Plotly on the internet.
It's a wonderful ecosystem for developing interactive plotting.
That's the one.
But plots, this plots function,
the plots package,
it supports a lot of backends.
The backend is what actually generates
the plot here on your browser.
So I'm going to use the Plotly backend.
So I'm just calling Plotly open close parentheses
after importing the plots function,
the plots library.
So we can use the Plotly function there.
But gr or,
you know, there's a bunch of other backends
that it uses too.
So solving linear systems
or systems of linear equations.
And this is what a system here in equation 1
is a system of linear equations.
So you see there are three equations
and there's three unknowns.
So instead of x, y, and z,
I've just used x sub 1, x sub 2, x sub 3,
it doesn't matter.
Three equations, three unknowns.
And the thing about a linear system,
what makes it a system is
there are values for x1, x2, and x3
that solve all three of those
or how many ever you have simultaneously.
So I'm not just looking for values
for these three variables to solve one of them.
The same set of variables
must solve all three at one time.
So here's an example of one of the solutions.
We see x1 can be 3, x2 can be 2,
and x3 can be 2 as well.
So if I plug those in,
I see it solves 5, 4, 10 on the right-hand sides.
It solves all three of them in one go.
So that's what we're looking for.
And then by the by,
I think I do it in this course is,
you know, if you don't have enough exercise material,
just generate your own.
You know, so you have your coefficients,
the 1, the 3, the negative 2,
the 2, the negative 2, and the 1,
and the 2, 2, 0.
So do that.
Generate some random coefficients
and then plug in a solution that you're looking for
and then get the right-hand side answers
and then just, you know,
hide them with the x1, x2, and x3
or whatever the case may be
and just try to get back to these values 3, 2, 2.
See if you can find them again.
So you can just generate your own homework, basically,
or your own exercises.
You don't need the books ones.
But what are we talking about here?
We've got these linear systems.
We're all familiar with algebra
and this is at school how you're taught
to write these linear equations.
Okay, if there's only two equations,
you're going to write y equals 3 plus x.
But usually in linear algebra,
we bring them all to the one side
and leave the constant on the right-hand side.
So y equals x plus 2 will become
minus x plus y equals 2, basically.
We bring them all to the one side.
But that's algebra then, equation 1.
That's what I'm trying to say.
But what we're going to do in linear algebra,
we're going to just rewrite those three equations
in a very succinct way.
And then a succinct way of writing it
and working with it
is to write it as a matrix.
So just a little reminder
because everything boils down to vectors.
Remember what a vector is.
Here we see the vector 2, 3.
Right up there, the x value is 2,
the y value is 3,
and you can see this is a Plotly generated one
because it's all interactive
when I hover over it
or I can take things away
and I can zoom in
and I can go back home
to see the whole thing.
You'll see later on
we're going to use Plotly.
So this is not a course
on how to generate plots.
I do have videos out
on the use of Plotly
for various languages
because you can use it in Python
and other languages as well.
This is how to generate that.
That's not all that about it.
I just want to remind you
of what a vector is.
So, you know,
it's this values 2, 3
in this instance.
So from 0, 0
it's always a positional vector.
So it starts at 0, 0
and goes to the point
that you're doing.
Because rewriting this equation 1
towards the linear algebra thing
if you think about
what's happening here
it's just this equation 3.
I've taken out the coefficients.
Look there.
1, 2, 2
3, negative 2, 2
negative 2, 1, 0
and there they are.
1, 2, 2
3, negative 2, 2
negative 2, 1, 0
and on the right hand side
5, 4, 10
and I've written them
in a different way.
And the way that
we've written them here
is you'll notice
that there are
four column vectors here.
And that's why
we started with vectors
because everything
comes back to vectors.
So you notice that
there are these
three column vectors.
Now, I've just got to
we're going to do
matrix algebra
how to do algebra
with matrices.
That's coming
but as a sneak peek
that's why
I think I told you before
that in the previous video
that there's some things
you need to know
to work with this
but you need this
you need to know that
there's kind of
chicken and egg thing
going on here.
So before we get
to that proper
I just want to tell you
and actually
it is a reminder
I think we spoke about it
in the
definitely spoke about it
in the video on vectors
the first video in the series
a scalar times a vector
just means you take
that scalar
and you multiply
by each one
of the elements
in the vector.
And so
in equation four
you see what
matrix vector
scalar vector multiplication
is all about.
And that's exactly
what we have here
scalar
times a vector
and if I multiply
this first vector
each element
by x1
I have
1 times x sub 1
2 times x sub 1
2 times x sub 1
and the same there
so if I multiply
all these out
I'm actually just
left with that.
So then
when you see these
for the first time
it's nothing special
nothing special is going on here
we're just rewriting things
in a different language
basically
we're just using
the language of
instead of algebra
we're using the language
of linear algebra.
So
and
now we see something
very beautiful
come out here
I mean this is profound
if you think about it
a system of linear equations
a linear system
is a
combination
of vectors
that's profound
a linear system
if I have a bunch
of equations here
that I need to solve
all at once
is actually
a linear
combination
linear combination
remember that term
I'm just summing up
constant multiples
of vectors
to reach another vector
that's quite interesting
and that's profound
that's what
the crux of this whole matter is
so I've got problem 1 here for you
create a column vector
and multiply it with a scalar
just a little bit of exercise again
so what we've done here
is create a computer variable
called vector underscore 1
and we're assigning to that
whatever's on the right hand side
and on the right hand side
is an array
I've just used
a different way
of creating
an array here
I'm using the reshape function
and the reshape function
takes
in this instance
three arguments
the first argument
is an array of values
1, 2, 3
and I'm saying reshape this
as something that has
three rows
and a single column
and summing with
a single column
that's a column vector
so there's my column vector
three times one
column vector
of 64 bit integers
and in this instance
it said
multiplied by any scalar
so I've multiplied it
by three
so the scalar three
times the vector one
and that's just
each element
is multiplied by three
so from one to three
we go to three, six, nine
one times three is three
two times three is six
three times three is nine
simple as that
this is something
I want to show you
so
in the last step
of
of
of
this language
transformation
or translation
I'm translating things
from the language
of algebra
into the language
of linear algebra
which is basically
means the notation
is
this is the last
way
the last step
now we're not going to
work with this form
just yet
it's coming
but what I have here
instead of writing it
this way
which makes intuitive sense
now
I'm hoping
is this
sort of weird way
I have a matrix
of only the coefficients
then a vector
of the unknowns
and that equals
the vector
of the right hand sides
and
in matrix form
this is A
this is my matrix A
this
bold
so if we look at the code
here
the article
it's
backslash
backslash
math
BF
stands for math
bold face
B
and there's a math
bold face
X
so it doesn't print out
well on the screen
here in Pluto
but that X
is actually
in bold
so if you use
Microsoft Word
and you highlight
something
and you hit the B
little button
to turn it bold
like this equation
one is up here
is bold
and matrix of coefficients
is bold
so what we have here
is so that X and B
must be bold
it just doesn't print out
so nice and boldly
here in LaTeX
but anyway
maybe they'll change it
AX equals B
so I have a matrix
of coefficients
a vector of unknowns
and a vector
of the right hand side
and I can go even
one step further
and create this thing
called an augmented matrix
well let's go in here
I'm going to show you
so it says the augmented matrix
let's make that
bold
by putting
two underscores
before and after
and if we run
that cell
it'll take a while
to run
because they were
all pre-rendered
now augmented matrix
is in bold
okay because I put
matrix of coefficients
there
so that's the matrix
of coefficients
A there
but this is the matrix
the augmented matrix
and what we've done here
is we've just dropped
all superfluous
writing
I don't write
X sub 1's
X sub 2's anymore
I just have the matrix
of coefficients
on the left hand side
here
these 3 by 3 here
and on the right
here
so this becomes
a 3 times 4 matrix
and that's the augmented
matrix
where I include
the coefficients
and the right hand
side
and that's the one
that we're going
to work with
now that's a proper
matrix
and we're going
to do something
to this matrix
to solve our linear
system
we're going to get
back to those results
these ones up here
where were they
3 for X1
2 for X2
2 for X3
we're going to get
back to them
by working
on this augmented
matrix
so you take your
linear system
doesn't matter
how many rows
how many equations
how many unknowns
you write it
as an augmented matrix
and I hope you can
clearly see
it's the coefficients
and the right hand side
some of your lecturers
might even want you
to draw
I hope you can see
the pointer
the mouse pointer
here on the screen
a little line
down here
to separate these two
from each other
because they really
want you to understand
that on the left hand side
is your coefficients
and this last vector
here
column vector
here
is the right hand side
but you needn't do that
as long as you
of course you've got
a brain between your ears
you understand
what's going on here
but if you're forced
to do it
just do it
and what we're going to do
is we're going to do
these three things
what we call
elementary row operations
now the column operations
as well
and they work exactly
the same
but the easiest way
to understand this
and the way that you're
going to be introduced
to it most probably
is to do these row operations
now what I want to show you
just if you scroll
right down to the bottom
and we're not going to
discuss this here
but I've put this little
appendix here at the bottom
and what I'm trying to do
with this appendix
is to show you
that what you did
in algebra class
in school
was exactly
elementary row operations
you just kept it
in the notation
of algebra
you kept it in algebra
and you tried to isolate
one of the unknowns
so that you can
back substitute
but what you did
was really
what we call
elementary row operations
so all the stuff
you did in algebra
the only thing
that we're going to do here
is we're just writing it
in a different way
so it's shorter to write
and we're going to do
these algebraic things
just in a slightly
different way
because it's easier
because we're writing
things in a more succinct way
but all you're doing
in this guise
is the good old fashioned
algebraic manipulation
in solving
more than one
unknown
and more than one equation
that's all you're doing
there's no difference
there's no magic
going on here
that's not
you know
there's nothing untoward
going on here
or some weird thing
it's just
that we're writing
things in a different way
that's all
so read that
appendix there
if you want this
if you want some intuition
or just this
proper feeling
of moving from
having done it
in school algebra form
to doing it
in the linear algebra form
okay
so the three
elementary row operations
that we have
that's what we call them
elementary row operations
are interchanging rows
multiplying a row
by a constant
and adding a constant
multiple of one row
to another
so that first one
is very easy
I mean if you
write a bunch of equations
in a system
you can write them
in any order
you can just swap them around
that doesn't
you know
that's not going to
change anything
the order in which
you write those three
equations there
that doesn't matter
multiply a row
by a constant
now all you're doing
is
if you say
multiply a row
by a constant
all that is
is you're just
multiplying
both sides of an equation
by a constant
if you have an equation
y equals
x plus 2
and you multiply
both sides by 3
it becomes 3y
equals 3x
plus 6
what you do
to the left hand side
you do to the right hand side
and that's what it means
multiply a row
by a constant
so if you've written it
in this very succinct form
of equation 6
this augmented matrix
if I take any one row here
and I multiply
throughout by 3
all you've done
is you've taken
that single equation
and you multiply
both sides by 3
that equation
which is now
represented by a row
hence we call it
elementary row operation
and the row operation
is multiply a row
by a constant
okay
and then the last one
is a bit more
you know
it's probably a bit more
difficult
you're adding a constant
multiple of a row
to another
and that I explain
in the appendix
also I think
quite thoroughly
and think about it
what does an equation
mean
equation means
the left hand side
equals the right hand side
so again
if you have your equation
y equals x plus 2
and you multiply
the left hand side
by 3
you also multiply
the right hand side
by 3
if you added
the 3 to the left hand side
you add 3 to the right hand side
okay
then the thing
is still in equation
still equal on both sides
as long as you do
to the one side
what you do to the other side
now if you have
another equation
of course the left hand side
looks slightly different
from the right hand side
but they're both equal
so I can add
those two different things
which are actually
still the same thing
because they're part of
an equation
left hand side
right hand side
I can add it
separately
to two sides
of another equation
but because those two things
are exactly the same
they're like plus 3
on one side
plus 3 on the other side
even though
this side has x plus 3
and the other side
has 4 on it
whatever
they're still equal
to each other
so I can take
the left hand side
of 1
and add it
to the left hand side
of the other
and the right hand side
of the 1
to the right hand side
of the other
I have not changed
the equation at all
because I'm adding
to both sides
something that is
equal to each other
anyway
so I hope that
made a bit of sense
so add a constant
multiple of one row
to a constant
multiple of another row
so that what I'm saying
is we're going to
take one of the rows
and we're going to
multiply throughout
by a constant
so that means
I'm doing to the
left hand side
is what I'm doing
to the right hand side
and then I'm going
to add it
to another row
so let's go through
an example
and it's going to
make sense
where are we going
to end up
what we want
ultimately
so I'm just going
to show you
what we ultimately
want
we want
this sort of thing
that is
a matrix
in what is called
reduced row echelon
form
so believe you me
we're going to go
from this one
using these three
elementary row operations
to this one
we have these
look at that
we have this sort of
pyramid scheme
going on here
with ones going down
this diagonal
below every leading
and these are called
leading ones
or pivots
we're going to call
them pivots
below them
is all zeros
and above them
is all zeros
but because remember
these are coefficients
and what this
so let's take that
first row for instance
that's going to read
one times x1
plus zero times x2
plus zero times x3
equals x1
so we're going to
have actual values
here
and that means
we can just read it
off
that's going to be
the three solutions
here on the right
hand side
and what I've done
is I've eliminated
in school algebra
that's what you
try to do
you try to eliminate
one of the variables
so that you have
it isolated
so that you can
do back substitution
so this is the
ultimate form
that we're aiming for
so here in equation 8
now this is going
to be slightly difficult
I mean it's probably
best to write this
on a board
or by hand
and record that
and if you really
want me to do that
or do a bunch of them
I'll make it
I mean
it's actually fun
I mean as I say
it's boring and fun
at the same time
one of those weird
things to do these
and I'll make
some of those videos
so this is purely
for your reference
I'm going to go
through it
and I hope
you know
just translates
sort of what's
going on the screen
here
and it being
the static
this is really
more for reading
but I'm going
to go through it
anyway
so let's look
at this one
I'm going to
jump back and forth
look at this
first one
so what we're
trying to do
you see that
leading one there
remember
one of the
things is we can
just rewrite
the three rows
in any order
we want
but one of the
ones we've got
a leading one
there so quite
happy
I'm going to
drop some
tips and tricks
here on you
the most important
one that you
can ever
okay let me
start here
there's not
only one way
to do this
there are many
roads leading
to Rome
when it comes
to elementary
row operations
you can do
this in so
many ways
and you're
still going to
end up
if you don't
do a little
simple little
arithmetical
error along
the way
let's assume
that you
don't
you're going
to end up
at the same
solution
so there are
infinitely many
ways to do
this
one little
tip is
never
never
do fractions
right until
the end
because one
of your
answers might
be a fraction
but don't
introduce fractions
because that
just makes it
ten times
more likely
well that's
just a
thumb suck
value
more likely
to make
an arithmetical
error
so don't
do that
just remember
that tip
whenever you
work with
integers
never ever
delve down
while you're
doing this
to the level
of
of rationals
fractions
okay
so I see
this leading
one
and now
remember
what I want
I want
zeros below
this
so I've
got to
get rid
of that
two
and I've
got to
get rid
of that
two
in
the parlance
of algebra
I'm trying
to isolate
for each
one of
these equations
a single
variable
so that I
can just
read off
the answer
on the
right hand
side
because of
the
coefficients
of the
other
two
are
zero
then
they're
out
the
game
you know
that's what
we're trying
to do
and that's why
we're trying
to get
these two
zeros
so what I
can do
one thing
I can do
is what
I've done
here in
equation
eight
that first
row we've
multiplied out
by negative
two
so let's
look at it
here
I hope you
can see
the mouse
otherwise
this is
going to
be weird
so if I
multiply this
by negative
two
one times
negative
two
is negative
two
three times
negative
two
is negative
six
negative
two times
negative
two is
positive
four
five times
negative
two is
negative
ten
and that's
what we
have
there
so I've
multiplied
that first
row out
by negative
two
so in
effect
remember this
is just
shorthand
notation for
that original
linear system
so I'm
just you know
just a simpler
way of writing
this so I've
multiplied the
left hand side
of the equation
these first
three coefficients
by negative
two
and I've
multiplied the
right hand side
by negative
two
and that's
what I'm
left with
negative
two
negative
six
four
and ten
so I've
done an
elementary
row
operation
I've
multiplied
one of
my rows
out by
constant
now in
the next
step what
I'm going
to do is
I'm going
to add
a constant
multiple
of the
one row
which we've
just done
a constant
multiple
to one
of the
other
rows
and that's
exactly
what we're
doing here
because if
I take
row one
remember these
first three
values
that's the
left hand
side
and as I
said that's
why some
lecturers want
you to draw
a line
there to
remind you
of that
as I said
you've got
a brain
exactly
still the
same
the
negative
two
negative
six
four
equals
the
negative
ten
that's
an
equation
still
and it
still has
a left
hand side
and right
hand side
and they
the same
it's an
equation
so if I
take these
first three
ones on the
left hand
side and I
add it to
the left
hand side
of another
equation
and I
take the
right hand
side and
add that
to the
right hand
side
of another
equation
that equation
to which I'm
doing these
things
that's still
legit
because I've
done to
the left
side what I
do to
the right
hand
side
I've
added
equal
values
to both
sides
even though
they're
written
differently
so if I
do that
remember
the first
coefficient
is x1
so if I
have
negative
two
x1
plus
two
x1
I can
add
those
two
remember
this is
algebra
here
so I
can say
three
x plus
three
x
I can
add
the
x's
because
the
3x
plus
3x
that
equals
6x
because
you can
add
variables
or
unknowns
that
way
so
they're
neatly
written
in
nice
columns
here
so
negative
two
plus
two
before
I
go
there
see
row
number
one
I've
just
jumped
back
to
the
original
form
of
it
so
even
though
I've
changed
it
here
in
equation
two
so
what
I
usually
do
in
paper
is
I
would
write
this
negative
two
negative
six
four
and
negative
ten
on
the
side
here
and
keep
the
one
three
negative
two
five
in
the
original
form
you
can
also
think
of
between
these
two
steps
equation
eight
and
equation
nine
here
I've
multiplied
row
one
by
negative
a
half
if
I
multiply
row
one
by
negative
a
half
I'm
back
to
one
three
negative
two
five
as
it
was
originally
so
I'm
just
doing
two
things
in
one
go
here
because
I'm
lazy
that
way
okay
and
you're
going
to
get
like
do
bunch
of
these
when
you
do
enough
of
these
you're
just
going
to
do
a
lot
of
things
on
each
step
so
aim
for
that
you'll
naturally
end
there
anyway
and
of
course
some
of
you
are
so
clever
you're
going
to
do
that
right
off
the
bat
so
negative
two
plus
two
I
can
do
that
because
they're
both
x
sub
one
that
leaves
me
with
a
zero
the
negative
six
and
negative
two
that leaves
me
with
a
negative
eight
so
I'm
just
jumping
between
equation
eight
and
nine
here
the
four
and
the
one
gives
me
five
and
the
negative
ten
plus
four
gives
me
negative
six
so
I've
added
the
second
row
represents
an
equation
with
three
on
the
left
hand
side
and
one
element
on
the
right
hand
side
and
I've
added
to
its
left
hand
side
exactly
the
same
that
I'm
doing
to
its
right
hand
side
even
though
they're
different
things
but
the
equation
one
here
row
one
there
is
still
an
equation
both
sides
are
the
same
thing
so
it's
all
legit
legitimate
so
now
I'm
also
going
to
do
that
to
row
three
in
one
step
again
because
I'm
lazy
so
negative
two
and
two
is
zero
negative
six
and
two
is
negative
four
four
four
and
zero
is
four
negative
ten
and
ten
is
zero
so
look
I mean
we're
getting
there
at least
now
under
this
leading
one
I've
got
zero
zeros
so
in
equation
two
row
two
and
row
three
here
here
in
equation
nine
I've
just
left
with
two
unknowns
I've
eliminated
x
one
from
both
of
those
okay
let's
try
and
eliminate
this
negative
four
here
and
as I
say
that's
why
there's
many
ways
to
go
about
this
you
can
do
these
in
any
orders
what
we're
trying
to
always
do
though
is
work
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
and
we're
going
to
get
eventually
you'll
see
we get
to
the
bottom
and
then
we
work
our
way
back
up
so
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
get
these
zeros
underneath
so
I'm
very
fortunate
in
this
one
and
of
course
I
designed
it
this
way
so
it's
easy
is
the
zeros
in
one
go
underneath
so
the
next
one
will
be
this
negative
eight
and
it
eventually
must
turn
into
a
one
but
we're
not
going
to
do
that
now
otherwise
we're
going
to
deal
with
fractions
keep
these
whole
numbers
I've
got
to
make
this
negative
four
I've
got
to
turn
that
into
a
into
a
zero
and
one
way
I
can
quickly
see
is
if
I
make
this
an
eight
I
can
add
the
second
row
to
this
third
row
and
negative
eight
plus
positive
eight
is
going
to
leave
me
with
a
zero
so
to
get
this
negative
four
into
a
positive
eight
what
do
I
do
I
multiply
by
negative
two
if
I
take
this
row
three
and
I
multiply
by
negative
two
I'm
left
to
zero
eight
negative
eight
zero
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here
and
now
I'm
going
to
add
row
two
to
row
three
oh
now
I've
got
to
tell
you
this
I
like
to
do
addition
and
many
of
your
lecturers
are
going
to
try
to
make
you
do
subtraction
so
they're
going
to
say
subtract
one
row
from
another
row
and
I
think
that
makes
it
needlessly
difficult
I
don't
like
that
at
all
that
increases
your
likelihood
as far
as far
as I'm
concerned
or
for
me
let's
just
be
mathematical
about
this
there's
one
example
of
for
whom
it
makes
it
more
difficult
I
like
the
addition
but
just
watch
out
so
if
I
take
the
second
and
add
it
to
the
third
now
I
have
0
and
0
is
0
negative
8
and
8
is
0
5
and
negative
8
is
negative
3
and
0
and
negative
6
negative
6
and
0
is
6
and
there
we
go
I
have
under
this
leading
1
I've
got
all
0s
and
this
negative
8
is
not
a
1
yet
but
at
least
under
that
is
a
0
and
look
at
row
number
3
there
boy
oh
boy
we've
eliminated
two
unknowns
we've
only
got
a
single
unknown
left
and
you
know
what
we
can
obviously
just
do
there
is
multiply
that
by
negative
1
over
3
if
I
take
row
3
and
I
multiply
by
negative
1
over
3
I'm
left
with
this
0
0
negative
3
divided
by
negative
3
is
1
negative
3
divided
by
negative
3
is
2
and
I
can
need
a
solution
here
my first
solution
because
it
says
0
times x
sub 1
plus 0
times x
sub 2
plus 1
times x
sub 3
equals 2
in other words
x sub 3
equals 2
I've
already
got
one
solution
and
remember
how we
designed
this
thing
I showed
you
one of
the
solutions
before
and
2
was
the
solution
so I've
eliminated
things
by getting
towards this
reduced row
echelon form
and what we
actually have
here is just
called row
echelon form
so row
echelon means
I've got
starting at
this position
1
1
now I can
go down
a diagonal
there
and
you know
I'll have
values there
they needn't
all be 1
but below
all of those
pivots
so that
1 is a
pivot
negative 8
is a pivot
1 is a
pivot
below each
of them
of course
this last
one doesn't
have anything
below it
but below
the negative
8
there's a
0
below the
1
there's a
0
0
this is
called
row
echelon
form
and the
process
that we
followed
through the
use of
these
elementary
row
operations
is called
Gauss
elimination
it's called
Gauss
elimination
to get it
to this
form
and now
that you
have a
value
you can
actually
just
back
substitute
because
you know
now
what
x sub
3
is
you can
jump
back
to the
world
of
algebra
but that's
not what
we're about
we're going
to continue
with the
linear algebra
thing
and as I
said we're
going to
move back
up
and the
way to
move
back up
is to
start
getting
zeros
above
these
pivots
now that
first one
doesn't have
equation
above it
so that's
not of
concern
but we're
going to
work our
way
in reverse
back up
so
in reverse
meaning this
leading 1
here
I want
to make
that 5
a 0
and that
negative 2
a 0
so how
can we
make that
5 a 0
well we can
take this
row number
3
and we can
multiply it
by negative
5
and then I'll
get and I've
written it here
for you
0 0
negative 5
10
which I'm
now going
to add
to row
number 2
so there
we go
that 0
plus this
0 is 0
negative 8
plus 0
is still
negative 8
the 5
plus the
negative 5
is 0
and the
negative 6
plus negative
10
is negative
16
so I've
got a
0
on top
of it
there
and I
can also
now
quickly see
that row
2 is
looking
very promising
because I've
eliminated
both x1
and x3
and if I
multiply this
by negative
1 over
8
negative
an 8
I get
this
0
1
0
2
and that's
very beautiful
because now
I know
x2
is equal
to 2
0
times x1
plus x2
plus 0
times x3
equals 2
means x2
equals 2
that's a thing
of beauty
and what we need
to do now
is to get rid
of the other
value on top
of this last pivot
that negative 2
and I think you know
how to do that
we're going to take
again row 3
we're going to
multiply it out
by 2
which means we get
0 0 2 4
there is 0 0 2 4
and we're going to
add that to row number 1
so 1 plus 0
is 1
3 times 0
is 3
3 plus 0
is 3
negative 2
plus
positive 2
is 0
and 5 plus 4
is 9
so there we go
we have
we have
a 0 above it
now
but we've still
got these 2
unknowns
x1 and x2
in row number 1
so now we move
to the next pivot up
we're working our way
back up
and above it
we need a 0
as well
and I think you know
how to do that
we're going to take
this row 2
and multiply it out
by negative 3
to get 0
negative 3
0 negative 6
and we add that
to row 1
so 1 plus 0
is 1
negative 3
plus positive 3
is 0
0 plus 0
is 0
and negative 6
plus 9
is 3
and lo and behold
I told you
what we're going to
aim for
we have this
reduced row echelon
form
and on the right
hand side here
this last column vector
and we're going to
get to
it's actually just
four column vectors
but that's a bit later
what we have there
is our solution
x sub 1 is 3
x sub 2 is 2
x sub 1 is 2
x sub 3 is 2
and
I'm just going to go
in reverse
because what we have
now here
is a constant multiple
of a column vector
plus a constant multiple
of another column vector
plus a constant multiple
of a third column vector
equals
the solution
and that's what we have here
if we plug in
x sub 1 is 3
and x sub 2 is 2
and x sub 3 is 2
and we do that
you know
we do the column
we do the
the scalar vector multiplication
and we know how to add
three vectors
we are going to get to
3, 2, 2
and there's something
very deep going on here
which we won't get to now
but I'm pretty sure
you're going to
you know
you know
you're going to know
what I'm talking about
anyway
we'll get to it proper
so I have this constant
multiple of these
three vectors
giving me the solution vector
and that's exactly
what we were after
3, 2, 2
is the solution
that I showed you above
so
we've done the hard work
now as I said
sit on your behind
stand in front of your board
whatever takes your fancy
whatever is comfortable
for you
where you do all these
just create your own
show you how easy it is
to create them
and just solve them
you've got to practice
this over and over
and what now comes
the fun part
what I would call more
in the modern world's reality
not doing it pen and paper
but just writing some code
so in the row echelon
package
.jl package
there's a function called
RREF
reduced row echelon form
is what it stands for
and we just pass
the matrix
and I showed you
how to create a matrix
as an array
we pass it
to the function
RREF
and it spits it out there
we see the reduced row echelon form
and on the right hand side
we see the solutions
x1 is 3
x2 is 2
and x sub 3
is 2 as well
so
it's
you know
the real way
we do it
by using just a line
of computer code
but
if you still have to
pass your test and exams
you just want to
check your work
it's just
as simple as that
now though
you know
just do a bunch of them
get familiar with them
and then from
then I'm past your test
and your exam
and then from there
I'm not going to do this
by hand again
I want to show you
some interesting stuff
though
we had a system
a linear system
a system of linear equations
and 3 equations
and 3 unknowns
that made things very easy
let's add a 4th equation
and see what happens
because this is the source
of all confusion
here
as if you have more unknowns
than equations
or less unknowns
than equations
that's where all the problems
come in
so now I'm just going to
add another one
x sub 1 minus x sub 2
plus 2 times x sub 3
is 5
and that 3, 2, 2
is still a solution
to this one
so
it's still part of
this linear system
but now I've got
4 equations
and 3 unknowns
if you do
Gauss-Jordan elimination
on that
and
instead of doing it
with pencil and paper
or chalkboard
chalk and chalkboard
or whatever
takes your fancy
as I say
if I do that
this is what I'm going
to end up with
this last row
is all zeros
because it's redundant
it didn't add anything
I had 3 unknowns
in a proper system
and I'm just going to
use the word
in quotation marks
here
the proper
in a proper system
if I've got 3 equations
3 unknowns
I only need 3 equations
to solve the system
and
that 4th one
is now redundant
it hasn't added anything
and if you do
Gauss-Jordan elimination
until reduced row echelon form
you're going to get
all zeros
in that extra one
the one that doesn't
add anything
so just remember that
so let's just delve
a little bit deeper
into this idea
of more equations
than unknown
or the other way around
so what you
you know
let's start
and for simplicity's take
I'm going to start
I'm going to stick
to 2 equations
and 2 unknowns
because that just
makes my life easier
and again
as I say
I'm lazy that way
and
I'm going to start
with how you see it
at school
you're going to see
y equals ax plus b
and y equals cx plus d
remember
in linear algebra
we bring all the equations
all the unknowns
on one side
so that's going to
become ax minus y
equals negative b
and as I write
cx minus y
equals minus d
and we write
the coefficients
as an augmented matrix
so the a negative 1
negative b
c negative 1
negative d
so just remember
that little equation
because in your
test and exam
you're probably going to
get this as
you know
school algebra equations
you've got to
transform that
into all the unknowns
on one side
and from that
you're going to create
this augmented matrix
and so if you just
keep this little equation
18 in mind
you won't ever make a mistake
so let's do here
in problem 4
so what we see
in problem 4 here
is
two equations
and two unknowns
and I've already
brought them all
to one side
but you do realize
that that first one
is just
y equals x
because if I take
the 2x
to the other side
it becomes
negative 2y
equals negative 2x
divided by
or multiplied by
negative 1 half
it becomes y equals x
so that's just a
straight line
y equals x
and you see the
second one there
if it is
two equations
there
and two unknowns
remember
an equation
with two unknowns
that's just a
straight line
here we're dealing
with linear
and linear algebra
meaning we're not
talking about x squared
we're not talking
about x times y
or the sine of x
and the log of y
you know
these are linear equations
so there we do
I've drawn
the two of them
here with some code
and you can
look at the code
there
but if I have
two equations
and two unknowns
and they're both
you know
the two unknowns
meaning it's
straight lines
if the three equations
we're talking about
planes
in three dimensional
space
but as I said
I'm going to
keep it easy
they intersect
some way
and where they
intersect
is the solution
to the linear system
because I've got
two values
you know
a value for x
and a value for y
that solves both
of those together
that's what it means
so I want you
to have that
intuitive understanding
about these linear
systems as well
it's lines
or planes
or hyperplanes
if we go to
higher dimensions
that intersect
some way
and if they
intersect at a point
that point
which is actually
a vector
if you think about it
because I can go
from 0.0
to that solution
point
and there's a vector
pointing there
that's also
again everything
boils down to vectors
and we'll get to
that as well
so if I have
a linear system
and it intersects
like this
remembering that
the physical representation
of my linear system
is just this graph
then I'm going to get
again I'm going to call
this a proper one
because I'm going to get
a single solution
and that's the solution
for this linear system
so if I write that
as an augmented matrix
that negative 2
or the 2x plus
negative 2y equals 0
there's my
right here
I'm doing a row
reduced echelon form
of that
and I see that
I end up with
1 1
0 is above and below it
so that's reduced
row echelon form
and I can read my
solution on the
right hand side
1 1
so x equals 1
y equals 1
it's a solution
to that
and the reason
why we have
this one specific
solution
is because
this linear system
represented two lines
that have a single
point of intersection
so let's look
at problem number 5
here I have a linear
system again
x plus y equals 2
and 2x plus 2y
equals 4
and if you're
very quick
you can see
the second one
is just a constant
multiple of the
first
so what they really
are if I plot them
as two lines
that are coincident
upon each other
and if they're
coincident upon each
other you can see
both of them there
you know you can
take the one away
by clicking on it
then just the blue
one is there
you can take the
blue one away as
well there's nothing
there
let's add the blue
one and then let's
add the red one
again they're right
on top of each other
because you know
in disguise that's
the same equation
they're just written
twice
a system has
these two equations
and later on
we'll see is
they're not
independent of each
other
one is a constant
multiple of each
other
but what you can
clearly see from
the graph of this
is we have
infinitely many
solutions
there are infinitely
many x's and y's
that I can plug
into the system
that will solve
the system
because the two
lines are coincident
no matter what x
I choose
there's going to be
a y
that solves
the system
so in the end
there's going to be
infinite many solutions
it's going to go off
to positive and
negative infinity
on both axes
and if I do this
Gauss-Jordan elimination
this is what you're
going to end up with
again this last one
being all zeros
because it was
redundant
and on the first one
we can read off
sort of
the fact that this
is a straight line
because it says x plus y
equals 2
or y equals
negative x plus 2
and that means
whatever x I plug in
I'm going to get a y
indicating the fact
that there's
infinitely many solutions
and then here
in problem 6
is the fact that
I have two parallel lines
so this is a linear system
where the lines
never intersect
we're talking
Euclidean space here
nothing special
and there's no solution
to this
they never intersect
so what would that
look like
if we do
Gauss-Jordan elimination
using elementary row operations
what is that going to look like
well
it becomes nonsensical
because look at
the reduced row echelon form here
using the RREF function
I shouldn't hide it
the RREF
of this augmented matrix
you see that
this second row says
0 times x sub 1
or
I've used x and y
so let's stick to that
0 times x
plus 0 times y
gives me a non-zero number
and that's nonsense
I mean if you
if you add
two things
that you've multiplied
by 0
they both be 0
and 0 plus 0 is 0
so the right hand side
can't be a
non-zero value
that is nonsensical
and that tells you
that
this system
has no solutions
there's no solutions
to the system
it's an inconsistent
linear system
is what we call it
ok so go off
do good work
create a bunch of your own
or get them out of your textbook
and if your textbook
doesn't show you all the solutions
you know
create your own
because then you know
what the solutions are
and then more importantly
and much more fun
come check your results
just using
RREF
it's as simple as that
but I want you to have
this deeper
start developing
this deeper intuition
of what's going on here
many of you
are going to start
linear algebra
by looking at
solving linear systems
they're exciting
they're boring
once you know
how to do them
you pass your exam
you get your little
rubber stamp
or little gold star
which is what I want
most in life
for you
is to do well
and
enjoy linear algebra
and see the usefulness
of it
and go out
and use it
because it's used
everywhere
linear algebra
for me
is
perhaps more important
than calculus
anyway
that's a different story
so what we
what we're doing here
is starting to develop
this intuition
that
it's not only
good for
solving linear systems
matrices are
these mathematical objects
in their own right
just as a number is
a real number
or a complex number
or an integer
or an irrational number
it's a mathematical object
and just like
those numbers are
a matrix is also
a mathematical object
and it is so useful
and it is so powerful
and it's so much fun
I mean
it's the greatest amount
of fun
you can have
probably one of the
in mathematics
so it's important
to develop this love
and this deep understanding
of it
so you can see
you know
what we can
what absolute power
is hidden inside
of a matrix
and we'll certainly
try and get to
all of those
in this first
two sections
the first one was on vectors
the second one
now matrices
but I'm splitting
the second one up
as I said
into multiple videos
so I hope you enjoyed
that one
leave a comment
ask me to make
some other things
or you know
these notebooks
going to be available
to you on github
also if I remember
put a link down below
to show you
how to install Julia
and create
an environment
and use Pluto
as we've done
here
I've made videos
on those
many people
have watched those
so hope you found
this one helpful

it's a little
silly fun
anyway
