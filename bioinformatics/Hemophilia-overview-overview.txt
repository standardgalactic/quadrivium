Haemophilia A and B are bleeding disorders caused by deficiencies in clotting factors 8 and 9, respectively. Most individuals with haemophilia are diagnosed early, but some may be identified later due to spontaneous joint or muscle bleeds if their factor activity is below 1%, indicating severe haemophilia. Moderate and mild cases often experience bleeding after trauma or surgery. Diagnosis involves a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test and specific factor analysis. Management includes administering the deficient coagulation factors before and after surgery, typically for 7 to 10 days depending on the procedure.
