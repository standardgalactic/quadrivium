The text describes the process and principles involved in translating a coordinate system and transforming coordinates. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Vector Translation**: When the origin of a coordinate system is shifted, the vectors themselves do not change in magnitude or direction; they only appear to move along with the shift.

2. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - To translate the origin from \((0, 0)\) to \((k, l)\), the coordinates of any point \(P(x, y)\) transform to new coordinates \(P'(x', y')\) using:
     - \(x' = x - k\)
     - \(y' = y - l\)

3. **Reversing Transformation**:
   - To revert from translated coordinates back to original ones:
     - \(x = x' + k\)
     - \(y = y' + l\)

4. **Vector Consistency**: The vector between two points remains unchanged across translations, as long as the translation is parallel.

### Example:

- **Original Points**:
  - \(P(2, 0)\) and \(Q(3, 6)\).

- **Translation by \((k, l) = (4, 1)\)**:
  - New coordinates for \(P'\): 
    - \(x' = 2 - 4 = -2\)
    - \(y' = 0 - 1 = -1\) 
    - Resulting in \(P'(-2, -1)\).
  
  - New coordinates for \(Q'\):
    - \(x' = 3 - 4 = -1\)
    - \(y' = 6 - 1 = 5\) 
    - Resulting in \(Q'(-1, 5)\).

- **Vector Consistency**:
  - Original vector \(\overrightarrow{PQ}\) has components (1, 6).
  - Translated vector \(\overrightarrow{P'Q'}\) also has components (1, 6), confirming consistency.

- **Reversing Transformation**:
  - From \(P'(-2, -1)\) to original coordinates: 
    - \(x = -2 + 4 = 2\)
    - \(y = -1 + 1 = 0\) 

  - From \(Q'(-1, 5)\) to original coordinates:
    - \(x = -1 + 4 = 3\)
    - \(y = 5 + 1 = 6\)

This demonstrates how translations affect coordinate systems while maintaining vector consistency.
