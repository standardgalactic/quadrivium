The text outlines a method for solving a system of differential equations using matrix transformations. The system is defined by the linear combinations \( x' = x + 3y \) and \( y' = 5x + 3y \). To solve this, one seeks functions \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

Proposed solutions are given as exponential functions: \( x(t) = e^{-2t} \) and \( y(t) = -e^{-2t} \). These are verified by substituting them back into the original differential equations, confirming their validity. Additionally, an eigenvalue approach (\( \lambda_2 = 6 \)) is mentioned as another method to find a solution set, yielding consistent results with the exponential solutions, thus verifying their correctness.
