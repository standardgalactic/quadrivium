The task involves evaluating the definite integral of \(\sin(x)\) from \(0\) to \(2\pi\). The antiderivative of \(\sin(x)\) is \(-\cos(x)\). Evaluating at the bounds:

1. At \(x = 2\pi\), \(-\cos(2\pi) = -1\).
2. At \(x = 0\), \(-\cos(0) = -1\).

The definite integral is calculated as:

\[
-\cos(2\pi) - (-\cos(0)) = -1 - (-1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the value of the definite integral is \(0\).
