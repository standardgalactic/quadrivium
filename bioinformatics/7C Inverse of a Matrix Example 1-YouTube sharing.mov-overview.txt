The text describes verifying whether the product of a 2x2 matrix \( A \) and its inverse results in the identity matrix. It performs two checks: multiplying \( A \) by its inverse, and then reversing the order to multiply the inverse by \( A \). In both cases, the calculations confirm that the products yield the identity matrix, confirming the correctness of the inverse calculation. The detailed steps involve using the formula for a 2x2 inverse matrix and checking each element in the resulting product matrices. This demonstrates that multiplying a matrix by its inverse yields an identity matrix, verifying the concept of matrix inversion.

The text discusses verifying the inverse of a 2x2 matrix \( A \) using matrix multiplication. The aim is to confirm whether multiplying matrix \( A \) by its calculated inverse results in the identity matrix, both when the inverse precedes and follows \( A \). 

1. **Multiplication Process:**
   - For \( A \times \text{inverse of } A \), each element of the resulting 2x2 matrix is derived from multiplying corresponding row elements of \( A \) with column elements of its inverse.
   - The calculations confirm that this multiplication results in an identity matrix, where:
     - Top-left and bottom-right elements are 1 (diagonal).
     - Top-right and bottom-left elements are 0.

2. **Reversal Check:**
   - Similarly, multiplying the inverse by \( A \) also yields the identity matrix.
   - This is verified through analogous row-by-column multiplication processes, confirming consistency regardless of multiplication order.

The text concludes that these operations affirm the existence and correctness of the inverse for matrix \( A \), as the product in both orders results in an identity matrix.
