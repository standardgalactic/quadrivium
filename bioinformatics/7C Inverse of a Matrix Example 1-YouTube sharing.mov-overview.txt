The text describes verifying whether the product of a 2x2 matrix \( A \) and its inverse results in the identity matrix. It performs two checks: multiplying \( A \) by its inverse, and then reversing the order to multiply the inverse by \( A \). In both cases, the calculations confirm that the products yield the identity matrix, confirming the correctness of the inverse calculation. The detailed steps involve using the formula for a 2x2 inverse matrix and checking each element in the resulting product matrices. This demonstrates that multiplying a matrix by its inverse yields an identity matrix, verifying the concept of matrix inversion.
