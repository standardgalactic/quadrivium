Let's break down the steps involved in using the integral test to determine whether the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\) converges or diverges. Here's a concise explanation of how this works:

### Integral Test Conditions:
To use the integral test, ensure that:

1. **\(f(x)\) is Positive:** \(f(x) > 0\) for all \(x \geq N\), where \(N\) is some positive integer.
2. **\(f(x)\) is Continuous:** The function \(f(x)\) is continuous on the interval \([N, \infty)\).
3. **\(f(x)\) is Decreasing:** The function \(f(x)\) is decreasing for all \(x \geq N\).

### Steps of the Integral Test:

1. **Identify Function:**
   - Given a series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\), identify the corresponding function \(f(x)\).

2. **Check Conditions:**
   - Verify that \(f(x)\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \(x \geq N\).

3. **Evaluate Improper Integral:**
   - Compute the improper integral \(\int_{N}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx\).
   - This involves finding \(\lim_{r \to \infty} \int_{N}^{r} f(x) \, dx\).

4. **Conclude Convergence or Divergence:**
   - If the improper integral converges to a finite value, then the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\) also converges.
   - If the improper integral diverges (i.e., approaches infinity), then the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\) diverges.

### Example Application:

Let's apply this to a hypothetical function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}\):

1. **Identify Function:**
   - Here, \(f(n) = \frac{1}{n^2}\), so \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}\).

2. **Check Conditions:**
   - Positive: \(f(x) > 0\) for \(x > 0\).
   - Continuous: \(f(x)\) is continuous for \(x > 0\).
   - Decreasing: The derivative \(f'(x) = -\frac{2}{x^3} < 0\) for \(x > 0\), so it's decreasing.

3. **Evaluate Improper Integral:**
   \[
   \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx = \lim_{r \to \infty} \int_{1}^{r} \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx
   \]
   - Compute the integral: 
     \[
     \int \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx = -\frac{1}{x}
     \]
   - Evaluate from 1 to \(r\):
     \[
     \left[-\frac{1}{x}\right]_{1}^{r} = \left(-\frac{1}{r}\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{1}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{r}
     \]
   - Take the limit as \(r \to \infty\):
     \[
     \lim_{r \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{r}\right) = 1
     \]

4. **Conclude Convergence:**
   - Since the integral converges to 1, the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}\) also converges.

This process demonstrates how the integral test can be used to determine the convergence or divergence of a series by evaluating the corresponding improper integral.

Certainly! Let's break down the process of using the integral test to determine whether a given series converges or diverges. We'll use your detailed description as a framework.

### Steps for Applying the Integral Test

1. **Express the Series as a Function:**
   - Start by expressing the terms of the series \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \) as a function \( f(x) \), where \( f(n) = a_n \). The function should be continuous, positive, and decreasing for \( x \geq 1 \).

2. **Check Continuity and Monotonicity:**
   - Ensure that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous for \( x \geq 1 \).
   - Verify that \( f(x) \) is decreasing for \( x \geq 1 \). This can be checked by confirming that the derivative \( f'(x) < 0 \).

3. **Set Up the Improper Integral:**
   - Consider the improper integral \( \int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx \).
   - Evaluate this integral as a limit: 
     \[
     \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{1}^{b} f(x) \, dx
     \]

4. **Evaluate the Integral:**
   - Compute the integral \( \int_{1}^{b} f(x) \, dx \).
   - Use substitution or other integration techniques as necessary.

5. **Determine Convergence or Divergence:**
   - If the improper integral converges (i.e., it results in a finite number), then the series \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \) also converges.
   - If the improper integral diverges, then the series diverges.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's apply these steps to a specific example:

Suppose you have the series \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \).

1. **Express as a Function:**
   - The function is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \).

2. **Check Continuity and Monotonicity:**
   - \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \) is continuous for \( x > 0 \).
   - Check if it's decreasing: 
     \[
     f'(x) = -\frac{2}{x^3} < 0 \quad \text{for } x > 0
     \]
   - Thus, \( f(x) \) is decreasing for \( x \geq 1 \).

3. **Set Up the Improper Integral:**
   - Consider \( \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx \).
   - Evaluate as a limit:
     \[
     \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{1}^{b} \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx
     \]

4. **Evaluate the Integral:**
   - Compute \( \int_{1}^{b} \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx \):
     \[
     = \left[ -\frac{1}{x} \right]_{1}^{b} = -\frac{1}{b} + 1
     \]
   - Take the limit as \( b \to \infty \):
     \[
     \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( -\frac{1}{b} + 1 \right) = 1
     \]

5. **Determine Convergence or Divergence:**
   - Since the integral converges to 1, the series \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \) also converges.

This process illustrates how the integral test can be used to determine the convergence of a series by relating it to an improper integral.
