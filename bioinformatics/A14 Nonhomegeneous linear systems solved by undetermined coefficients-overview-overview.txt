The lecture covers solving non-homogeneous linear systems of differential equations, which differ from homogeneous systems by including an external forcing function (\( f(t) \)). Traditional methods for single differential equations are not always suitable for these systems. Two primary methods discussed are undetermined coefficients and linear algebra techniques.

The method of undetermined coefficients involves finding a particular solution \( X_p \) to the non-homogeneous system, which can be complex when extending from single equations to systems. An example is provided with the forcing function \( f(t) = [-8, 3]^T \), where a particular solution in the form of constants \( [a_1, b_1]^T \) leads to algebraic equations solved using linear algebra techniques like row reduction. The specific values found for this example are \( a_1 = 14 \) and \( b_1 = 11 \).

The complete solution is expressed as \( X = X_c + X_p \), where \( X_c \) is the complementary (homogeneous) solution, and \( X_p \) is the particular solution. The lecture emphasizes verifying the consistency of this solution by substituting it back into the original equation.
