The introduction to matrices in linear algebra begins by defining a matrix as an organized table of numbers arranged into rows and columns, typically enclosed in brackets and labeled with bold uppercase letters. Matrices serve several purposes: they represent physical phenomena (e.g., data on the number of kittens born over years), vectors used in physics, and mathematical objects representing systems of linear equations.

A matrix can be manipulated mathematically to solve a system of linear equations. However, these equations must adhere to specific rulesâ€”they cannot include products or divisions of unknowns, variables raised to powers other than one, or logarithmic or trigonometric functions.

To construct a matrix from a set of linear equations, each element is assigned an address based on its row and column position within the matrix. For example, in a 3x3 matrix named "A," elements are denoted as lowercase 'a' with subscripts indicating their row (i) and column (j) positions.

The text introduces several types of matrices: square matrices (equal number of rows and columns), symmetric matrices (elements mirror across the main diagonal), and diagonal matrices (all non-diagonal elements are zero).
