The text provides instructions on performing basic matrix operations—addition and subtraction—between two 3x3 matrices, A and B. It highlights that these operations require the matrices to be of equal dimensions. 

1. **Matrix Addition (A + B):** 
   - Elements in corresponding positions are added together.
   - Example: For position (1, 1), add 3 from matrix A and -3 from matrix B to get 0.

2. **Matrix Subtraction (A - B):**
   - Elements in corresponding positions of matrix A are subtracted by those in matrix B.
   - Example: For position (1, 1), subtract -3 from matrix B from 3 in matrix A to get 6.

3. **Subtraction of Matrix A from B (B - A):**
   - Similar process as subtraction but performed as B minus A.
   - Example: For position (1, 1), subtract 3 from matrix A from -3 in matrix B to get -6.

The text stresses the importance of tracking matrix positions and ensuring matrices are the same size for these operations.
