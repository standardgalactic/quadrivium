This text introduces radioactivity and discusses how it was first studied. Radioactive substances are unstable nuclei that decay over time, emitting particles or rays. In early experiments using magnetic fields and photographic plates, three types of radiation were identified: alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays.

- **Alpha rays** consist of positively charged particles (helium nuclei without electrons) and can be stopped by a thin sheet of lead (~0.01 mm).
- **Beta rays** are negatively charged particles that deflect in magnetic fields opposite to alpha rays and require thicker lead (~0.1 mm) to stop them.
- **Gamma rays** have no charge, do not deflect in a magnetic field, and need much denser material (about 10 cm of lead) to be absorbed.

The discovery of radioactivity led to the establishment of new conservation laws in physics:
- Mass-energy conservation
- Conservation of linear momentum
- Conservation of angular momentum
- Conservation of electric charge
- Conservation of nucleon number during radioactive decay

Alpha decay, a type of radioactive decay where an alpha particle is emitted from a nucleus, results in transmutation, changing one element into another. This process highlights the transformation capabilities of nuclear reactions, contrasting with chemical processes like those attempted by alchemists to turn substances into gold, which are impossible due to conservation laws.

This text describes two types of nuclear transmutation processes involving electrons: alpha decay and beta-negative decay.

1. **Alpha Decay**:
   - Involves a parent atom losing an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (essentially a helium nucleus).
   - The atomic number decreases by 2, and the mass number decreases by 4.
   - Example: Uranium-238 decays to Thorium-234, releasing energy in the form of kinetic energy for the alpha particle and a bit as gamma rays. This transformation occurs because an unstable nucleus becomes more stable through the emission of an alpha particle.

2. **Beta-Negative Decay**:
   - In this process, a neutron is transformed into a proton, resulting in the emission of a beta particle (an electron) and an antineutrino.
   - The atomic number increases by 1 while the mass number remains unchanged.
   - This decay occurs to increase stability in the nucleus by converting excess neutrons into protons.

In both processes, energy is released due to changes in nuclear binding energy, and conservation laws (such as momentum) govern the distribution of kinetic energy among the emitted particles.

The text describes the process of beta negative decay and its impact on atomic structure. In beta negative decay, a neutron within an atom's nucleus is converted into a proton and an electron. This conversion results in an increase in the atomic number by one (since a proton is added), while the atomic mass number remains unchanged because the nucleon count stays constant (a neutron is replaced by a proton).

The example given involves thorium-234 undergoing beta negative decay to form protactinium-234, with the emission of an electron and energy. In this process:

- The atomic number increases from 90 (thorium) to 91 (protactinium).
- The mass number stays at 234.
- An electron is emitted, carrying away most of the released energy, which is approximately 0.27 mega-electron volts.

This type of decay exemplifies nuclear transmutation, where one element transforms into another. Unlike alpha decay, where protons are lost, beta negative decay results in gaining a proton.

The text also briefly mentions that there are other types of beta decay, though it doesn't delve into them extensively.

The text discusses two types of nuclear decay processes: electron capture (also known as K-capture) and beta-positive decay.

In **electron capture**, an atom's nucleus captures one of its orbiting electrons, usually from the innermost shell (K-shell). This process prevents beta-negative decay by capturing an electron instead of emitting a neutrino and converting a neutron into a proton. As a result, a proton in the nucleus is transformed into a neutron.

In **beta-positive decay**, a proton within the nucleus converts into a neutron while releasing a positron (a positively charged particle) and a neutrino. This process also leads to nuclear transmutation because the atomic number decreases by one (since a proton is lost), but the mass number remains unchanged as the total number of nucleons stays constant.

Both processes involve changes in the composition of an atom's nucleus, leading to the transformation from a parent element to a different daughter element.
