This text introduces radioactivity and discusses how it was first studied. Radioactive substances are unstable nuclei that decay over time, emitting particles or rays. In early experiments using magnetic fields and photographic plates, three types of radiation were identified: alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays.

- **Alpha rays** consist of positively charged particles (helium nuclei without electrons) and can be stopped by a thin sheet of lead (~0.01 mm).
- **Beta rays** are negatively charged particles that deflect in magnetic fields opposite to alpha rays and require thicker lead (~0.1 mm) to stop them.
- **Gamma rays** have no charge, do not deflect in a magnetic field, and need much denser material (about 10 cm of lead) to be absorbed.

The discovery of radioactivity led to the establishment of new conservation laws in physics:
- Mass-energy conservation
- Conservation of linear momentum
- Conservation of angular momentum
- Conservation of electric charge
- Conservation of nucleon number during radioactive decay

Alpha decay, a type of radioactive decay where an alpha particle is emitted from a nucleus, results in transmutation, changing one element into another. This process highlights the transformation capabilities of nuclear reactions, contrasting with chemical processes like those attempted by alchemists to turn substances into gold, which are impossible due to conservation laws.

This text describes two types of nuclear transmutation processes involving electrons: alpha decay and beta-negative decay.

1. **Alpha Decay**:
   - Involves a parent atom losing an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (essentially a helium nucleus).
   - The atomic number decreases by 2, and the mass number decreases by 4.
   - Example: Uranium-238 decays to Thorium-234, releasing energy in the form of kinetic energy for the alpha particle and a bit as gamma rays. This transformation occurs because an unstable nucleus becomes more stable through the emission of an alpha particle.

2. **Beta-Negative Decay**:
   - In this process, a neutron is transformed into a proton, resulting in the emission of a beta particle (an electron) and an antineutrino.
   - The atomic number increases by 1 while the mass number remains unchanged.
   - This decay occurs to increase stability in the nucleus by converting excess neutrons into protons.

In both processes, energy is released due to changes in nuclear binding energy, and conservation laws (such as momentum) govern the distribution of kinetic energy among the emitted particles.

The text describes the process of beta negative decay and its impact on atomic structure. In beta negative decay, a neutron within an atom's nucleus is converted into a proton and an electron. This conversion results in an increase in the atomic number by one (since a proton is added), while the atomic mass number remains unchanged because the nucleon count stays constant (a neutron is replaced by a proton).

The example given involves thorium-234 undergoing beta negative decay to form protactinium-234, with the emission of an electron and energy. In this process:

- The atomic number increases from 90 (thorium) to 91 (protactinium).
- The mass number stays at 234.
- An electron is emitted, carrying away most of the released energy, which is approximately 0.27 mega-electron volts.

This type of decay exemplifies nuclear transmutation, where one element transforms into another. Unlike alpha decay, where protons are lost, beta negative decay results in gaining a proton.

The text also briefly mentions that there are other types of beta decay, though it doesn't delve into them extensively.

The text discusses two types of nuclear decay processes: electron capture (also known as K-capture) and beta-positive decay.

In **electron capture**, an atom's nucleus captures one of its orbiting electrons, usually from the innermost shell (K-shell). This process prevents beta-negative decay by capturing an electron instead of emitting a neutrino and converting a neutron into a proton. As a result, a proton in the nucleus is transformed into a neutron.

In **beta-positive decay**, a proton within the nucleus converts into a neutron while releasing a positron (a positively charged particle) and a neutrino. This process also leads to nuclear transmutation because the atomic number decreases by one (since a proton is lost), but the mass number remains unchanged as the total number of nucleons stays constant.

Both processes involve changes in the composition of an atom's nucleus, leading to the transformation from a parent element to a different daughter element.

This text provides an introduction to radioactivity, focusing on its discovery and characterization through early experiments. Radioactive substances were identified as having unstable nuclei that decay over time. Early observations involved using a magnetic field and photographic plates to detect different types of rays emitted during radioactive decay.

1. **Types of Rays:**
   - **Alpha rays:** These are positively charged particles (essentially helium nuclei) that are deflected upward by a magnetic field, stopped by about 0.01 millimeters of lead.
   - **Beta rays:** Negatively charged particles that deflect downward in a magnetic field and require thicker lead to stop them compared to alpha particles.
   - **Gamma rays:** Electrically neutral and undetected by the magnetic field; they are highly penetrating and need around 10 centimeters of lead for shielding.

2. **Radioactive Decay:**
   - The process involves changes that occur within an atomic nucleus, leading to different types of decay such as alpha decay.
   - Alpha decay results in a transmutation where one element is transformed into another, due to the emission of an alpha particle (helium nucleus).
   
3. **Conservation Laws:**
   - Several conservation laws apply to radioactive decay:
     - Mass-energy conservation
     - Conservation of linear and angular momentum
     - Conservation of electric charge
     - Conservation of nucleon number (total number of protons and neutrons)

The text connects these observations to broader scientific principles, emphasizing the transformation of elements through nuclear processes rather than chemical reactions.

The text discusses nuclear transmutation focusing on electrons and energy release. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Transmutation Process**: A parent atom with a specific atomic number and mass (protons + neutrons) transforms into a helium nucleus, reducing its atomic number by 2 and mass number by 4.

2. **Example with Uranium-238**: When uranium-238 undergoes this transformation, it becomes thorium-234, releasing an alpha particle (helium nucleus). This process emits energy without requiring input energy, as the initial unstable nucleus transitions to a more stable form.

3. **Energy Release**: The released energy is primarily converted into kinetic energy for the resultant particles and a small amount into gamma rays. Conservation of momentum ensures that the total initial and final momentum remains zero, with the lighter particle moving faster than the heavier one.

4. **Mass-Energy Calculation**: Using mass units (including electrons), the energy release can be calculated. For uranium-238 to thorium-234 decay, approximately 4.3 MeV is released.

5. **Beta Decay Introduction**: The text briefly introduces beta negative decay, where a beta particle (electron) is emitted. This type of decay is one among three kinds, characterized by the transformation involving electrons and changes in atomic number without altering mass significantly.

The text describes the process of beta negative decay in atomic physics. In this type of decay, a neutron within an atom's nucleus is converted into a proton and an electron (beta particle). This transformation results in an increase of one in the atomic number while the mass number remains unchanged. As a consequence, the element transforms into a new daughter element with one more proton than the parent element.

The example given involves thorium-234 undergoing beta negative decay to become protactinium-234. The process conserves nucleon numbers (protons plus neutrons), but changes the atomic number from 90 (thorium) to 91 (protactinium). This transmutation is accompanied by the release of an electron and energy, measured in mega-electron volts.

The text also notes that protactinium-234 will have a positive charge due to the emission of the electron. The discussion suggests calculating the energy involved in this decay process using atomic mass units, leading to an approximate energy release of 0.27 MeV (mega-electron volts) or 270 keV (kilo-electron volts).

Finally, it mentions that there are other types of beta decay, but implies these will not be discussed in detail within the text.

The text discusses two types of radioactive decay: electron capture (also known as K capture) and beta-plus decay.

**Electron Capture (K Capture):**
- In this process, the nucleus captures an orbiting electron, typically from the closest shell to the nucleus, which is the K shell. 
- This results in a neutron being formed inside the nucleus, replacing a proton.
- The atomic number decreases by one as a result of losing a proton, while the mass number remains unchanged.

**Beta-Plus Decay (Positron Emission):**
- In beta-plus decay, a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron and a positron (a particle with a positive electric charge).
- The emission of a positron causes the atomic number to decrease by one since a proton is transformed into a neutron.
- Similar to electron capture, the mass number remains unchanged.

Both processes lead to the transformation of one element into another (transmutation) while conserving the total nucleon count and satisfying conservation laws for atomic numbers.
