The text provides an overview of various less common types of hernias:

1. **Spigelian Hernia**: These occur at the lateral edge of the rectus muscles, usually above a line between the anterior superior iliac spines. They often cause intermittent bulges and chronic pain, sometimes mistaken for other issues. Diagnosis typically involves imaging or surgical exploration, with various repair methods available.

2. **Lumber Hernias**: Can develop spontaneously, from injury, or post-incision surgeries like kidney work. These occur in natural defects between muscles such as the iliac crest, latissimus dorsi, and oblique muscles, presenting with intermittent lumps or pain. Repair is similar to that for ventral hernias.

3. **Pelvic Floor Hernias**: Includes obturator, perineal, and sciatic hernias:
   - *Obturator Hernia*: Passes through the obturator membrane; common in emaciated older females, leading to bowel obstruction or necrosis.
   - *Perineal Hernia*: Often forms after major pelvic surgeries.
   - *Sciatic Hernia*: Occurs due to a defect in the piriformis muscle causing nerve entrapment.

4. **Internal Hernias**: Result from adhesions or torsion post-surgery, creating false openings for bowel herniation. They also occur through natural openings like Winslow’s and Blandin's hernias.

5. **Peristomal Hernias**: Related to stomas, presenting as bulges or prolapse of the stoma bowel, potentially causing obstruction or evisceration. Prevention involves meticulous surgical technique, with repair options including direct correction, recutting the stoma, or using mesh for support.

6. **Erector Hernia**: Characterized by a small hernia neck containing part of the bowel wall, risking incarceration or strangulation without necessarily obstructing the bowel lumen; often seen in small ventral hernias.

7. **Littré's Hernia**: Involves a Meckel’s diverticulum within the hernia sac, requiring decisions on both hernia repair and potential bowel resection and anastomosis.

Each type requires specific diagnostic approaches and tailored surgical interventions for management.
