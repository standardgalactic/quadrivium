Now this is quite a powerful but fun video.
I'm going to show you how we relate a p-value to geometrical area.
Now, with geometrical area I mean the area of a circle, the area of a triangle, the area of a square.
You know those equations.
Bit more difficult in statistics.
The mathematics behind statistics draws a nice little graph for you.
And the area under that curve, specific areas under that curve is a p-value.
Have a look at this.
