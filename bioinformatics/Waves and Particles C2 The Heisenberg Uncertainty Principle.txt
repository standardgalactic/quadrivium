Now I want to show you Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle at work.
We've just seen from the Schrodinger wave equation
that the particle could be anywhere from negative infinity to positive infinity
on the x-axis.
In Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,
that certainly was one of the examples of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
And the way that most books describe it is that you have an electron
through a single slip, and what you see is the first bright fringe.
So you're going to see this probability curve.
Highest probability that it hits there and it gets less and less probable
until you get to the first dark fringes.
If you think about it, though, this electron comes in purely on,
we've taken here as the x-axis, so it has momentum in the x-axis.
It has momentum in the x-axis, and then we can work out that momentum
in the x-axis according to the Broglie wavelength
as much as it's constant divided by the wavelength.
Now, it will carry on straight.
Highest probability to hit in the center of the screen,
so certainly that momentum carries on.
But how can it have a probability to hit here on the screen,
or there, or there, or there, or there?
It must acquire some momentum in the y-direction.
Out of nowhere, it just goes through the single slip.
It has to get some momentum in the y-direction.
And now we're going to get back again to this probability.
It was noted in the early 19, first half of the 20th century,
that this delta p in the y-direction, delta p y,
so that is the momentum in the y-direction.
This delta makes it a probability.
And it can be anywhere from 0 to that angle theta,
till that angle theta.
So that is the probability of it having momentum
in the y-direction, is delta p y.
The probability can be from 0, momentum in the y-direction,
till this angle theta, so up till there.
If I now just look at the tangent of theta here,
I'm going to get delta p y.
That's my uncertainty, my probability of momentum
in the y-direction,
divided by momentum in the x-direction,
which it carries through before it even enters the slip.
Now, this slit has a width w, that slit w.
And we have an equation for that,
if we remember defraction,
when we do work with the width,
and that is going to be lambda divided by the width.
Lambda divided by, let's make capital W for width.
Now, this angle theta is extremely small,
and with a small angle approximation,
we know that the tangent of theta
is almost equal to the sine of theta,
for very small angles that we are dealing with.
So we can say that delta p y,
the probability of any kind of momentum
in the y-direction, divided by p x,
is going to equal lambda divided by w.
Lambda divided by w.
But we have an equation for p x from the Broglie.
So we're going to have delta p in the y-direction,
divided by h.
Lambda equals lambda divided by w.
Those will go, so the probability
of gaining any momentum in the y-direction,
is going to equal h divided by w.
So we can equate the probability
of getting any momentum in the y-direction.
We can calculate that based on the width
of this slit.
Now we're using the single slit
or double slit experiments
and to explain some of these equations,
but it need not be,
it need not be,
it does not only pertain to a double slit.
This double slit experiment
gives us some understanding
of the nature of particles,
and one of the aspects of the nature
of these particles have come out
is that there is this probability in momentum.
And now we're going to,
from this go on to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,
and what we'll notice is that
the absolute position of a particle
and the momentum of a particle
cannot both be known,
not only in a double slit situation,
but in any situation,
we can't know both to absolute accuracy.
And you'll see equations for that
in the next section.
Now, the equations for Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
In many textbooks,
you'll find this h with a line for it
is pronounced h bar,
and it's plums constant divided by 2 pi.
And what Heisenberg's uncertainty principle now says
is if we have a position vector
and a momentum vector,
we cannot know both to absolute accuracy.
So there is a free particle moving, moving, moving
in a coordinate system.
It's there at the moment,
so I can draw a vector,
a position vector there are,
and it is moving at this moment
in that direction.
And if it's mass,
there will be its,
so for instance,
that momentum vector.
But we cannot know both
with absolute certainty,
with absolute accuracy.
And that is not the deficiency
of our measuring equipment,
measuring methods,
that is a fundamental principle
of nature.
So what we do know then,
if the probability of finding it
in the x direction
times the probability
of it having any momentum
in the x direction
must be equal to larger than h bar.
So that h bar now is h divided by 2 pi.
You'll see in some textbooks
which are more basic textbooks,
you're going to see not h bar,
but you're going to see h over 4 pi.
So please do your examples
and your exams
according to the equations
that are used in your textbooks.
More advanced textbooks
will have h bar
which is over 2 pi.
And then in more basic textbooks,
you're going to have h over 4 pi.
So be very careful
what textbook you have
or what your examiner
or lecturer demands from you.
The same is going to happen
in the y direction.
And we just did an example
with momentum in the y direction
as far as the single slip
with an electron was concerned.
Okay, so that's going to be
delta p in the y direction
and it's also going to be
equal to a larger than h bar
and delta z,
delta p in the z direction
is also going to be equal
to larger than h bar.
Now what this says is
if I know the y position
the y position of a particle
to fairly good accuracy
so this number
is fairly large
that means
for you to multiply these two
it must be equal to
or greater than h bar.
Actually, it's difficult
to understand exactly
what this means
let's do the next section
an example of this
and you'll see
what this means
in relation to it
having to be
large or equal to an h bar.
Good.
Here we have
an electron
moving on
the x-axis
so we're only looking
at its velocity
on the x-axis
which is 2.05
times 10 to the power
6 meters per second
and we have
an accuracy
of 0.50%
that's our accuracy
so at that speed
we definitely talk about
non-relativistic velocity
so we don't have to use
relativistic equations
for momentum.
Can I pinpoint
this electron
on the x-axis?
What would be my accuracy
in predicting
exactly
where it is?
Can I know
because if we have
a car driving
along the road
and we make that
x-axis
it has a certain velocity
I can see the car
I can pinpoint it
exactly
no actually you can't
let's have a look
at this
let's work out
the momentum
along the x-axis
for
this particle
it's going to be
mass times
velocity
in the x-direction
so that's going to be
the mass of an electron
times
vx
but now
there is some uncertainty
delta px
there's some uncertainty
because I'm not
100%
it's not 100% accurate
what this velocity is
so
0.50%
is 0.0050
mass of the electron
v in the x-direction
that is
the probability
of its momentum
because I only have
that accuracy
so you take that
and you multiply it
by
mass times velocity
now from
Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle
I know that
delta px
is going to be
larger than
or equal to
h-bar
divided by
well let's do
delta x
is what we want
isn't it
apologies
delta x
is what we want
h-bar
divided by
delta p
in the x-direction
now this is going
to be our
delta p
in the x-direction
and as I say
just be aware
what we're using
we are using
h-bar
as h
divided by
2 pi
not 4 pi
here
so that's going
to give me
a delta x
is
now
it's going to be
larger than
or equal to
so if I say
what is the
minimum uncertainty
as delta
refers to
the uncertainty
that I have
I can't pinpoint
it
all I can say
it will be
somewhere
within a
certain
length
so I can use
the equal sign
here because I
want the minimum
okay that's going
to be h-bar
which is h
divided by
2 pi
times
0.0050
times mass
of the electron
times velocity
in the x-direction
and that gives
me a delta x
see for yourself
of about
11.3 nanometers
11.3 nanometers
so I cannot
pinpoint it
it has a
probability of
being in that
certain length
now that is
I think more
than about
100 atoms
width
and I'm talking
about an
electric
so I do
not know
in the
sizes
the reality
of the sizes
that we're
dealing with
I have no
clue
actually a way
to go and
pinpoint that
so with this
accuracy
my uncertainty
here
which is
actually fairly
accurate
it has a
massive
compared to
its size
area on the
x-axis
where it might
be
and this
is fundamental
we cannot
know
the momentum
I cannot
know the
momentum
and the
position of
a particle
to absolute
accuracy
both
the better
I know
one
the better
I know
one
the less
I will
know
the other
the less
I know
one
the better
I will
know
the other
so if
my
uncertainty
tends
to
zero
my
uncertainty
tends
to zero
in other
words
I'm
very
accurate
where this
is
if this
tends
to zero
this has
got to
tend
to
infinity
for me
to be
larger
than
even
this
smaller
number
h-bar
6.63
times 10
to the
power
negative
34
divided
by 2
pi
is
immensely
small
1.055
times 10
to the
power
negative
34
it's
immensely
small
but
if this
tends
to zero
and that
means
the area
in which
I can
discover
that I
know
exactly
where
it is
so my
probability
is getting
smaller
and smaller
my
uncertainty
is
where it
is
getting
smaller
and
smaller
that
means
this
has
got to
go
up
infinitely
and
that
is
the
probability
of
it
having
momentum
in the
x
direction
in other
words
from
zero
all
the
way
into
momentum
to
infinity
so
the
more
accurate
the
one
the
smaller
the
larger
that
one
has
gotten
here
okay
now
so
this
is
not
this
is
not
momentum
a
specific
momentum
this
is
the
probability
of
a
range
of
momentums
so
if
this
probability
gets
smaller
and
smaller
I
can
narrow
it
down
down
down
so
that
I
know
very
accurately
it
is
between
that
and
that
the
momentum
so
the
probability
of
finding
it
somewhere
it
gets
smaller
and
smaller
this
means
this
will
have
to
blow
up
as
this
tends
to
zero
this
has
to
blow
up
to
infinity
so
I
on
the
next
axis
meaning
if
I
know
very
accurately
the
momentum
of
that
particle
I
have
got
no
clue
where
it
is
it
can
be
anywhere
this
tends
to
infinity
so
we
can
only
know
the
accuracy
we
can
only
know
one
or
the
other
to
a
fair
amount
of
accuracy
then
we
lose
accuracy
on
the
other
so
this
is
what
this
equation
means
difficult
maybe
to
understand
but
if
you
see
it
in
the
light
of
this
example
you
will
remember
what
it
is
about
there
is
a
second
equation
for
the
Heisenberg
uncertainty
principle
and
that
says
probability
of
a particle
being
in a
certain
energy
state
times
the
uncertainty
of the
time
or the
time
that it
spends
in that
energy
state
4pi
is a
set
in some
textbooks
or
h-bar
in other
textbooks
let's
use an
example
where
it
is
4pi
in our
example
we
find
a
particle
that
exists
4
7.4
times
10
to
the
power
negative
20
seconds
seconds
and I
want
to
know
I
want
to
know
what
is
our
uncertainty
in the
mass
measurement
of that
particle
that
exists
for
so
long
what
is
the
and
that's
my
delta
t
so
that's
my
uncertainty
my
measurement
built
in
so
I
going
to
have
delta
e
is
going
to
equal
because
it
will
take
equal
because
it
will
be
the
minimum
h
over
4pi
divided
by
delta
t
now
delta
e
is
going
to
be
e0
there
is
going
to
be
delta
m
c
squared
so
I
can
plug
that
in
there
so
my
delta
m
c
squared
is
going
to
equal
h
divided
by
4pi
delta
t
in
other
words
the
uncertainty
in
my
mass
is
going
to
be
h
over
4pi
delta
t
c
squared
and
I
get
an
answer
for
that
of
about
7.9
times
10
to
the
power
negative
33
kilograms
so
that
would
be
the
uncertainty
in
the
mass
the
uncertainty
of
the
mass
of
the
short
lived
particle
