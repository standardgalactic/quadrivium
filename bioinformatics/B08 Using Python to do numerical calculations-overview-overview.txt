The text emphasizes using software for numerical methods instead of manual calculations, recommending spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel and programming languages like MATLAB, Python, or C#. It particularly highlights Python as a powerful option due to its extensive package ecosystem. The author plans to demonstrate using Python version 2.7.5 on Mac Mavericks, acknowledging that newer versions exist but may have compatibility issues with older add-ons.

For Windows users, it's advised to install the 32-bit version of Python on modern systems (Windows 7 or 8) as many packages are still compatible only with this version. The text underscores the convenience and efficiency gained by using programming tools for numerical computations.
