Good, now we're going to continue with our look at series and deciding whether they are convergent or divergent.
The next method we're going to look at is called the integral test.
The integral test.
Difficult to understand in most textbooks, but I want to show you what it boils down to, make it simple.
I have a series which is a sequence of partial sums from k equals 0 to infinity of 1 over k squared plus 1.
I need to know whether that is convergent or divergent and I'm going to use the integral test.
The first step in the integral test is I want to know is there some f of k, so can I write some function that equals the a of ak.
So I want to convert this into a function and if I plug in a value k, it's got to give me the same answer as the specific k that I put in there.
And indeed I can because I can say that f of x equals 1 over the x squared plus 1.
So if I put in 2 here, or if I put in k here, it is going to give me 1 over k squared plus 1, which will be the specific partial sum with that k value that I have on this side.
Now the next step, so I can write this as a function of x. That's what it boils down to.
And I think in most of the problems that you get, you know, take that for granted. You can write it as a function of x.
Next thing I need to see, so that was why I'm writing it as, next thing I need to see is this function continuous.
And it is basically continuous because I squared the, there's no way the right can get 0 in the denominator.
And there's just no way. And so this is a continuous function. So that's not a problem.
Now I need to see if it is decreasing as x goes to infinity. How do I know if a function decreases?
Well, its first derivative has got to be less than 0. So let's get the first derivative of x.
And how shall we do that? Let's do that the long way, just to remind ourselves, we can still do this.
This is a, this is a quotient, a fraction. So I'm going to let u equals 1.
And v is going to equal x squared plus 1.
u prime is going to be 0. v prime is going to be 2x.
And v squared is going to be x squared plus 1 squared.
And I know I've got to play u prime b minus u v prime divided by b squared.
So this is going to be u prime b, that's 0, minus u v prime.
So I'm going to get a negative 2x. And I'm going to get an x squared plus 1 squared.
Plus 1 squared. Now when is this going to be negative, less than 0?
Let's have a look. The only place in the denominator, I'm always going to get a positive value because I'm squared.
In the numerator, so I need, I need something less, I need a negative number.
So I need the numerator to be negative if indeed the denominator is always going to be positive.
And the only way that that's going to happen is if x is larger than 1, it's going to be less than 0 only if x is larger than 1.
Or, well, from, from, I should say, 0.
Actually, that is larger than 0 because if x is 1, this is negative. If x is 2, this is negative. So if x is larger than 0, I've got the, um, so what that boils down to is that from 0, remember, I mean, if it was negative 1, this is a positive and it actually increases.
But the function is always going to decrease as x goes to infinity. So it's always decreasing.
So I want a function that is continuous and always decreasing. If it always decreases, I can now use, so I've got these things, I can write it as a function of x.
That function is continuous and as x goes to infinity, it always decreases further, further, further. My graph always decreases. It's never going to start increasing.
So now I can use the integral test. And the integral test says, I now have to take the integral of this. So I'm taking the integral of that 1 over x squared plus 1 dx.
Okay, and I'm looking for x is larger than, I'm looking for x is larger than, than 0. So we're going from 0 to infinity of 1 over x squared plus 1 dx.
I can, uh, yes, it looks like there's still some time left. So let's do that integral. Let's just do that integral.
Now this is an integral that you should know, in as much as I use, I have to use trig substitution there. And if I look at my, let's do that the long way around as well.
I'm going to have a u squared. Now u squared is that whole term, so whatever the constant in front of us is 1. So that's x squared, in other words, u equals x.
And my a squared is this term here, which equals 1. In other words, a equals 1, because I'm using the fact that u equals a tangent of theta. Remember that?
u equals a tangent of theta, because of this denominator. So, u is x. We're going to have x equals a is 1 tangent of theta. In other words, theta equals the r tangent of x, because I need to substitute this back from the end.
I need to take the derivative of x with respect to theta. That is going to end up being sequence square of theta. And in other words, dx equals the secant square of theta d theta.
Now I can replace all of that in my integral here. So I'm going from 0 to infinity. 0 to infinity of, now, where are we? My dx now becomes secant squared theta d theta. And in the denominator, in the denominator, I just get x squared plus 1.
x squared is going to be tangent squared of x, tangent squared of x plus 1 is nothing but the secant squared of x of theta. So I'm left with just 1. So my answer here is it's going to be theta going from 0 to infinity.
But remember now, that's not how we do it. But remember now, that's not how we do it. We actually have to do the limit as r goes to infinity of 0 to r.
So on this side, I'm going to replace this theta. I'm going to replace this theta there with the r tangent of x. So I'm looking at the limit as r goes to infinity of the r tangent of x going from 0 to r.
Going from 0 to r. Going from 0 to r. Going from 0 to r. Going from 0 to r. Going from 0 to r. Now, where are we sure we carry on?
You can all do these steps. You can all do these steps in your head. You don't have to be as the borders. So I'm looking at the limit as r goes to infinity of the r tangent of r minus the r tangent of 0.
And remember that 0. Remember that 0 came from the fact that for every x equal to a larger than 0, we were going to have a decreasing function.
OK? So if I replace r with infinity there, I'm looking at the r tangent of infinity minus what is the r tangent of 0? Well, that's this 0.
So what is the r tangent of infinity? Remember that we have these asymptotes to which it goes and that is theta over 2 or 90 degrees that that r tangent here of theta is going to equal or it's going to approach theta over 2.
So that's theta over 2 divided by minus 0. That's this theta over 2. So we are actually dealing with the integral test.
So if I could write this as a function of x, if that function is continuous, and if it's always decreasing from some level down, then I can take the integral, or at least the limit as r goes to infinity of 0 to r, of this function, of this expression.
And if this converges, and if this converges, and d converged to theta over 2, that says if all of this happens and my integral converges, then my series converges.
If this is diverged, that means my series diverged.
Okay, so it's a long story, and I made it extra long because, you know, I did elementary calculus as far as doing the differentiation, doing the integration was concerned.
But I'm going to repeat this.
You can use the integral test if you can write this as a function, if that function is continuous, and if that function always decreases, okay?
And it's going to decrease, basically, from 0 to infinity, it always decreases because my first derivative is less than 0 as long as x is larger than 0.
Even if it's 0, it's 0.
So we have to use anything larger than 0.
So that means I'm taking my integral from 0 to infinity, inasmuch as that function always decreases.
From 0 to infinity, it always decreases.
And remember, we don't have to do 0 to infinity.
It's an improper integral.
So I'm taking the limit as r goes to infinity of 0 to r.
And if I do my substitutions there, I get to a finite value.
Now, so it converges, and that means my series converged.
If this diverged, that means my series would also diverge, and that is the integral test.
