The text describes a method of approximating the area under an irregular shape by dividing it into four squares. The width (base) of each square is calculated using \((b-a)/n\), where \(a\) is 0, \(b\) is 1, and \(n\) is 4, resulting in a base width (\(\Delta x\)) of \(1/4\). Upper sums are used to determine the heights of these rectangles at specific points. 

The heights are calculated at intervals: 
- The first height at \(x = 0\) (denoted as \(f(c_1)\)),
- The second height at \(x = 1/4\) (\(f(c_2)\)), and so on.

This method leads to the total area being expressed as a sum of each rectangle's area: 
\[ \text{Area} = f(c_1) \times \Delta x + f(c_2) \times \Delta x + f(c_3) \times \Delta x + f(c_4) \times \Delta x. \]

The text attempts to relate this process to real integration, using the terminology of function values at specific points (\(f(c_i)\)) and consistent base widths (\(\Delta x\)). However, there are some unclear or possibly incorrect parts towards the end that do not contribute meaningfully to the summary.
