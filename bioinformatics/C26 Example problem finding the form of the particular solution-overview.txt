The text outlines a process for finding the particular solution of a differential equation. Here is a summary:

1. **Complementary Solution**: The problem starts by identifying the complementary solution through solving the auxiliary equation \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \), which factors as \((m-1)^2 = 0\). This yields a repeated root, \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \), leading to the complementary solution: \( c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x \).

2. **Annihilator Operator**: On the right-hand side of the differential equation, an annihilator operator is determined based on the non-homogeneous term. This involves identifying parameters (\(\alpha = -2\), \(\beta = 1\)) and constructing the differential operator \( (d^2 + 4d + 5) \).

3. **Auxiliary Equation for Annihilator**: The auxiliary equation derived from combining the operators is:
   \[
   m^2 + 4m + 5 = 0
   \]
   Solving this gives roots \( m_1 = -2 + i \) and \( m_2 = -2 - i \), indicating complex conjugate solutions. Additionally, \( m_3 = m_4 = 1 \) from the repeated root in the complementary solution.

4. **Particular Solution**: The particular solution \( y_p \) is constructed using terms not already present in the homogeneous solution set:
   \[
   y_p = a e^{-2x} \cos x + b e^{-2x} \sin x
   \]
   Here, \( a \) and \( b \) are coefficients to be determined.

The text concludes by indicating that differentiation of \( y_p \) is not pursued further within this problem context. The focus was on forming the particular solution based on the identified terms.
