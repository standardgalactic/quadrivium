The text outlines a process for finding the particular solution of a differential equation. Here is a summary:

1. **Complementary Solution**: The problem starts by identifying the complementary solution through solving the auxiliary equation \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \), which factors as \((m-1)^2 = 0\). This yields a repeated root, \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \), leading to the complementary solution: \( c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x \).

2. **Annihilator Operator**: On the right-hand side of the differential equation, an annihilator operator is determined based on the non-homogeneous term. This involves identifying parameters (\(\alpha = -2\), \(\beta = 1\)) and constructing the differential operator \( (d^2 + 4d + 5) \).

3. **Auxiliary Equation for Annihilator**: The auxiliary equation derived from combining the operators is:
   \[
   m^2 + 4m + 5 = 0
   \]
   Solving this gives roots \( m_1 = -2 + i \) and \( m_2 = -2 - i \), indicating complex conjugate solutions. Additionally, \( m_3 = m_4 = 1 \) from the repeated root in the complementary solution.

4. **Particular Solution**: The particular solution \( y_p \) is constructed using terms not already present in the homogeneous solution set:
   \[
   y_p = a e^{-2x} \cos x + b e^{-2x} \sin x
   \]
   Here, \( a \) and \( b \) are coefficients to be determined.

The text concludes by indicating that differentiation of \( y_p \) is not pursued further within this problem context. The focus was on forming the particular solution based on the identified terms.

The text outlines steps for finding the particular solution of a differential equation problem. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Complementary Solution**: 
   - The complementary solution involves solving an auxiliary equation derived from the homogeneous version of the given differential equation.
   - The characteristic (auxiliary) equation provided is \( m^2 - 2m + 1 = 0 \), which factors to \( (m-1)^2 = 0 \).
   - This gives a repeated root, \( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \), leading to the complementary solution: \( y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x \).

2. **Annihilator for Particular Solution**:
   - The right-hand side of the differential equation suggests using an annihilating operator.
   - For a term like \( e^{-2x} \) (from analyzing \( \alpha = -2 \), \( \beta = 1 \)), the corresponding operator is derived as \( (D^2 + 4D + 5) \).
   - The overall differential equation becomes: \( (D-1)^2(D^2 + 4D + 5)y = 0 \).

3. **Auxiliary Equation and Roots**:
   - Combining the operators gives an auxiliary equation: \( m^4 + 2m^3 - 3m^2 - 8m - 5 = 0 \).
   - Solving this, roots are found as \( m_1 = -2 + i \), \( m_2 = -2 - i \), and the repeated root \( m_3 = m_4 = 1 \).

4. **Form of Particular Solution**:
   - Since terms like \( e^{-2x} \cos(x) \) and \( e^x, xe^x \) are part of the complementary solution, adjustments are made.
   - The particular solution \( y_p \) takes the form: 
     \[
     y_p = x(A e^{-2x} \cos(x) + B e^{-2x} \sin(x))
     \]
   - Here, \( A \) and \( B \) are coefficients to be determined.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The text stops at constructing the form of the particular solution without computing specific values for \( A \) and \( B \).

The goal was to derive the structure needed to find a particular solution, ensuring it accounts for any overlap with the complementary solution by multiplying by \( x \) where necessary.
