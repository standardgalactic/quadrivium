The text outlines the application of previously learned techniques to solve various physical problems using differential equations as mathematical models, focusing on linear differential equations. These are typically second-order with constant coefficients, where the dependent variable might be represented as \( y(t) \), \( x'(t) \), or \( x''(t) \). Such equations can model diverse systems like springs and electrical circuits, differing mainly in terminology and physical context. The discussion includes linear models addressing initial value problems and boundary value problems, with a brief overview of some non-linear models.
