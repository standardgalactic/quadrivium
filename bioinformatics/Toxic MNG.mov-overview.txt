Toxic multinodular goiter, also known as Plummer's disease, is a condition where long-standing multinodular goiters develop thyrotoxicity due to areas of autonomous function within the thyroid. This leads to subclinical and eventually overt hyperthyroidism. The exact mechanism for this change remains uncertain, but 60% of patients have TSH receptor gene mutations, with some having G-protein mutations.

Typically affecting individuals over 50 years old, especially females in iodine-deficient areas, the condition presents with less severe symptoms compared to Graves' disease, and eye or skin symptoms are rare. However, cardiovascular issues like atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and cardiac failure are common, alongside emotional disturbances.

Obstructive symptoms may occur due to retrosternal extension of nodules. Diagnosis is confirmed via ultrasound, differentiating it from single nodules or Graves' disease. Patients with a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.4 mU/L are considered subclinical hyperthyroid and require close monitoring or potential treatment to prevent progression.

For definitive therapy in overt hyperthyroidism, options include radioactive iodine ablation or thyroidectomy, alongside management with antithyroid drugs and beta-blockers for symptom control. The choice between therapies involves considering their pros and cons, with patient involvement crucial in the decision-making process. Contraindications for these treatments should be discussed further in related educational content.
