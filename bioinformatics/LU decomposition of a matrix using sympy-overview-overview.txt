The text provides a guide on how to perform LU decomposition on a matrix using Python with the SymPy library. The process involves importing the necessary functions from SymPy and setting up pretty printing for clarity. A sample 3x3 matrix is created, and LU decomposition is performed using SymPy's `lu` method, which separates the matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), without row swapping.

The main steps are:

1. Importing necessary functions from SymPy.
2. Creating a sample 3x3 matrix.
3. Using the `lu` method to perform LU decomposition, obtaining L, U, and a permutation matrix P.
4. Displaying matrices U (upper triangular with zeros below the diagonal) and L (lower triangular with ones on the diagonal).
5. Verifying the decomposition by multiplying L and U to reconstruct the original matrix.
