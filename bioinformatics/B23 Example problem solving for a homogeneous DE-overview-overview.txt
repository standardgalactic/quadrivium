The text outlines a method for solving a non-exact differential equation that initially appears exact but isn't due to unequal partial derivatives \(\frac{\partial m}{\partial y}\) and \(\frac{\partial n}{\partial x}\). Since it is not exact, the author explores using integrating factors specific to functions of \(x\) or \(y\), but neither works. The equation is then recognized as homogeneous because both functions, when transformed by \(tx\) and \(ty\), scale with \(t^2\).

To solve this, a substitution suitable for homogeneous equations is employed: either \(y = ux\) or \(x = vy\). In this case, the simpler form involves substituting \(y = ux\). This transforms the original differential equation into one involving the variable \(u\) and its derivative. The transformed equation can be manipulated to separate variables.

The text describes differentiating and simplifying expressions using substitutions, focusing on careful attention to signs and algebraic manipulation. It provides steps like differentiation, combining terms, handling negatives, and simplification until reaching an expression that isolates differentials of each variable.

For integration, the text illustrates simplifying integral expressions through algebraic techniques such as long division when direct substitution is ineffective. The solution involves expressing integrals in simpler forms with constants of integration.

The mathematical process continues by manipulating exponential expressions and employing logarithmic properties to simplify and solve equations further. It concludes with applying exponentiation to simplify complex expressions into a more manageable form, demonstrating an iterative approach to problem-solving using calculus techniques. Throughout the text, there is emphasis on methodical steps and careful algebraic manipulation to achieve simplification in solving differential equations.
