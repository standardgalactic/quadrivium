The task is to evaluate the definite integral of \(\sin(x)\) from \(0\) to \(2\pi\). The antiderivative of \(\sin(x)\) is \(-\cos(x)\). Evaluating this at the bounds:

1. Substitute \(x = 2\pi\): \(-\cos(2\pi) = -1\).
2. Substitute \(x = 0\): \(-\cos(0) = -1\).

Calculate the definite integral: 

\[
-\cos(2\pi) - (-\cos(0)) = -1 - (-1) = -1 + 1 = 0.
\]

Thus, the value of the definite integral is \(0\).
