The task is to evaluate the definite integral of \(\sin(x)\) from \(0\) to \(2\pi\). The antiderivative of \(\sin(x)\) is \(-\cos(x)\). Evaluating this at the bounds:

1. Substitute \(x = 2\pi\): \(-\cos(2\pi) = -1\).
2. Substitute \(x = 0\): \(-\cos(0) = -1\).

Calculate the definite integral: 

\[
-\cos(2\pi) - (-\cos(0)) = -1 - (-1) = -1 + 1 = 0.
\]

Thus, the value of the definite integral is \(0\).

The problem involves finding the definite integral of \(\sin(x)\) from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) with respect to \(x\), where \(x\) is measured in radians. The antiderivative of \(\sin(x)\) is \(-\cos(x)\). Evaluating this at the bounds, we get:

\[
-\cos(2\pi) - (-\cos(0)) = -1 - (-1) = -1 + 1 = 0
\]

Thus, the definite integral from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) of \(\sin(x)\) is \(0\).
