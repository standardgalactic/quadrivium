In this next video set, I want to look at what we really mean by a differential equation.
This video is about Euler's method, as you'll see in the title.
And what I can do is just teach you the, well, three basically equations of Euler's method
to solve a first-order differential equation, or to estimate a solution for it.
And I can show you some examples, but what I'd rather want to do is explain the idea behind Euler's method,
and in doing so we can also understand really what a differential equation is.
And the differential equation that I want to use is, let me write on this side, it's the following.
We have y prime equals x cubed over y.
Now, this is a separable first-order differential equation, inasmuch as I can separate the variables
on either side of the equal sign.
First, the definition, though, of a differential equation.
It says that a variable and its derivative is in the same equation.
And in the videos preceding this, we looked at examples of where that is used in real life.
In other words, the rate of change was equal to the amount at that moment.
And we looked at the growth of organisms or radioactive decaying.
That's an example of the use of a differential equation.
But now we know a differential equation does not really state x as a function of y,
but it has the derivative of one of those variables in it as well.
Now, the whole idea behind Euler's method, you're reading your textbook,
is to use it to estimate answers.
So we're going to get x and y variables.
That will be a solution.
If you can't separate the variables,
but I'm going to, for good reason, use a separable equation,
and I'm going to apply Euler's method to it,
and we'll get a better understanding.
But to be sure that that one you can solve directly,
you don't need Euler's method to solve that,
or to get solutions, specific solutions for it,
estimate specific solutions for it.
But I'm going to use that separable one for a reason.
Let's solve this in as much as we use likeness notation.
So that's dy.
I'm going to bring the other y up that side.
It's going to be x cubed dx.
I can take the indefinite integral of both sides.
I'm going to be left with a half y squared equals a quarter
x to the power 4 plus some constant c.
Let's get a bit of chalk.
Once I've done that, I can multiply it up by 2 throughout.
So I'm going to be left with y squared equals a half x to the power 4 plus 2c.
2 is a constant, c is a constant, so I'm just going to be left with a new constant.
Let's just call it c again.
I can take the square root of this to get y explicitly expressed as a function of x.
So that is going to be the square root of 1 over 2, x to the power 4 plus c.
So if I drew a graph of that, depending on what c is, I can get various graphs.
It will just be narrower.
We can clearly see that that is going to be some metabolic function.
It will be narrower or wider or up and down.
I can't think for a moment what the effect of c will be up and down, I think.
It doesn't matter.
Depending on what c is, you're going to get various hyperparabolic equations.
So there will be a family of solutions for this differential equation.
Now, for a little trick, I'm just going to let c equals 0.
So that means we're going to go from all those family of graphs.
We're going to pick one.
We're going to pick one by letting c equals 0.
It's just my choice.
So y is going to equal the square root of a half.
And then that x will come out x squared.
Or that equals square root of 2 over 2x squared, I think, if you look at it.
So that is one solution if c equals 0 to this differential equation.
Now, is that true at all?
I mean, are these two equivalent ways of writing a problem?
Well, let's have a look at it.
Let's differentiate this.
Because this is what it says.
This says dy dx.
And this is y.
So if I get the first derivative of that, it should come out to be that, shouldn't it?
Because that's a solution to that.
It's just another way of writing that, isn't it?
So let's differentiate this specific one.
So I'm going to bring the 2 in front.
The 2s will cancel.
So I'm going to be left with the square root of 2x.
Am I not?
So y prime equals the square root of 2x.
Does that look like that?
Not at all.
So what's going on here?
Well, let's use that.
y prime equals x cubed over, but we have a solution for y's.
Instead of y, I can put this.
Square root of 2 over 2.
I could have also written this.
I just, this is something that happens automatically in my mind.
Actually, this will be 1 over square root of 2 times x, wouldn't it?
I mean, that's the same way of writing it.
If I multiply this by square root of 2 over square root of 2,
it'll be square root of 2 over 2.
Okay, but let's use it.
Let's plug that in here.
So that'll be 1 over 2, square root of 2,
times x squared.
x squared.
So what will happen?
I've just replaced y, because I know now what y is.
So I'm left at y prime equals,
that will cancel, that will cancel.
1 over, we'll turn it down in the denominator,
square root of 2x.
Exactly what it is.
Exactly the first derivative of that.
So these two are equivalent.
They are equivalent.
This is indeed, this is indeed,
the first derivative of that.
No problem.
So you see now where the differential equation comes from.
These two equations, these two equations are exactly the same.
Okay, now that we know that what I've done here,
I've just plotted some points.
And so there's 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
So I've plotted some points for x and y.
But I've used this equation.
We've just shown now that this is equivalent to that.
If c is 0, we've chosen one specific of the whole family.
And I'll find your solutions for that.
So this, I have now used and I've plotted.
And let me, let me carry it on in the next video.
Here we are in the next video.
So what I've done is, I've just made a column of x and y.
x and y.
Okay, and I've let x equal 0.
So 1 over the square root of 2 times 0 is going to be 0.
So there's my first point, 0 comma 0, 0 comma 0.
Now my next point would be 1.
So put a 1 in there.
It's 1 over the square root of 2.
1 over the square root of 2.
I've written some answers on the board here
because you have to use a calculator for all of these.
It's going to be the square root of 2 over 2.
And I just want to put that in practice.
It's about 0.707, 0.707, off you go.
Now important for Euler's method,
and I'll come now to why I use Euler's method.
Euler's method, I should say.
One of my pronunciations is going today.
If your calculator gives you a whole string of digits there,
please use all of them.
The maximum that your calculator allows
because Euler's method is an estimation of the answer
of a solution.
So the more accurate you can be
by using as many digits as your calculator allows,
just do it.
It has to be done.
The more accurate your answer is going to be.
Don't use the 707 here.
It's going to be a calculator that can give you an answer
expressed as this because that will be very specific.
Square root of 2 over 2 instead of some decimal.
If I plug 2 in, if I plug 2 times 2 is 4.
4 is square root of 2.
4, where am I now?
For 2, yeah, it's 2.8.
I've got it here as well before I get too confused.
So for 2, it's 2 point...
Well, let's say that there.
It doesn't matter.
So there will be 4 over the square root of 2.
4 over the square root of 2.
And so for 2, we have about 2.8.
2.8 something, something, something.
2.8 something, something.
So I've plotted these.
I've plotted them.
And obviously, it's a square root.
So it goes on this side as well.
OK.
So just using this equation, I get to these specific ones.
And this is...
I'm not good at drawing or writing for that matter.
But anyway, so there's the curve.
OK.
From this specific one.
But now, you're not given this.
We're dealing with differential calculus here.
First order derivatives.
You're given...
First order differential equations, I should say.
You're given this.
And you need to solve it.
Now, I specifically used a separable example
because I could actually get to here by solving it.
So I can get the exact specifics.
This is exactly the answer.
It answers my honest exact curve.
Now, you're going to use Euler's method
when you have an example
where you can't separate the variables.
What if I had...
What if I had y prime equals x plus y?
You can't separate that.
I mean, you can...
That is dy dx.
I can...
What can I do?
I can say minus y equals x.
And now...
Now I have to get a common denominator of dx.
And now you're just lost.
Now you're just lost.
You can't separate these variables.
OK.
So that is the problem that I'm trying to be given to solve.
Not that one.
But I told...
I explained now that I'm using that
so that I could get to here
so that I could get a very specific...
A very specific and correct...
Absolutely correct curve.
So all my solutions lie on this curve
as far as x and y is concerned.
OK.
So let's use that now.
Y prime...
Let's make some space.
Y prime...
equals...
x cubed divided by y.
Now there are three equations in Euler's method.
What you would be asked in this problem...
Let me state it first like that.
You will be given this.
And you'll be given some initial solution.
An initial value problem.
Now we've just checked very accurately
if we choose x to be 1.
So if x is 1...
Then y equals...
We said...
Oh, now I wrote it out.
Then y equals 1...
Well, it would be 1 over the square root of 2.
1 over the square root of 2.
So you'll be told
that the y of 1
equals 1 over the square root of 2.
That's your initial value problem.
And they want to know...
We want to know
what would the y of 2
or y of 3 be.
OK.
Now, as I said,
again,
understand,
I used a separable one
so that I could say...
so that I could solve it.
So that I could plug in...
If I plug in 2 there,
it's 4 over the square root of 2.
So I know what the answer really is.
But imagine...
Imagine this was not separable.
And I couldn't solve it.
But I need to know
what the y of 2 is.
And that is where
Euler's method comes in.
It's an estimation method
of getting to answers for that.
And Euler's method
has three equations
that you should know.
It says that
x of n plus 1,
so some x
in a series,
equals xn
plus h.
And what is that h?
It's just...
If you're from...
from previous calculus,
this is delta x.
That is just the amount
that I'm going to move along.
I'm going to add
a delta x every time.
Here in...
the introduction
to differential equations,
we use h instead of delta x.
So,
if I have my x0,
these ones
that you were initially given,
we usually call 0.
So, that's my x0 value
and my y0 value.
My x1,
because 0,
0 plus 1 is 1.
So, my x1
is going to be
my previous x
plus some amount
that I move along
on the x-axis, h.
It might not make
a hell of a lot of sense now.
You'll see shortly.
y of n plus 1
is going to equal
the previous y
plus
h times
what is usually written
in textbooks
as a n.
And I'll stop this video now
before we get to the rest
and I'll explain
exactly what a n is.
you're not part of it.
I'll be right back to it.
