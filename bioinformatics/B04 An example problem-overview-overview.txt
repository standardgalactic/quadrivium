The text outlines two numerical methods for approximating solutions to the differential equation \( y' = xy \) with initial conditions \( x_0 = 1 \) and \( y_0 = 1 \): Euler's Method and an improved version known as Heun's Method.

### Euler's Method:
- **Initial Setup:** Begin at \( (x_0, y_0) = (1, 1) \).
- **Step Size (h):** A step size of 1 is chosen.
- **Iteration Process:**
  - Calculate the slope at the current point using \( f(x_n, y_n) = x_n \cdot y_n \).
  - Update \( y_{n+1} = y_n + h \times f(x_n, y_n) \) and \( x_{n+1} = x_n + h \).
  - For example:
    - At \( n = 0 \), the slope is 1. Update gives \( (x_1, y_1) = (2, 2) \).
    - At \( n = 1 \), the slope is 4. Update gives \( (x_2, y_2) = (3, 6) \).

### Improved Euler's Method (Heun's Method):
- **Initial Setup:** Same starting point as Euler's method.
- **Step Size (h):** Also uses a step size of 1.
- **Iteration Process:**
  - Calculate the initial slope \( f(x_n, y_n) \).
  - Predict a new value using Euler's method: \( y_{\text{Euler}} = y_n + h \times f(x_n, y_n) \).
  - Compute the slope at this predicted point: \( f(x_{n+1}, y_{\text{Euler}}) \).
  - Average these slopes and update:
    \[
    y_{n+1} = y_n + h \times \frac{f(x_n, y_n) + f(x_{n+1}, y_{\text{Euler}})}{2}
    \]
  - For example:
    - At \( n = 0 \), initial slope is 1. Predicted \( y_{\text{Euler}} = 2 \). Second slope at \( (2, 2) \) is 4.
    - Update: \( y_1 = 3 \).
    - At \( n = 1 \), initial slope is 6. Predicted \( y_{\text{Euler}} = 9 \). Second slope at \( (3, 9) \) is 27.
    - Update: \( y_2 = 16.5 \).

Heun's Method improves accuracy by considering both the current and predicted slopes, leading to a better approximation of the solution.
