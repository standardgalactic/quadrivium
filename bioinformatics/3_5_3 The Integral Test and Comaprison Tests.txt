Now things are going to become interesting and in the next video even more interesting.
So I have this and I can immediately see this is a p series and my p equals 3.
So I know it is divergent and I've gone through all of this. I know I can use the integral test.
I can write the f of k equals 1 over k3.
In other words, if I use the f of x equals 1 over x to the power 3 and I then take the f of k, that's going to be 1 over k to the power 3.
And that's exactly that. So I can use the f of x.
Number two is that f of x is discontinuous at 0 but I'm not concerned about the discontinuity there.
I'm more concerned as it goes to infinity and certainly for every x larger than 0 it is continuous.
I can take the first derivative of that and I can show that it is decreasing as x goes to infinity.
Then it is always going to be positive for every x equal to or larger than 1.
Now I know I can use the integral test and I've done it for the p series.
I know this thing is convergent. I know I can use that.
So I can use the statement saying 0 is less than or equal to, this remainder is less than or equal to whatever I start at.
Whatever I start at to infinity of the f of x dx.
Okay, I can use that statement now.
Now, if that is the remainder, what I'm actually saying is that's an error.
Because if I use this partial sum, I'm going to do this for the partial sum of going until k equals 100.
If I use that to estimate my true sum, my true series, I'm using this partial sum to estimate my true series,
I'm going to have a remainder left and that's going to be an error.
If I use this just to estimate, my estimation is going to be wrong.
It's going to contain an error and that error is this remainder.
So we can use this.
So let's do that.
Let's take the limit.
So if I use k equals 100.
So if I then take the limit of going from 100 to infinity and my f of x is x to the power of negative 3 dx,
that is going to be the same as the limit because now this is an improper integral still.
So the limit is r goes to infinity of 100 to r of x to the power of negative 3 dx.
What is that going to be?
Well, that's still going to be the limit.
If r goes to infinity of minus 3 plus 1 is minus 2.
So that's going to be 1 minus 2.
And x to the power of negative 2 is going from 100 to r.
Now I can rewrite this a bit better because this x is going to go, x to the power of negative 2 is going to go into the denominator.
So I can rewrite this as negative 1 over x.
Negative 1 over x, 2x squared.
I can rewrite it as that.
Let's put in these values.
So that's going to be the limit as r goes to infinity of negative 1 over 2r squared, 2r squared, minus negative 1 over 2 times 100 squared.
If I now let r go to, replace r with infinity of a, it's going to be negative 1 over 2 times infinity squared, that's 0.
The negative times the negatives are positive, so I'm going to have 1 over, 1 over 2 times 100, 100 squared, and that is 1 over 200,000.
That is going to be my error and my estimation using this partial sum as an estimate for my true series.
So that's very exciting.
It's very nice to be able to do.
But remember, we just used this as the p-series.
We know it's convergent.
It's not that we can use the integral test because it is convergent.
We're using the integral test because we went through all of those steps to see if we could use it.
It was then convergent, which means this is convergent.
And it's only when it is convergent that I now can use this statement here, this inequality there, to calculate my error.
The next video is going to be even more exciting because I'll show you, for you how to figure out how large this is going to be, to be within a certain kind of error.
So I'm going to give you this error and we've got to figure out what this n value is going to be.
Because I'm going to have a series in reality when we deal with these problems, and you're going to have to decide, you know,
where must I do the cutoff of the series so that my estimate falls within a certain acceptable value for me so that I can then use this series to do integration, differentiation on.
I mean, we'll get to all of those things.
Okay.
Now it's going to get serious fun.
This is seriously fun.
It is so good.
I have my series now.
k equals 1 to infinity of 1 over k to the power of 3.
And I know this is a p series.
And then p equals 3.
So it is convergent.
I know, because I've done it before, but you're not going to just get this in the exam or in real life.
You're going to get something that you physically have to see.
Can I use?
Can I use the integral test?
Going through all those steps.
Does it converge?
Yes, it converges.
Now I can say is smaller than r of n, is smaller than the integral of n to infinity of f of x dx.
Okay.
Now, I want to know what must the value of n be so that my error is no more than, for this one,
my error is no more than 1 over 200,000.
I'm just using the previous problem in reverse, but you'll see.
Okay.
It's a word sum.
That means I don't plug this in there.
Listen to what I'm saying.
I am saying, I am saying, my error must be no larger than this.
In other words, what I'm saying is my going from n to infinity of the f of x dx is going to be no larger than 1 over 200,000.
Okay.
That's what I'm saying.
So when you have to estimate what n has got to be, now remember it said less than or equal to.
So in your mind's eye, see this as equal to that.
Now this equals sign, but I actually want it to be less than.
The word sum tells you.
I want to know what was this n value be.
In other words, what partial sum can I use of my series so that I don't make an error larger than a certain number.
So this has got to be less than that error.
Please, please, please.
So this is going to become the limit as r goes to infinity.
It's still in the proper integral of n to r of the f of x, which is 1 over x to the power 3 dx.
Okay.
Now, what is that going to be?
And that must be less than 1 over 200,000.
Less than 1 over 200,000.
My error.
But I don't want to go beyond.
So this is going to be the limit as r goes to infinity of, what is this going to be?
Star minus 1 over 2x squared.
Going from n to r, and then it's still going to be less than 1 over 200,000.
Okay.
If I put these values in here, what is going to happen?
I'm going to get the limit.
Let's do it the long way.
But you can do all of this in your head.
As long as you don't make a mistake.
1 over 2r squared minus negative 1 over 2n squared.
Less than or equal to 1 over 200,000.
If I plug r in there, squared, this becomes 0.
Negative times negative is a positive.
So I'm left with 1 over 2n squared.
It's going to be less than or equal to 1 over 200,000.
Now I can just bring this up.
That's a positive.
The sign doesn't change.
I can bring that there.
My n is always going to be a positive.
I'm looking for between 1 and infinity.
So that's always positive.
So I'm going to be 200,000 is going to be less than or equal to 2n squared.
I'm going to do that as a 1 and that goes away.
In other words, n has got to be more than or equal to the square root of 100,000, which is 100.
So I need to partial sum of at least 100 to give me as a maximum of this error.
And that's a very nice thing to be able to do.
I can say in my experiment that I'm doing, whatever, this is the maximum error that I can allow.
What must my partial sum be, my estimate of the true series, which I have to stop at before I become as accurate as I want to be.
