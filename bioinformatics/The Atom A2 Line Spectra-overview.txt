The text discusses the concept of line spectra, specifically in relation to atomic hydrogen. It begins by noting that all physical objects emit electromagnetic radiation across various wavelengths. However, when focusing on single atoms, such as hydrogen, they emit distinct spectral lines instead of a continuous spectrum.

When hydrogen gas is subjected to high voltage in a vacuum tube and its emitted light is passed through a diffraction grating, it produces line spectra. These are specific wavelengths unique to the atomic transitions within hydrogen. The text explains that these lines form series: the Lyman series (ultraviolet), Balmer series (visible), and Paschen series (infrared).

Each series corresponds to different values of an integer \( N \) in the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{N^2} \right)
\]

where \( R \) is the Rydberg constant, and \( n_1 \) is a fixed integer specific to each series (1 for Lyman, 2 for Balmer, 3 for Paschen).

In the visible spectrum's Balmer series (\( n_1 = 2 \)), the smallest wavelength occurs when \( N \to \infty \), yielding approximately 365 nanometers. Conversely, the largest wavelength corresponds to the smallest \( N \) value (3), resulting in about 656 nanometers. These calculations illustrate how specific wavelengths are determined by quantum transitions within hydrogen atoms.
