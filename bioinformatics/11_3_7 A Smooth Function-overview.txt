The text discusses concepts related to multivariable calculus, focusing on differentiability and continuity of functions. Key points include:

1. **Differentiability Implies Continuity**: A multi-variable equation being differentiable implies it is continuous at that point, but continuity does not necessarily imply differentiability.

2. **Non-Differentiable Points**: Examples are given where a function can be continuous (like at a sharp point or cusp) yet not differentiable because the derivative does not exist there.

3. **Conditions for Differentiability in Multivariable Functions**:
   - The gradient of the function must exist.
   - Using this, one can derive the equation for a tangent plane and determine if the function is differentiable by evaluating certain limits.
   - A simpler criterion states that if the gradient exists and is continuous at a point, the function is differentiable there.

4. **Smooth Functions**: A smooth (or \( C^1 \)) function has all partial derivatives defined and continuous across its domain, ensuring it is differentiable everywhere within that domain.

The essence of these concepts emphasizes understanding when functions are smoothly transitioning versus having sharp changes or points where their behavior is more complex.

The text explains concepts from multivariable calculus concerning continuity, differentiability, and smoothness of functions. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Differentiability Implies Continuity**: If a multi-variable equation is differentiable at a point, it implies the function is continuous there. However, continuity alone does not guarantee differentiability.

2. **Continuity vs. Differentiability**: A function can be continuous without being differentiable at certain points. An example given is a sharp point on a three-dimensional surface where the limit exists and matches the function value (continuous), but no tangent plane (non-differentiable) can be defined there.

3. **Differentiability Conditions in Multivariable Calculus**: For a multivariable function to be differentiable at a point, its gradient must exist at that point, allowing for the construction of a tangent plane. The limit condition involving the difference between the function value and the tangent plane, normalized by distance, approaching zero is essential.

4. **Gradient and Differentiability**: If the gradient of a function exists and is continuous at a point, then the function is differentiable there.

5. **Smooth Functions (C1 Functions)**: A function is considered smooth or \( C^1 \) if all its partial derivatives are defined and continuous throughout its domain. This implies that the function is not only differentiable but also has a continuously varying gradient across the entire domain, ensuring differentiability at every point.

The text emphasizes understanding these relationships to determine when functions exhibit certain calculus properties like continuity and differentiability.
