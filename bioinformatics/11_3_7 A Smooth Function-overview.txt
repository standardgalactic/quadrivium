The text discusses concepts related to multivariable calculus, focusing on differentiability and continuity of functions. Key points include:

1. **Differentiability Implies Continuity**: A multi-variable equation being differentiable implies it is continuous at that point, but continuity does not necessarily imply differentiability.

2. **Non-Differentiable Points**: Examples are given where a function can be continuous (like at a sharp point or cusp) yet not differentiable because the derivative does not exist there.

3. **Conditions for Differentiability in Multivariable Functions**:
   - The gradient of the function must exist.
   - Using this, one can derive the equation for a tangent plane and determine if the function is differentiable by evaluating certain limits.
   - A simpler criterion states that if the gradient exists and is continuous at a point, the function is differentiable there.

4. **Smooth Functions**: A smooth (or \( C^1 \)) function has all partial derivatives defined and continuous across its domain, ensuring it is differentiable everywhere within that domain.

The essence of these concepts emphasizes understanding when functions are smoothly transitioning versus having sharp changes or points where their behavior is more complex.
