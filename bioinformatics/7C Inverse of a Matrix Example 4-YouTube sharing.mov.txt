I think you know what is going to happen here and we're going to end up with a new rule.
So the determinant of A is going to be AD minus BC.
In this case it's going to be 7 times 0, which is 0, minus 9 times 0, which is also 0.
So our new rule is going to say if there's a whole row, previously we had a column of zeros,
because if there's a whole row of zeros, we know that this is going to be a singular matrix.
