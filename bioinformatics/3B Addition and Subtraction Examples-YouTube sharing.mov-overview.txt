The text provides instructions on how to perform basic matrix operations—addition and subtraction—between two matrices, A and B, both of which are 3x3 in size. It emphasizes that addition and subtraction can only occur if the matrices are of equal dimensions.

1. **Matrix Addition (A + B):** 
   - Elements at corresponding positions (addresses) in matrices A and B are added together.
   - Example: For position I=1, J=1 (first row, first column), 3 + (-3) = 0.

2. **Matrix Subtraction (A - B):**
   - Elements at corresponding positions in matrix A are subtracted by elements in matrix B.
   - Example: For position I=1, J=1, 3 - (-3) = 6.

3. **Subtraction of Matrix A from B (B - A):**
   - Similar to subtraction but performed as B minus A.
   - Example: For position I=1, J=1, (-3) - 3 = -6.

The text advises keeping track of the matrix positions and ensuring matrices are of the same size for these operations.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of how to perform matrix addition and subtraction on two given 3x3 matrices, A and B. It emphasizes that these operations are only possible if both matrices are of equal size, which is the case here.

1. **Matrix Addition (A + B):** To add two matrices, you simply sum the corresponding elements from each matrix. For example, for row 1, column 1, you add \(3\) from matrix A to \(-3\) from matrix B resulting in \(0\). The process continues across all corresponding elements.

2. **Matrix Subtraction (A - B):** Subtracting matrices involves subtracting the elements of one matrix from the corresponding elements of another. For instance, for row 1, column 1, you calculate \(3 - (-3)\) which equals \(6\). This is repeated for all element pairs.

3. **Matrix Subtraction (B - A):** This is similar to adding a negative version of the first matrix to the second. The subtraction follows the same principle as above but in reverse order; for example, \(-3 - 3\) results in \(-6\).

The text concludes by reminding that addition and subtraction of matrices are straightforward if both matrices have the same dimensions, and it involves working with corresponding elements.
