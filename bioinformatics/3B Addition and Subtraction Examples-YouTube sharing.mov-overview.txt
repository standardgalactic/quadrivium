The text provides instructions on how to perform basic matrix operations—addition and subtraction—between two matrices, A and B, both of which are 3x3 in size. It emphasizes that addition and subtraction can only occur if the matrices are of equal dimensions.

1. **Matrix Addition (A + B):** 
   - Elements at corresponding positions (addresses) in matrices A and B are added together.
   - Example: For position I=1, J=1 (first row, first column), 3 + (-3) = 0.

2. **Matrix Subtraction (A - B):**
   - Elements at corresponding positions in matrix A are subtracted by elements in matrix B.
   - Example: For position I=1, J=1, 3 - (-3) = 6.

3. **Subtraction of Matrix A from B (B - A):**
   - Similar to subtraction but performed as B minus A.
   - Example: For position I=1, J=1, (-3) - 3 = -6.

The text advises keeping track of the matrix positions and ensuring matrices are of the same size for these operations.
