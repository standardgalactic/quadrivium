Now let's just have a look at commutivity. Now remember what I said it's not part of the
definition of groups but you might find that in some groups some elements or elements do commute.
So let's just look at that. So that'll be a special kind of group it's definitely not true
for groups in general. So we have this statement we're going to let AB equals BA for all AB
elements of some group under multiplication group G under multiplication and we say if this is true
if this is true show that the inverses of A and B also commute. So the proof for this actually would
be just very easy. We are given yes we can write that that's given the fact that AB equals BA and
what can we do? Well let's start bringing things let's start bringing things this way. So I can
put a B inverse on that side so B inverse this is AB so B inverse B that's this E and I have an A I can
bring A inverse this side so I have A inverse B inverse AB that equals E because I put an A inverse
there. Now let's take the B inverse to that side so A inverse B inverse A equals I've got a B inverse
there which makes this E so I've got a B inverse on this side eventually at the end I'll take an A
inverse on both sides so I have A inverse B inverse equals B inverse A inverse so as simple as that
as simple as that so if we do have this commutative property of commutivity for this very special group
then the inverses of these two will also commute. So in this instance let's have a look same thing
as holding here I'm saying that there is in the special group of mine G this is this commutivity just
show that A B and A would commute well it's given it's definitely given that A B equals B A
and I can just put an A on A on both sides at the front so A and A B equals A and B A and all I have
to do now this is a group so I do have this this associativity so I can say that these two and those
two and then behold A and A B commutes because I have A and A B equals A B and A so that's an easy one
still with this very special group of mine let's just show that A squared and B would commute so we're
going to say given A B equals B A I can put A in the front so I'll have A B A B equals A B A
and we know that A B equals B A so I can say A squared B equals B A A associativity there A B
A B is B A so I can swap those two rounds so I have the fact that A squared B equals B A squared
and they commute as well so let's have a look at this one slightly more interesting I want you need to
now show that A squared and B squared commute so given that A B equals B A I can say that A squared B
oh B A equals A B A it's putting an A in the front let's put a B in the back I have A squared B
squared equals A B A B not exactly what I want but we can do association A B equals B A so that is going to
be B A B A with another A is A squared B and we've just shown that that B squared and A squared that A
squared and B squared commute so those two commute we've just shown that so we're going to have that
B squared A squared as I turn those two around so I have A squared B squared equals B squared A squared
B squared okay we've added another special one and we've added x there so A B and x are element of this
very special group and I still have this the property for this special group that we do have this
commutivity and I'm asked to do that so given you have to think about this one a bit and of course you've
got to be got to be slightly creative let's have A B x inverse and let's have that and do exactly the
same on this side A B x inverse so I'm not using a special property here but what is there is exactly
there nothing nothing different I do know though that A B x inverse that equals x associativity B A x
inverse and now I can just bring in my identity and I know that x x inverse equals the identity element
because this is a group and so let's just bring E in I'm going to bring E in right there in this form
so I'm going to have x it's not squared there I don't know why I have that there and anyway x A
let's have x inverse x which is this E B x inverse and that's going to be x and I'm going to bring E in
right there so I'm going to have x let's see we're going to have x of B x inverse x A x inverse and now
I'm just going to use associativity oops there and there so in other words x A x inverse that's one
and x B x inverse that is going to be x B x inverse x A x inverse and we see that they commute so just a
little bit of creativity and you won't just get it the first time except if they if they're quite easy and
of course if you're terribly smart but sit around and play with them and it doesn't take too long
if you use a bit of creativity and you play around and these are actually quite a bit of fun to do
