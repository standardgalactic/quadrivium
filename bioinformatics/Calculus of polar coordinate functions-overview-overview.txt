To solve the problem of finding where the slope of the polar coordinate function \( r = \sin(3\theta) \) is horizontal, we need to identify where the derivative with respect to \(\theta\) equals zero. Here's a structured summary and solution:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Curve Definition**: The curve is defined by the polar equation \( r = \sin(3\theta) \).

2. **Objective**:
   - Identify points where the tangent line is horizontal, i.e., where the slope of the function in Cartesian coordinates is zero.

### Derivative Calculation

To find where the tangent line is horizontal:

1. **Convert Polar to Cartesian Coordinates**:
   - \( x = r \cos(\theta) = \sin(3\theta) \cos(\theta) \)
   - \( y = r \sin(\theta) = \sin(3\theta) \sin(\theta) \)

2. **Find Derivatives Using the Product Rule**:
   - For \( y \):
     \[
     \frac{dy}{d\theta} = 3\cos(3\theta)\sin(\theta) + \sin(3\theta)\cos(\theta)
     \]
   - For \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{dx}{d\theta} = 3\cos(3\theta)\cos(\theta) - \sin(3\theta)\sin(\theta)
     \]

3. **Slope of the Tangent Line**:
   - The slope in Cartesian coordinates is given by:
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{d\theta}}{\frac{dx}{d\theta}}
     \]

4. **Condition for Horizontal Tangents**:
   - Set the numerator of the slope to zero for horizontal tangents:
     \[
     3\cos(3\theta)\sin(\theta) + \sin(3\theta)\cos(\theta) = 0
     \]

### Solving the Equation

To find where this expression equals zero:

1. **Factor and Solve**:
   - The equation can be factored as:
     \[
     \sin(\theta)(3\cos(3\theta)) + \cos(\theta)(\sin(3\theta)) = 0
     \]

2. **Set Each Factor to Zero**:
   - \( \sin(\theta) = 0 \)
     - Solutions: \(\theta = n\pi\) where \(n\) is an integer.
   - \( 3\cos(3\theta) + \cot(\theta)\sin(3\theta) = 0 \)

3. **Solve for Specific \(\theta\)**:
   - From \( \sin(\theta) = 0 \), \(\theta = n\pi\).
   - For the second part, solve:
     \[
     3\cos(3\theta) + \cot(\theta)\sin(3\theta) = 0
     \]
     - Rearrange and find specific values of \(\theta\).

### Conclusion

The solutions to these equations give you the angles \(\theta\) where the slope is horizontal. Substitute these \(\theta\) values back into \( r = \sin(3\theta) \) to find the corresponding polar coordinates, and convert them to Cartesian coordinates if needed.

These points are where the tangent line to the curve is horizontal.

The text provides a summary of calculations for points on a polar curve and their corresponding tangent line slopes. Here’s a breakdown:

### Key Points

1. **Coordinates for Specific Angles:**
   - For \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\): \( r = 1\), coordinates are \((x, y) = (\sqrt{3}/2, 1/2)\).
   - For \(\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}\): \( r = 1\), coordinates are \((x, y) = (-\sqrt{3}/2, 1/2)\).
   - For \(\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}\): \( r = 1\), coordinates are \((x, y) = (0, -1)\).

2. **Slope of the Tangent Line (\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)) Calculation:**
   The slope in polar coordinates is given by:

   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dr}{d\theta} \sin(\theta) + r \cos(\theta)}{\frac{dr}{d\theta} \cos(\theta) - r \sin(\theta)}
   \]

   where \(\frac{dr}{d\theta} = 3 \cos(3\theta)\).

3. **Slope Calculations for Each Angle:**
   - For \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\): The slope is \(-\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}\).
   - For \(\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}\): The slope is \(\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{6}\).
   - For \(\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}\): The slope is \(0\).

### Conclusion

- **Maximum Points:** These are the points where the radius \( r \) reaches its maximum value for given angles, specifically at \((\sqrt{3}/2, 1/2)\), \((- \sqrt{3}/2, 1/2)\), and \((0, -1)\).
- **Slopes of Tangent Lines:**
  - At \((\sqrt{3}/2, 1/2)\): Slope is \(-\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}\).
  - At \((- \sqrt{3}/2, 1/2)\): Slope is \(\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{6}\).
  - At \((0, -1)\): Slope is \(0\).

These results indicate the slopes of tangent lines at points where the radius is maximized for specific angles on a polar curve. The text also mentions the process for finding horizontal tangents in parametric curves by setting \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\).

The text discusses finding horizontal tangents for a curve defined in polar coordinates and calculating the area enclosed by such a curve. Here's a summary:

1. **Derivative Calculation**: 
   - The derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) is given as \(\frac{dy}{dx} = -\cot(\theta)\).

2. **Horizontal Tangents**:
   - Horizontal tangents occur when \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\), which implies \(\cot(\theta) = 0\). This happens at \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi\) for \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\).
   - The condition \(\sin(\theta) \neq 0\) ensures the denominator in the derivative is non-zero.

3. **Specific Values**:
   - For \(\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \ldots\), the tangents are horizontal.
   - An example point for \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}\) is given by coordinates \(x = \frac{r}{2}\) and \(y = \frac{r\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

4. **Expressing \(\sin^2(\alpha)\)**:
   - The identity \(\sin^2(\alpha) = \frac{1 - \cos(2\alpha)}{2}\) is used to simplify expressions involving squared sine functions.

5. **Application**:
   - For \(r = \sin(3\theta)\), the expression becomes \(r^2 = 9\sin^2(3\theta) = \frac{9}{2}(1 - \cos(6\theta))\).

6. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area enclosed by the curve from \(\theta = 0\) to \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}\) is calculated using the integral:

     \[
     A = \frac{9}{4} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{3}} (1 - \cos(6\theta)) \, d\theta
     \]

This process involves setting up and evaluating an integral to find the area of a region defined by a polar curve.

The text provides a detailed explanation for calculating the area of specific regions defined by polar curves. Here's a summary:

### Solving the Integral for a Rose Curve Petal

1. **Integral Setup**: The area \( A \) is calculated using:
   \[
   A = \frac{9}{4} \left( \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{3}} 1 \, d\theta - \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{3}} \cos(6\theta) \, d\theta \right)
   \]

2. **Calculation**:
   - The first integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).
   - The second integral evaluates to \(0\) because \(\sin(2\pi) = \sin(0) = 0\).

3. **Result**: 
   - The area for one petal is initially calculated as \(\frac{3\pi}{4}\), but considering symmetry and the specific interval, it simplifies to \(\frac{\pi}{12}\).

### Finding the Area of the Inner Loop of a Limaçon

1. **Identify the Inner Loop**:
   - The limaçon \( r = 1 + 2\cos(\theta) \) has an inner loop where \( r = 0 \).
   - Solving \( 1 + 2\cos(\theta) = 0 \) gives \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) and \(\theta = \frac{4\pi}{3}\).

2. **Integral Setup**:
   - The area \( A \) is given by:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\frac{2\pi}{3}}^{\frac{4\pi}{3}} r^2 \, d\theta
     \]
   - With \( r^2 = (1 + 2\cos(\theta))^2 = 3 + 4\cos(\theta) + 2\cos(2\theta) \).

3. **Evaluate the Integral**:
   - Split into three parts: \(\int 3 \, d\theta\), \(\int 4\cos(\theta) \, d\theta\), and \(\int 2\cos(2\theta) \, d\theta\).
   - Calculate each integral over the interval \([\frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{3}]\).

This approach provides a structured method to find areas enclosed by polar curves, specifically focusing on rose curve petals and limaçon inner loops.

To find the area of one petal of the polar curve \( r = \sin(2\theta) \), we use the formula for the area enclosed by a polar curve:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} [r(\theta)]^2 \, d\theta
\]

For the given curve \( r = \sin(2\theta) \), we determine the bounds for one petal. The petals occur when \( \sin(2\theta) = 0 \), which happens at \( 2\theta = n\pi \). Thus, the zeros are at \( \theta = 0, \frac{\pi}{2}, \pi, \ldots \).

A single petal is formed between two consecutive zeros of \( r \). For example, between \( \theta = 0 \) and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \), the curve completes one petal.

Calculate the area of one petal:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} [\sin(2\theta)]^2 \, d\theta
\]

Use the trigonometric identity for \( \sin^2(x) \):

\[
\sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2}
\]

Apply this to \( x = 2\theta \):

\[
[\sin(2\theta)]^2 = \frac{1 - \cos(4\theta)}{2}
\]

Substitute into the integral:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1 - \cos(4\theta)}{2} \, d\theta
\]

Simplify:

\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (1 - \cos(4\theta)) \, d\theta
\]

Separate the integrals:

\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \left[ \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 1 \, d\theta - \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(4\theta) \, d\theta \right]
\]

Calculate each integral:

1. \(\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 1 \, d\theta = \left[\theta\right]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{\pi}{2}\)

2. \(\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(4\theta) \, d\theta = \left[\frac{\sin(4\theta)}{4}\right]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \left[\sin(4\theta)\right]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\)

   Evaluate:

   \(\sin(4 \times \frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(2\pi) = 0\) and \(\sin(0) = 0\).

   Thus, the integral evaluates to \( \frac{1}{4} (0 - 0) = 0 \).

Substitute back:

\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 0 \right) = \frac{\pi}{8}
\]

Therefore, the area of one petal is \( \frac{\pi}{8} \).

The text provides a detailed explanation of calculating areas using integrals in polar coordinates, specifically focusing on two problems.

### Problem Breakdown:

#### Problem 1: Area of One Petal

- **Integral Setup**: The area \( A \) is given by:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{4} \left( \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 1 \, d\theta - \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(4\theta) \, d\theta \right)
  \]

- **Calculations**:
  1. Calculate \(\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 1 \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\).
  2. Calculate \(\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(4\theta) \, d\theta = 0\).

- **Substitute and Solve**:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 0 \right) = \frac{\pi}{8}
  \]
  
- **Conclusion**: The area of one petal is \(\frac{\pi}{8}\).

#### Problem 2: Area Inside \( r = \cos^2(\theta/2) \)

- **Trigonometric Identity**:
  \[
  \cos^2(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(2x)
  \]
  Applied to \( \cos^2(\theta/2) \):
  \[
  \cos^2(\theta/2) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta)
  \]

- **Square the Function**:
  \[
  (\cos^2(\theta/2))^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta)\right)^2
  \]
  Expand and simplify using identities.

- **Integral for Area**:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta) + \frac{1}{8}\cos(2\theta)\right) d\theta
  \]

- **Integration**:
  - \(\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{3}{8} \, d\theta = \frac{3\pi}{4}\)
  - \(\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta) \, d\theta = 0\)
  - \(\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{8}\cos(2\theta) \, d\theta = 0\)

- **Total Area**:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{3\pi}{8}
  \]

#### Problem 2.9: Area Inside \( r = 1 + \cos(\theta) \) and Outside \( r = 1 \)

- **Objective**: Find the area inside the cardioid \( r = 1 + \cos(\theta) \) but outside the circle \( r = 1 \).

- **Intersection Points**:
  - Solve \( 1 + \cos(\theta) = 1 \).
  - This simplifies to \( \cos(\theta) = 0 \), giving intersection angles \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{2} \).

The text outlines the process of setting up integrals, using trigonometric identities, solving for intersections, and calculating areas in polar coordinates.

The provided text describes a mathematical problem involving finding the area between two curves in polar coordinates: a cardioid \( r = 1 + \cos(\theta) \) and a circle \( r = 1 \). The solution involves several steps:

1. **Determine Limits of Integration:** Since the region is symmetric about the x-axis, integration is performed from \(0\) to \(\pi\).

2. **Set Up the Integral:** Using the formula for area in polar coordinates:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} (r_1^2 - r_2^2) \, d\theta
   \]
   where \( r_1 = 1 + \cos(\theta) \) and \( r_2 = 1 \).

3. **Calculate the Integral:**
   \[
   A = \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{1}{2} \left((1 + \cos(\theta))^2 - 1\right) \, d\theta
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   = \int_{0}^{\pi} \left(\cos(\theta) + \frac{1}{4}(1 + \cos(2\theta))\right) \, d\theta
   \]

4. **Integrate:**
   - Integrate term by term:
     \[
     A = \left[\sin(\theta) + \frac{1}{4}\theta + \frac{1}{8}\sin(2\theta)\right]_{0}^{\pi}
     \]
   - Evaluate to find:
     \[
     A = \frac{\pi}{4}
     \]

5. **Account for Symmetry:** Multiply by 2 due to symmetry about the x-axis:
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

The conclusion is that the area inside the cardioid and outside the circle is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Additionally, the text mentions a calculus concept: the integral of \(\sec^2(x)\) with respect to \(x\) is \(\tan(x)\). This is a standard result in calculus for solving integrals involving trigonometric functions. The text concludes informally with "See ya'll soon," indicating it might be part of a casual discussion or explanation.
