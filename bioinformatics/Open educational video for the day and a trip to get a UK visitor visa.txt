Another day, another fantastic run here in Newlands Forest.
Well, the day started off pretty good. I had to go locally to apply for my British travel visa
here in Cape Town. I don't know if one is allowed to talk about these things. If not, let me know.
Just to confirm that that was a fantastically run operation there. Everyone knew what they were doing.
I did pay the extra amount just to go to the premium lounge and have someone personally look
at all my documents in the application. And I must really compliment the local service here.
You know, applying for a British visa was really probably the best experience I've had applying
for a visa. So if you have to go for a British tourist visa here in Cape Town, no problems
whatsoever. For the educational videos, watch out for a video on abstract algebra. I look
at the kernel of a group and that's a very special, a very special subgroup. That's a normal subgroup
as well that allows us to create a very special set of cosets. And from there, we are going
to look at the first theorem of isomorphisms. See you again later.
