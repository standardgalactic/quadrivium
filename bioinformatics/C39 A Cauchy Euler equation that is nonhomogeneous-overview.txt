The text outlines the steps for solving non-homogeneous differential equations using the method of variation of parameters. Here's a summary:

1. **Transform to Homogeneous**: Start by setting \( g(x) = 0 \) in the given equation, converting it into a homogeneous form and solve as previously learned.

2. **Complementary Solution**: Solve the resulting homogeneous equation to find the complementary solutions \( y_1, y_2, \ldots \).

3. **Variation of Parameters**: Use these complementary solutions to apply variation of parameters:
   - Ensure that \( f(x) \) (not \( g(x) \)) is on the right-hand side in standard form.
   - Divide by the leading non-constant coefficient if necessary.

4. **Calculate Integrals**:
   - Compute the Wronskian using \( y_1, y_2, \ldots \) and their derivatives.
   - Use integrals to find particular solutions: 
     \[
     u_1 = \int \frac{-y_2 f(x)}{\text{Wronskian}} \, dx
     \]
   - Similarly for \( u_2 \), using appropriate expressions.

5. **Combine Solutions**: Add the complementary and particular solutions to obtain the general solution of the non-homogeneous equation.
