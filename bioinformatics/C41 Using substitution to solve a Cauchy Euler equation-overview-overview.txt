The text describes a method for solving differential equations with non-constant coefficients using logarithmic transformation. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Logarithmic Substitution**: Transform the independent variable \( x \) into \( t = \ln(x) \), leveraging the relationship between exponentials and natural logarithms.

2. **Equation Transformation**: Rewrite terms like \( x^m \) as \( e^{m \ln(x)} = e^{mt} \). This changes the equation to one in terms of \( t \), simplifying non-constant coefficients.

3. **Derivative Conversion via Chain Rule**:
   - First derivative: \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dt} \)
   - Second derivative: 
     \[
     \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{1}{x^2} \left( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \frac{dy}{dt} \right)
     \]

4. **Solving the New Equation**: The transformed equation, now in terms of \( t \), can be addressed using standard methods for equations with constant coefficients.

5. **Broad Applicability**: This technique is suitable for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous differential equations.

The text indicates that an example will follow to demonstrate this method.
