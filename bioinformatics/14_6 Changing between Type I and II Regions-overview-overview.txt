The text outlines a method for calculating the volume above a region in the xy-plane bounded by two curves: \( y = x \) and \( y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 \). The height function is given as \( f(x, y) = 3xy \). This calculation involves setting up double integrals over the defined region using both Type 1 and Type 2 regions.

### Key Steps:

1. **Intersection Points**: 
   - Solve \( y = x \) and \( y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 \) to find intersection points, which occur at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 2 \).

2. **Type 1 Region**:
   - Use the differential area element \( dy\,dx \).
   - \( x \) ranges from 0 to 2.
   - For a fixed \( x \), \( y \) varies from \( \frac{1}{2}x^2 \) to \( x \).
   - Integral setup:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{2} \left( \int_{\frac{1}{2}x^2}^{x} 3xy \, dy \right) dx
     \]

3. **Type 2 Region**:
   - Use the differential area element \( dx\,dy \).
   - \( y \) ranges from 0 to 2.
   - For a fixed \( y \), \( x \) varies from \( y \) to \( \sqrt{2y} \).
   - Integral setup:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{2} \left( \int_{y}^{\sqrt{2y}} 3xy \, dx \right) dy
     \]

### Verification and Theorem:

- Both integrals should yield the same volume due to Fubini's theorem, which allows changing the order of integration.
- Calculations confirm both integrals result in a volume of 4 units.

### Important Considerations:

- Correctly express functions as dependent or independent variables when switching between Type 1 and Type 2 regions.
- Adjust limits and expressions appropriately when changing the order of integration.
- The process involves algebraic manipulation, integration, and substitution to verify equivalence.

The text emphasizes the importance of accurately setting up integrals for different types of regions and ensuring consistency in results through proper variable adjustments.
