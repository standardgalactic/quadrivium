The text discusses how parametric equations can transform the representation of curves from static shapes to dynamic paths. Here's a summary focusing on the main ideas:

1. **Parametrization Basics**: The process involves expressing a curve using parameters, such as \( x = t - 1 \) and \( y = t^3 + 2 \). This allows viewing an equation like \( y = x^2 + 3 \) in parametric form (\( x = t \), \( y = t^2 + 3 \)).

2. **Parametrization as a Path**: By using parameters, curves are seen not just as static equations but as paths or trajectories that change with the parameter (often interpreted as time). This can convert an equation into a vector function representing movement along the curve.

3. **Finding Tangents Using Parametric Form**:
   - Convert parametric forms back to polynomial if needed.
   - Use derivatives of the parametric form to find tangents. For example, given \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t-1, t^3+2) \), compute the derivative \( \mathbf{r}'(t) = (1, 3t^2) \).
   - Determine where on the curve a specific point lies by solving for the parameter. For example, finding \( t \) when \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 3 \).

4. **Equation of Tangent Line**: At a given point (e.g., (0, 3)), use the derivative to find the tangent's direction vector. Construct the tangent line equation using the point and direction vector: 
   - The general form is \( \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{r}_0 + t\mathbf{v} \), where \( \mathbf{r}_0 \) is the point of tangency, and \( \mathbf{v} \) is the direction vector derived from the derivative.

5. **Interpreting as Linear Algebra**: This method aligns with linear algebra concepts, where a tangent line can be seen as moving through a point along a specific direction (parallel vector).

Overall, parametric equations offer a dynamic way to analyze and describe curves, facilitating calculations like finding tangents by viewing them as paths traced over time.

The text provides examples of vector function differentiation. It begins by explaining how to find the slope (first derivative) of a vector function, which results in another vector that is parallel to the original but passes through a given point.

In the second example, it discusses differentiating each component of a vector function individually using techniques learned in first-year calculus. The components are given as functions involving trigonometric expressions: cosine squared and sine squared for x, y, and z coordinates over a closed interval \(0 \leq t \leq 4\pi\).

The differentiation process yields velocity from the position vector (first derivative) and acceleration from the second derivative. To find speed, one takes the norm of the velocity vector.

Finally, it addresses continuity on the given domain. For a function to be continuous, its first derivative must exist across the closed interval \(0 \leq t \leq 4\pi\) and not equal the zero vector within the open interval \(0 < t < 4\pi\). In this example, due to instances where the components become zero (e.g., cosine of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)), the function is identified as piecewise rather than continuous over the domain.
