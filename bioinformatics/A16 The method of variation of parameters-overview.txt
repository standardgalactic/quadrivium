The text discusses solving systems of non-homogeneous linear differential equations using the method of variation of parameters. This approach is preferred over undetermined coefficients when the latter doesn't work effectively.

1. **Preliminary Work**: Before finding a particular solution, one must first determine the complementary solution by setting \( f(t) = 0 \), solving \( x' = Ax \). 

2. **Fundamental Matrix**: The fundamental matrix is crucial in this method. It involves forming an n-by-n matrix (\(\Phi(t)\)) using solutions of the homogeneous system (eigenvectors scaled by exponentials involving eigenvalues).

3. **Structure**:
   - Solutions are expressed as \( x = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \ldots + c_nx_n \), where each \( x_i \) is a solution of the homogeneous system.
   - These solutions can be organized into a matrix form, \(\Phi(t)\), with columns representing individual solutions.

4. **Properties**:
   - The determinant (Wronskian) of \(\Phi(t)\) must be non-zero for it to be invertible.
   - This matrix satisfies the differential equation \(\Phi'(t) = A\Phi(t)\).

5. **Variation of Parameters**: Using \(\Phi(t)\), one sets up an equation to find a particular solution of the non-homogeneous system by considering \(\Phi(t)c\) where \(c\) is not constant but a function of \(t\). This leads to solving for \(c\) using:
   - The relationship \(\Phi'(t)c + \Phi(t)c' = g(t)\), where \(g(t)\) represents the non-homogeneous part.

This method leverages the fundamental matrix and its properties to systematically derive a particular solution, integrating these into the broader framework of solving differential equations.
