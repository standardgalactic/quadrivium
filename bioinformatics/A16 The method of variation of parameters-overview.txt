The text discusses solving systems of non-homogeneous linear differential equations using the method of variation of parameters. This approach is preferred over undetermined coefficients when the latter doesn't work effectively.

1. **Preliminary Work**: Before finding a particular solution, one must first determine the complementary solution by setting \( f(t) = 0 \), solving \( x' = Ax \). 

2. **Fundamental Matrix**: The fundamental matrix is crucial in this method. It involves forming an n-by-n matrix (\(\Phi(t)\)) using solutions of the homogeneous system (eigenvectors scaled by exponentials involving eigenvalues).

3. **Structure**:
   - Solutions are expressed as \( x = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \ldots + c_nx_n \), where each \( x_i \) is a solution of the homogeneous system.
   - These solutions can be organized into a matrix form, \(\Phi(t)\), with columns representing individual solutions.

4. **Properties**:
   - The determinant (Wronskian) of \(\Phi(t)\) must be non-zero for it to be invertible.
   - This matrix satisfies the differential equation \(\Phi'(t) = A\Phi(t)\).

5. **Variation of Parameters**: Using \(\Phi(t)\), one sets up an equation to find a particular solution of the non-homogeneous system by considering \(\Phi(t)c\) where \(c\) is not constant but a function of \(t\). This leads to solving for \(c\) using:
   - The relationship \(\Phi'(t)c + \Phi(t)c' = g(t)\), where \(g(t)\) represents the non-homogeneous part.

This method leverages the fundamental matrix and its properties to systematically derive a particular solution, integrating these into the broader framework of solving differential equations.

The text discusses solving systems of non-homogeneous differential equations using the method of variation of parameters. Unlike undetermined coefficients, which might not always work, this approach is more robust. The process begins with understanding and obtaining the complementary solution by setting the non-homogeneous term \( f(t) \) to zero and solving \( x' = Ax \).

The key element in this method is constructing a fundamental matrix. This involves creating a set of solutions for the homogeneous system, represented as column vectors. These vectors are combined into an \( n \times n \) fundamental matrix (\( \Phi(t) \)), where each column is derived from individual solutions. The text emphasizes that the determinant (Wronskian) of this matrix must be non-zero to ensure it has an inverse.

The next step involves using the relationship between the derivative of the fundamental matrix and the original system matrix \( A \). Specifically, the equation \( \Phi'(t) = A\Phi(t) \) is crucial. This forms the basis for setting up the variation of parameters technique, where one seeks a particular solution to the non-homogeneous problem by incorporating the inverse of the fundamental matrix into the equation.

Overall, the text outlines the preliminary steps necessary to apply variation of parameters effectively, highlighting the construction and properties of the fundamental matrix as pivotal to finding solutions.
