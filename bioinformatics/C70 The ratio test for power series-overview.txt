The text provides a step-by-step explanation of finding the interval of convergence for a power series using the Ratio Test. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: Determine the interval where a given power series converges.

2. **Method**: Apply the Ratio Test, which involves calculating the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity of the absolute value of successive terms in the series.

3. **Process**:
   - Express the ratio of consecutive terms.
   - Simplify using algebraic rules and properties of exponents.
   - Identify that certain terms are independent of \( n \) and can be factored out.
   - Resolve any indeterminate forms using L'Hôpital's Rule by differentiating the numerator and denominator separately.

4. **Result**: 
   - The series converges where the derived expression is less than 1.
   - This leads to the inequality \( |x - 3| < 2 \), which simplifies to the interval \( 1 < x < 5 \).

5. **Endpoint Testing**:
   - Check convergence at the endpoints \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \) separately, as the Ratio Test does not determine convergence at these points.

6. **Conclusion**: The series converges within the interval \( (1, 5) \), with further testing required to confirm behavior at the boundaries.

The text provides a step-by-step explanation of finding the interval of convergence for a given power series using the Ratio Test. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: Determine the interval where the series converges.

2. **Method**: Apply the Ratio Test, which involves taking the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity of the absolute value of successive terms.

3. **Expression Setup**:
   - Consider terms in the form \( (x-3)^{n+1} / 2^{n+1}(n+1) \).
   - Divide by the previous term, leading to simplification using power rules.

4. **Limit Calculation**:
   - Simplify the expression to focus on terms involving \( n \), resulting in an indeterminate form (\(\infty/\infty\)).
   - Apply L'Hôpital's Rule to resolve this, taking derivatives of the numerator and denominator separately.

5. **Result**: The series converges absolutely where the limit is less than 1, leading to the inequality \( |(x-3)/2| < 1 \).

6. **Interval Determination**:
   - Solve the inequality: \( -1 < (x-3)/2 < 1 \).
   - Simplify to find \( 1 < x < 5 \).

7. **Endpoint Testing**: Check convergence at endpoints \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \) separately.

8. **Conclusion**: The interval of convergence is \( 1 < x < 5 \), with endpoint behavior requiring additional verification.
