The text provides a step-by-step explanation of finding the interval of convergence for a power series using the Ratio Test. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: Determine the interval where a given power series converges.

2. **Method**: Apply the Ratio Test, which involves calculating the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity of the absolute value of successive terms in the series.

3. **Process**:
   - Express the ratio of consecutive terms.
   - Simplify using algebraic rules and properties of exponents.
   - Identify that certain terms are independent of \( n \) and can be factored out.
   - Resolve any indeterminate forms using L'HÃ´pital's Rule by differentiating the numerator and denominator separately.

4. **Result**: 
   - The series converges where the derived expression is less than 1.
   - This leads to the inequality \( |x - 3| < 2 \), which simplifies to the interval \( 1 < x < 5 \).

5. **Endpoint Testing**:
   - Check convergence at the endpoints \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 5 \) separately, as the Ratio Test does not determine convergence at these points.

6. **Conclusion**: The series converges within the interval \( (1, 5) \), with further testing required to confirm behavior at the boundaries.
