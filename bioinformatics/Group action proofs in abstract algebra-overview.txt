You've outlined an interesting concept regarding group actions and their relationship to permutations. Let's break down the key ideas:

### Group Actions

1. **Definition**: A group \( G \) acts on a set \( X \) if there is a function from \( G \times X \to X \), denoted by \( (g, x) \mapsto g \cdot x \), satisfying:
   - Identity: For the identity element \( e \in G \), \( e \cdot x = x \) for all \( x \in X \).
   - Compatibility: For all \( g, h \in G \) and \( x \in X \), \( (gh) \cdot x = g \cdot (h \cdot x) \).

2. **Action as Permutations**: Each element \( g \in G \) induces a permutation on the set \( X \). This means that for each \( g \), there is a bijective function from \( X \) to itself, which we denote by \( \sigma_g: X \to X \).

### Permutations and Bijections

1. **Permutation**: A permutation of a set \( X \) is a bijection (one-to-one and onto mapping) from \( X \) to itself.

2. **Bijection Properties**:
   - **Injective (One-to-One)**: Different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain.
   - **Surjective (Onto)**: Every element in the codomain is mapped by some element in the domain.

### Proof Sketch for Bijection

The argument you provided focuses on showing that each group action corresponds to a bijection:

1. **Two-Sided Inverse**: If \( \sigma_g \) has an inverse, it must be bijective:
   - **Injective**: Assume not injective leads to contradiction because some elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain, violating the group action properties.
   - **Surjective**: Assume not surjective leads to contradiction because there would be elements in the codomain that are not mapped by any element in the domain.

2. **Conclusion**: Since each \( \sigma_g \) is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection. Therefore, each group action corresponds to a permutation of the set \( X \).

### Intuition

- The essence of group actions is that they "scramble" or permute elements of the set \( X \).
- Each element of the group acts like a rearrangement mechanism for \( X \), ensuring every possible configuration (permutation) is achievable.

This understanding ties together the concepts of group theory and permutations, showing how abstract algebraic structures can have concrete applications in organizing and transforming sets.
