The text outlines the method for calculating the cross product of two vectors, \( \mathbf{A} = (3, -2, 0) \) and \( \mathbf{B} = (1, 2, 0) \), in three-dimensional space using their components. The steps are as follows:

1. **Direction**: Use the right-hand rule to determine that the resultant vector (\( \mathbf{C} \)) will point out of the plane, specifically in the positive z-direction.

2. **Matrix Setup**:
   - Construct a 3x3 matrix with unit vectors \( \mathbf{i}, -\mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} \) as the first row.
   - The second and third rows contain the components of vectors \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \), respectively:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \mathbf{i} & -\mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
     3 & -2 & 0 \\
     1 & 2 & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Determinant Calculation**:
   - Compute the determinant along the first row to find each component of \( \mathbf{C} \).
   - The \( \mathbf{i} \) component is calculated as: 
     \[
     (-2)(0) - (0)(2) = 0
     \]
   - The \( \mathbf{j} \) component is:
     \[
     (3)(0) - (0)(1) = 0
     \]
   - The \( \mathbf{k} \) component is:
     \[
     (3)(2) - (-2)(1) = 6 + 2 = 8
     \]

4. **Result**: The cross product \( \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = (0, 0, 8) \).

The resultant vector \( \mathbf{C} \) is \( 8\mathbf{k} \), indicating it points out of the plane with a magnitude of 8. This method can be applied to any vectors in three-dimensional space by setting up a similar matrix and calculating the determinant along the first row.
