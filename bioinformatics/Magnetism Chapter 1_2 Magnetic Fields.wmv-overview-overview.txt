The text provides methods for calculating the forces acting on electrons and protons as they move through uniform magnetic fields using vector cross products. Hereâ€™s a summary:

1. **Electron Force Calculation**:
   - The velocity of an electron is given by \( \vec{v} = (2.0 \times 10^6) \hat{i} + (3.0 \times 10^6) \hat{j} \, \text{m/s} \).
   - It traverses a magnetic field \( \vec{B} = 0.03 \hat{i} - 0.15 \hat{j} \, \text{T} \).
   - The force is calculated using \( \vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \), adjusting for the electron's negative charge by multiplying its velocity vector by \(-1\).

2. **Proton Force Calculation**:
   - A proton moves with components \( V_x \) and \( V_y \) through a specified magnetic field.
   - The force is determined using \( \vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \), where \( q \) is the proton's charge.
   - Solving for \( V_x \) and \( V_y \) involves equations from known x and y directional forces.

3. **Cross-Field Effect**:
   - The concept of a charged particle moving through both electric and magnetic fields (cross-field effect) is introduced, connected to the electron's discovery.
   - It explains how an electric field between plates can exert additional force on a charged particle alongside any magnetic force.

The text discusses using vector cross products to determine forces and algebraic manipulation for solving unknown velocity components. It highlights ensuring no z-component force when it should be absent.

A key principle described is configuring electric and magnetic fields to cancel each other's effects, allowing a charged particle to move in a straight line without deflection. This is achieved by balancing the electric field force (\( QE \)) with the magnetic field force (\( QVB\sin(\phi) \)), leading to \( V = \frac{E}{B} \).

The text further explains how this setup can lead to calculating the charge-to-mass ratio of a particle, similar to Rutherford's discovery. The formula used is:

\[ \left( \frac{m}{q} \right) = \frac{B^2L^2}{2YE} \]

where \( B \), \( L \), \( Y \), and \( E \) are measurements of magnetic field strength, plate length, deflection, and electric field, respectively.

The main takeaway is the ability to configure fields such that they negate each other's forces on a charged particle, facilitating applications in various physics problems.
