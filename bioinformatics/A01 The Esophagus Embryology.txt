In this chapter we're going to discuss the esophagus.
We'll have a look at the embryology, the anatomy, the physiology, the clinical picture and the problem list.
Now here's the embryology, you can see on the right hand side there it only has a bar up to level 1
so this is not critical information for you to remember for exam situations.
Nonetheless we have a three layered embryo which undergoes cephalocardinal and lateral folding
and down the middle that forms a tubal structure which is the primitive gut tube.
Now the foregut is the first part of that and that goes from the pharyngeal tube to the liver outgrowth.
Quite short as it starts but as the mediastinal structures start to develop the heart and lungs
there's rapid elongation of this tube which forms the esophagus.
Now with the three layers of the embryo, the endoderm, the mesoderm and the ectoderm
from the endoderm we're going to get the epithelial lining.
As it moves down it turns into a squamous type cell as far as the area near the stomach is concerned.
But then the mesodermal layer is going to form muscle and the serosal layers.
Now the upper two thirds, upper half is going to differentiate into striated muscles with a vagal nerve supply
and then the bottom third is going to differentiate into smooth muscle with a splanchnic nerve supply.
In the next video we're going to start looking at some anatomy.
