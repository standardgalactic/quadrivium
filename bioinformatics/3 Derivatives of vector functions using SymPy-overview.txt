To display an image using Python, you can use libraries such as `matplotlib` or `PIL` (Pillow). Below is a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this with both methods:

### Method 1: Using Matplotlib

First, make sure you have the required library installed. If not, install it using pip:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

Here's how you can display an image using `matplotlib`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

# Load the image file
image = mpimg.imread('your_image_file.png')  # Replace 'your_image_file.png' with your actual image path

# Display the image
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis('off')  # Hide axis labels and ticks
plt.show()
```

### Method 2: Using PIL (Pillow)

First, install Pillow if it's not already installed:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

Here’s how you can display an image using `PIL`:

```python
from PIL import Image

# Open the image file
image = Image.open('your_image_file.png')  # Replace 'your_image_file.png' with your actual image path

# Display the image
image.show()
```

### Explanation of Your Physics Problem (Velocity and Position Vectors)

From your description, it seems you are working on a physics problem involving parametric equations for position and velocity vectors.

1. **Position Vector**: You have described a parametric equation for motion in two dimensions:
   \[
   \mathbf{r}(t) = (-\cos(2t), \sin(2t))
   \]
   This represents a circle with radius 1, traced twice as \( t \) goes from 0 to \( \pi \).

2. **Velocity Vector**: The velocity vector is the derivative of the position vector with respect to time:
   \[
   \mathbf{v}(t) = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = (2\sin(2t), 2\cos(2t))
   \]

3. **Orthogonality**: For a circle, the position vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) and velocity vector \( \mathbf{v}(t) \) are always orthogonal. This means their dot product is zero:
   \[
   \mathbf{r}(t) \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) = (-\cos(2t))(2\sin(2t)) + (\sin(2t))(2\cos(2t)) = 0
   \]

This orthogonality is a characteristic property of circular motion, where the velocity vector is always tangent to the path, perpendicular to the radius (position vector).

The text describes using a library (possibly SymPy) to perform operations on vectors, specifically focusing on calculating dot products, orthogonality, and derivatives related to position and velocity vectors. Here's a summary:

1. **Dot Product**: The text explains how to compute the dot product of two vectors by multiplying their corresponding components (x with x and y with y) and summing these products. It demonstrates that if the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal.

2. **Orthogonality and Geometry**: If a position vector and a velocity vector are orthogonal (dot product equals zero), it implies that the magnitude of the position vector remains constant, describing motion along a circle in two dimensions or a sphere in three dimensions. This constancy occurs only when these vectors are perpendicular.

3. **Vector Representation and Calculation**:
   - Two vectors `p1` and `p2` are defined with components (`x₁`, `y₁`) and (`x₂`, `y₂`), respectively.
   - The dot product is calculated as \( x_1 \times x_2 + y_1 \times y_2 \).
   - An example of orthogonality is given, showing how the lack of change in one direction (e.g., vertical motion with no horizontal component) results in a zero dot product.

4. **Norm and Angle**: The text introduces another way to understand the dot product: as the product of the magnitudes (norms) of two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.

5. **Differentiation for Acceleration**:
   - The acceleration vector is derived by differentiating the position vector with respect to time, resulting in a new expression involving trigonometric functions (`4cos(2t)` and `-4sin(2t)`).
   - This demonstrates how to perform differentiation on vector-valued functions using SymPy.

Overall, the text illustrates basic vector operations and their geometric interpretations using symbolic computation tools.
