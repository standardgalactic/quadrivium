The text discusses the concept of commutativity within groups, emphasizing that while not a defining characteristic of all groups, some elements in specific groups may commute. It explores several scenarios where if two elements \(A\) and \(B\) in a group \(G\) satisfy \(AB = BA\), their inverses also commute: \(A^{-1}B^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}\).

The text provides proofs for various cases:
1. **Inverses of Commuting Elements**: Given \(AB = BA\), the inverses \(A^{-1}\) and \(B^{-1}\) also satisfy \(A^{-1}B^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}\).
2. **Commutativity of Powers**: If \(AB = BA\), then:
   - \(AA\) (or \(A^2\)) commutes with \(B\): \(A^2B = BA^2\).
   - \(A^2\) and \(B^2\) commute: \(A^2B^2 = B^2A^2\).
3. **Involving Additional Elements**: For an element \(x\) in the group, if \(AB = BA\), then \(ABx^{-1}\) commutes with itself when rearranged using associativity and the identity property: \(ABx^{-1} = xBx^{-1}Ax^{-1}\).

The text encourages creativity and exploration to understand these properties within groups that exhibit commutativity for certain elements.
