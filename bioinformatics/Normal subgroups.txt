Before we go into cosets and where we're really going with cosets,
it remains this little mystery about why we're spending so much time on cosets.
Remember this little picture from yesterday?
We have that A is not an element of H,
but I might as well have drawn A being an element of H.
I have my left coset, I have my right coset.
And the question is, when are these two cosets,
here's my left coset, when are they equal to each other, my right coset?
And of course, if I define this as A in binary operation with H,
there's my binary operation,
and this I define as H in binary operation with A,
such that H is an element of H,
you can well imagine that if the group is abelian,
then I have commutivity, of course,
and then they are equal to each other.
Now, there's another specific circumstance in which these two cosets are equal.
Left and right and cosets of an element A of the group G
is equal to each other, the left and right cosets.
If the subgroup is what is called a normal subgroup.
So, I just want to spend this little video on normal subgroups.
What is a normal subgroup?
And if H was a subgroup of G,
it's usually written in textbooks as this closed triangle,
smaller than, less than sign,
and this line closing it.
It's a normal subgroup.
And we define there's a definition of when something is a normal subgroup.
And we say that H is stable under conjugation by the elements of G,
so that if we have H as an element of H,
and G as an element of G,
we have the fact that,
we have this fact that H is stable,
so G binary operation with H binary operation with G inverse
is still going to be an element of H.
It is stable under conjugation
by all the elements inside of,
oops, oops, oops, of G.
So, H is an element of H,
G is an element of G,
and we have this conjugation.
We say H is stable under conjugation by elements in G
because G binary operation,
H binary operation, G inverse,
those have to be the inverses of each other,
remains an element of H.
That is our definition of a normal subgroup.
So, we are saying,
assuming that we have a normal subgroup,
so assuming a normal subgroup,
can I show that,
or I say that this implies that
the left coset is equal to the right coset?
How do I do this proof?
Very simple.
I have two sets there.
If I want to prove two sets are equal to each other,
I've got to prove two parts.
First of all,
I've got to prove that
A, H is a subgroup of,
the left is a subgroup of the right.
Now, let's just choose
an A,
A, H that is an element of the left coset
because that is the definition
of a left coset.
Now, I need to find,
find, let's make it H star,
which is such that,
I want to find that there exists this H star,
such that A,
let's make it such that,
we have that this
is equal to A, H.
I need to find that,
and if I find that,
that means that this
is a subgroup inside of that
because this will belong
to the right coset.
and I'm going to let
this
equal
A, H,
A inverse.
Why can I do that?
Because this one,
remember,
this here
is an element of,
this is an element of H
and
we assumed
that this is a normal subgroup,
this A belongs to G
and I said that
under this special circumstance
of a normal subgroup,
it remains an element of that.
It remains an element of that.
And if I were to rewrite this now,
with this being there,
I have
A,
H,
A inverse,
A,
and that is just a
binary operation with H,
which is that,
I've shown that this
is a subgroup of that.
So that's showing the one way,
the other way,
I have to show that
the right coset
is a subset of
the left coset.
Again,
so what I need to show now
is that I have this,
remember,
this is an element of H, A,
that is by definition.
and I need now to find this
so that I have,
so I need to find
this H star
such that
that I have
the fact that
it's the other way around now.
If we just look at it,
I need it to show that
this was equal to that.
I now need to show
that something is equal
to this one.
that I have this
H,
A is equal to
being then
a subgroup of that.
And I just need to,
there's just a little caveat
in this one.
I need to show,
I need to use
what is called conjugation.
So I'm going to let this
equal,
and I'm going to let this
equal this,
A.
Now you might say that,
you know,
that's not right
because I had the inverse
at the end there
and now have the inverse
in the front.
But just think of it
like this.
We know that
A inverse
is inverse
equals A.
So what I really have here,
what I really have here
is something
and it's
sort of,
and it's inverse.
So what I have here,
see this sum,
is let A inverse
equal,
just some element G.
So what I really have there
is G,
H,
and it's inverse
because the inverse
of this
is just itself.
So just see this as G
and it's inverse.
So that's called conjugation
and there's no problem
writing it the other way around.
And if I have that
and I plug that in here,
if I plug that in there,
I'm going to get
exactly what we started off with.
So I've shown that
this is a subset of that.
I've shown that
this is a subset of that.
So under the assumption
that I have a normal subgroup
and we know what a normal subgroup is
by definition,
we've defined it.
We have the fact
that the left coset
and the right coset
are equal to each other.
so we have two circumstances.
One is
if we have an abelian group,
then I can just use commutivity.
That's just trivial.
But I know that
if I use this definition
of this very special kind of subgroup
called a normal subgroup,
then it's very easy to show
that these two subsets
are actually,
these two cosets,
left and right hand cosets
are actually equal to each other.
So a little detour
just to define this
normal subgroup
and under what circumstances
we have cosets
being equal to each other.
Thank you.
