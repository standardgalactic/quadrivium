Let's do a problem with the general differential equation for waves
and we remember that that is di squared y over di x squared
equals y over v squared
and di squared y over di t squared
There we go
We are given a wave equation of a wave in terms of x and t
and usually in a problem probably they'll say this is 3 millimeters
but then you have SI units there and there
so just change this 3 millimeters into 0.003
and there seems to be 3 significant digits meters
So if you're going to do a calculus on these problems
remember to use radians, it's not important here
and then change these all to SI units
and they want us to calculate the velocity of this wave
using the general differential equation of waves
Now when I showed you how to derive this equation
we made a few jumps
we said well dx is almost as long as L
and the y component of f1 and f2 were negligibly small
so we need to see is this really true?
Well there's another way to get velocity I think from this
and those are the two equations right in the beginning I said
that you have to memorize and please never ever forget
and that is that the frequency equals
let's put it this way
remember that omega equals 2 pi times the frequency
in other words the frequency equals omega divided by 2 pi
and we also remember that k equals 2 pi over lambda
the angular wave number
in other words lambda equals 2 pi over k
and we know that velocity equals frequency times wavelength
so for frequency we have omega divided by 2 pi
times for lambda we have 2 pi over k
cancel cancel so this equals omega divided by k
and if we look here we do have omega which is 7.00 inverse seconds
and we have k which is 4.000 inverse meters
and 7 divided by 4 or what is that 1.75
for 3 significant digits
I bring inverse meters up into the denominator
which makes it meters meters per second
so we know our answer should be 1.75 meters in the seconds
okay
so that's where we have to get to
let's see though if we can use the general differential equation
for waves to get the velocity
very quickly I'm going to bring velocity over to the other side
so that is going to equal di squared y over di t squared divided by di squared y over di x squared
and if I just take v that's going to equal the square root of that
that is certainly what we're aiming for and just to solve v
let's do that and that's why we do this as partial derivatives
because here we're going to have x a constant
and here we're going to have time as a constant
so let's do that
what I want to do and what I do suggest
if you're going to differentiate these twice
because this is the second derivative of y
the second derivative of y
just make life slightly easier for yourself
just write y
just a little trick equals
I'm going to write 0.00300 meters
the side of
and I'm just going to call this phase
let's call that phase p
I don't want to rewrite all of that all the time
so I'm going to let this phase equal p
I've just chosen p
I'm going to choose anything you want
let's take the first derivative
partial derivative
with respect to
the partial derivative
with respect to
of y
with respect to
and the numerator there we have
with respect to time
in other words
x is a constant
x is a constant
so if I differentiate this
what am I going to get?
I'm going to get
it's going to equal
0.00300 meters
the first derivative of a sine is the cosine
of the cosine of p
remember but then
through
implicit differentiation
I've also now got to
take the first derivative of
this p as well
of the inside function
which for me
remember x is a constant
so this will fall away
so here I have negative
7.00 inverse seconds
and
if I just multiply that out
that is going to equal
minus
I'm multiplying this by this
I'm just making it easier
minus
0.7 times 3 is
21
0
2
1
0
meters
per second
meters per second
cosine
of p
I hope I didn't make
I hope I didn't
on my cheat board there
I don't think I made any mistakes
let's hope not
now let's take the second derivative
partial derivative
with respect to time
so again
it's going to be
of
of this
to have that correct
yes
so I'm going to have
again
negative 0.021
meters per second
the first derivative of cosine
is negative
with sine
negative with sine of p
but remember I still have to
then differentiate p
which is there
x is a constant
so again I'm going to be
left with negative
7.00 inverse seconds
and if I multiply
all of these
if I multiply negative
times negative
times negative
I'm going to be left with a negative
get more chalk
I'm going to be left with a negative
and I've got to multiply
this by 7
I've done it there
I think I get
negative 0.147
I get meters
per second
do I
now I get meters per second squared
meters per second squared
times the sine of p
okay
now let's do it
with respect to
by y
with respect to x
in other words
t is now
my constant
so I've just got to differentiate this side
so again I'm going to be left with
0.00300
meters
first delivered
is cosine of p
and I've still got to differentiate that
t is now constant
so this is just
4.00 inverse meters
and if I multiply 4 times that
I'm going to get
0.0
it's 12
0.0120
and now I've got
meters
and inverse meters
so they cancel out
that's nothing
and I have the cosine of p
cosine of p
let's take the second derivative
what I'm going to do
let me just stop this video
I don't want this to
stop recording again
I'll put the two together
okay
there we go
so if I take the second derivative
partial derivative
with respect to x
here
of this
I'm going to get my
0.0120
without units
the first derivative of the cosine
is negative the sine of p
and I've still got to differentiate
this partial derivative of t as a constant
so again
I'm left with
4.00 inverse meters
if I just multiply
this whole account
I'm going to be left with
negative the sine
negative
0.12 times 4
is 48
that is 0.0480
low units
inverse meter
and then
times the sine of p
sine of p
okay
I'm not going to go
I'm not going to explain
how to do
first and second derivatives
I think by
I know
everyone watching this video
should be able to do that
okay
let's just make some space
let's make some space
I don't need this one
do I
do I
do I
where do I have
okay
the ones I'm interested in
is this
and I'm interested in this
okay
okay
so v
this is going to be
the square root of
partial root y with respect to t second
which is this one
so that will be
negative
0.147 meters per second squared
sine of p
divided by
this one
0.0480
and I have inverse meters
sine of p
my sines cancel
and if I
if I didn't use p
and I had written this whole thing
I still
I'm still going to
left with this as my phase
and it is going to cancel
if I bring this meter up
that's going to be
meter squared per second squared
if I take the square root of that
so
very pleasing again to be
left with meters per second
and this
divided by this
lo and behold
is 7 over 4 meters per second
which is
1.75 meters per second
okay
so
it works
and
in
it
was
not
its
yours
hold
out
is
