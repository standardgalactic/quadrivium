The text describes solving a higher-order differential equation using Euler's method. The goal is to convert a second-order differential equation into two first-order equations. Specifically, the original equation \( y'' = f(x, y, y') \) is transformed by setting \( y' = u \), making \( u' = y'' \). This allows rewriting the equation in terms of \( x \), \( y \), and \( u \).

The example given involves solving the differential equation \( y'' = 4y' - 4y \) with initial conditions at \( x = 0 \): \( y(0) = 1 \) and \( y'(0) = 2 \). The solution is approached numerically using Euler's method with a step size of 0.01.

The procedure involves:
- Defining the equations: \( u' = 4u - 4y \).
- Initializing values: \( x_0 = 0 \), \( y_0 = 1 \), \( u_0 = 2 \).
- Iterating over a loop while \( x < 1 \) to compute new values of \( y \) and \( u \) using the equations.
- Printing the results in a tabulated format for clarity.

The script uses Python, with special attention given to ensuring numerical calculations are treated as floating-point operations. The output neatly displays corresponding \( x \) and \( y \) values through each iteration step, demonstrating Euler's method applied to this specific differential equation.
