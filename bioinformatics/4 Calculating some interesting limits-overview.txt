The text provides an explanation of how to calculate limits in calculus, particularly when direct application of limit laws isn't possible due to indeterminate forms. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Limit Laws and Indeterminate Forms**: The limit laws can be applied only if the limit exists. When faced with a 0/0 form (an indeterminate form), these laws cannot directly be used.

2. **Factorization**: In cases where direct substitution results in an indeterminate form like 0/0, factorizing the numerator or denominator is a useful technique. For example, when calculating \(\lim_{t \to 2} \frac{t^2 - 4}{2 - t}\), factoring \(t^2 - 4\) into \((t-2)(t+2)\) and recognizing that \(2-t = -(t-2)\) allows cancellation, leading to a valid limit calculation.

3. **Using Powers**: Another method involves using limit laws with powers or roots. For instance, if you have a cube root function like \(\lim_{t \to 2} (\text{f(t)})^{1/3}\), you can take the limit of the inner function first and then apply the cube root.

4. **Rationalizing**: In more complex expressions involving square roots, rationalization is helpful. Multiplying by a conjugate can simplify expressions, such as \(\frac{\sqrt{t+2} - \sqrt{2}}{t}\), allowing for direct substitution after simplification.

5. **Direct Substitution**: If substituting the limit value directly into the function does not result in an indeterminate form (e.g., 0/0 or ∞/∞), then the result of this substitution is the limit.

6. **Strategies Summary**:
   - Try direct substitution first.
   - Use factorization to simplify expressions with indeterminate forms.
   - Apply powers or roots appropriately when dealing with functions involving these operations.
   - Rationalize numerators (or denominators) in complex expressions involving square roots.

The text illustrates these strategies through examples, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and addressing indeterminate forms to successfully calculate limits.
