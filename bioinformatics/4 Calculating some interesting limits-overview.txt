The text provides an explanation of how to calculate limits in calculus, particularly when direct application of limit laws isn't possible due to indeterminate forms. Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Limit Laws and Indeterminate Forms**: The limit laws can be applied only if the limit exists. When faced with a 0/0 form (an indeterminate form), these laws cannot directly be used.

2. **Factorization**: In cases where direct substitution results in an indeterminate form like 0/0, factorizing the numerator or denominator is a useful technique. For example, when calculating \(\lim_{t \to 2} \frac{t^2 - 4}{2 - t}\), factoring \(t^2 - 4\) into \((t-2)(t+2)\) and recognizing that \(2-t = -(t-2)\) allows cancellation, leading to a valid limit calculation.

3. **Using Powers**: Another method involves using limit laws with powers or roots. For instance, if you have a cube root function like \(\lim_{t \to 2} (\text{f(t)})^{1/3}\), you can take the limit of the inner function first and then apply the cube root.

4. **Rationalizing**: In more complex expressions involving square roots, rationalization is helpful. Multiplying by a conjugate can simplify expressions, such as \(\frac{\sqrt{t+2} - \sqrt{2}}{t}\), allowing for direct substitution after simplification.

5. **Direct Substitution**: If substituting the limit value directly into the function does not result in an indeterminate form (e.g., 0/0 or ∞/∞), then the result of this substitution is the limit.

6. **Strategies Summary**:
   - Try direct substitution first.
   - Use factorization to simplify expressions with indeterminate forms.
   - Apply powers or roots appropriately when dealing with functions involving these operations.
   - Rationalize numerators (or denominators) in complex expressions involving square roots.

The text illustrates these strategies through examples, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and addressing indeterminate forms to successfully calculate limits.

The text provides strategies for calculating limits, emphasizing understanding when limit laws can be applied and highlighting techniques to handle indeterminate forms. Here's a summary of the main points:

1. **Limit Laws**: These are applicable only if the limit exists. Direct application without checking may lead to incorrect conclusions.

2. **Indeterminate Forms (0/0)**: When direct substitution results in an indeterminate form like 0/0, further techniques must be used:
   - **Factorization**: Simplify expressions by factoring and canceling common terms.
     - Example: \(\lim_{t \to 2} \frac{t^2-4}{2-t}\) is initially indeterminate. By factorizing the numerator as \((t-2)(t+2)\) and recognizing that \(2-t = -(t-2)\), we simplify to \(-\lim_{t \to 2}(t+2)\), yielding -4.
   - **Rationalization**: Multiply by a conjugate to eliminate roots in the numerator or denominator.
     - Example: For limits involving square roots, multiply by a suitable expression that rationalizes the numerator.

3. **Direct Substitution**: Attempt this first. If it results in a simple value (not an indeterminate form), it is the solution.

4. **Power Rule for Limits**: In some cases, extract powers outside the limit when applicable.
   - Example: \(\lim_{t \to 2} \sqrt{t+2}\) can be evaluated by direct substitution since it does not lead to an indeterminate form.

5. **Factoring and Simplifying Complex Expressions**:
   - Factor expressions to cancel out terms that cause indeterminacy.
     - Example: For \(\lim_{t \to 4} \frac{t^2-2t-8}{t^2-3t-4}\), factor both the numerator and denominator, then simplify by canceling common factors.

6. **Example of Direct Solution**: 
   - For \(\lim_{t \to 2} (t^3-t-6)\), direct substitution gives a straightforward result since it does not lead to an indeterminate form.

The text underscores that recognizing when and how to apply these techniques is crucial for solving limits effectively.
