The text explains how to find the derivatives of the trigonometric functions tangent (\(\tan(x)\)) and secant (\(\sec(x)\)) using calculus techniques:

1. **Derivative of Tangent**:
   - The function \(\tan(x)\) is expressed as \(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\).
   - Applying the quotient rule, where \(u = \sin(x)\) and \(v = \cos(x)\), the derivative becomes:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \frac{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \sec^2(x)
     \]
   - Thus, \(\frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x)\), which can also be written as \(1 + \tan^2(x)\).

2. **Derivative of Secant**:
   - The function \(\sec(x)\) is rewritten as \(\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\).
   - Using the quotient rule, where \(u = 1\) and \(v = \cos(x)\), the derivative becomes:
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \sec(x) \tan(x)
     \]
   - Therefore, \(\frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \sec(x) \tan(x)\).

These derivatives are crucial for solving trigonometric integration and related calculus problems. The text also briefly mentions the identity of secant as \(1/\cos(x)\) and hints at further exploration into integrals involving these functions, although some numerical mention ("97 of x") is noted without clear context.
