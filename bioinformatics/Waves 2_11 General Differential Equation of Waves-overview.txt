The text describes solving a wave equation using the general differential equation for waves, which states:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{y}{v^2}
\]
and 
\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}
\]

The given problem involves a wave expressed in terms of \(x\) and \(t\), with an initial amplitude of 3 millimeters, which is converted to 0.003 meters (in SI units). The task is to calculate the velocity (\(v\)) of this wave.

To find the wave velocity using the general differential equation for waves:

1. **Relate frequency and wavelength**: 
   - Frequency (\(f\)) can be expressed as \(\omega / 2\pi\), where \(\omega\) (angular frequency) is given as \(7.00 \, \text{s}^{-1}\).
   - Wavelength (\(\lambda\)) is related to the wave number (\(k\)), such that \(\lambda = 2\pi/k\), with \(k = 4.000 \, \text{m}^{-1}\).

2. **Calculate velocity using frequency and wavelength**: 
   - The wave velocity \(v\) is given by \(f \times \lambda\).
   - Substituting the expressions for \(f\) and \(\lambda\), we get:
     \[
     v = \left(\frac{\omega}{2\pi}\right) \times \left(\frac{2\pi}{k}\right) = \frac{\omega}{k}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values, \(v = 7.00 / 4.000 = 1.75 \, \text{m/s}\).

3. **Alternative approach using the differential equation**:
   - Rearrange the wave equation to solve for velocity: 
     \[
     v^2 = \frac{\partial^2 y / \partial t^2}{\partial^2 y / \partial x^2}
     \]
   - Thus, \(v = \sqrt{\frac{\partial^2 y / \partial t^2}{\partial^2 y / \partial x^2}}\).

4. **Differentiation**:
   - Let \(y = 0.00300 \sin(p)\), where \(p\) is the phase.
   - Differentiate with respect to time and space, keeping in mind that one variable is constant during each differentiation.

The solution confirms that using both methods (analytical expressions for frequency/wavelength and differential equations) yields a wave velocity of 1.75 m/s.

The text describes a mathematical process involving differentiation and multiplication:

1. **First Derivative with Respect to Time (t):**
   - The expression involves multiplying \(-0.021\) meters per second by the derivative of \(\cos(p)\), resulting in \(-\sin(p)\).
   - Since \(p\) is dependent on time, its derivative is \(-7.00\) inverse seconds.
   - Multiplying these gives a result of \(-0.147\) meters per second squared times \(\sin(p)\).

2. **First Derivative with Respect to Position (x):**
   - Differentiating with respect to \(x\), where time \(t\) is constant, results in \(0.00300\) meters times the derivative of \(\cos(p)\).
   - The derivative here involves \(4.00\) inverse meters.
   - Multiplying these gives \(0.0120\) (meters cancel out with inverse meters) times \(\cos(p)\).

3. **Second Derivative with Respect to Position (x):**
   - The process continues by taking the second derivative, but the text stops here.

The calculations involve trigonometric functions and their derivatives, considering constants for differentiation purposes.

The text describes a mathematical process involving derivatives, specifically focusing on partial derivatives and their application to trigonometric functions.

Here's a summary of the steps outlined:

1. **Second Derivative Calculation**:
   - The second derivative with respect to \( x \) is taken.
   - This involves differentiating the cosine function, which results in \(-\sin(p)\).
   - A constant partial derivative with respect to \( t \) gives \( 4.00 \, \text{m}^{-1} \).

2. **Multiplication**:
   - The result of the second derivative is multiplied by \(-0.12\) and \(4.00\), yielding \(-0.0480 \, \text{m}^{-1}\).
   - This is then multiplied by \(\sin(p)\).

3. **Expression for Velocity (\( v \))**:
   - The velocity is calculated as the square root of a derived expression involving these derivatives.
   - Specifically, it involves dividing \(-0.147 \, \text{m/s}^2\) times \(\sin(p)\) by \(0.0480\).
   - Units and trigonometric terms cancel out appropriately.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The final velocity is calculated to be \(1.75 \, \text{m/s}\).

The text emphasizes the cancellation of units and trigonometric functions, leading to a simplified result for velocity.
