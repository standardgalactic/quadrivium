Hypovolemic shock is caused by significant fluid loss, often from hemorrhage (blood loss) or plasma depletion due to fluid sequestration in tissues or losses through the gastrointestinal or urinary systems. This type of shock can be challenging to identify and may follow conditions like infection, inflammation, pancreatitis, trauma, or surgery, which increase capillary permeability.

To compensate for reduced blood volume (hypovolemia), the body activates sympathetic responses, releases stress hormones, resorbs interstitial fluid, mobilizes intracellular fluid, and enhances renal conservation to maintain essential blood flow to the brain and heart.

Hemorrhage-related shock is classified based on the percentage of total blood volume lost:
- **Class 1**: 10-15% loss (500-750 mL), typically well-tolerated with mild tachycardia.
- **Class 2**: 15-30% loss (750 mL to 1.5 L), leading to anxiety, pronounced tachycardia, reduced pulse pressure, cold extremities, and mild oliguria.
- **Class 3**: 30-40% loss (1.5-2 L), characterized by severe tachycardia, tachypnea, depression, hypotension, and mental status changes.
- **Class 4**: Over 40% loss (>2 L), resulting in severe hypotension, confusion, agitation, obtundation, and potential unconsciousness.

If not promptly recognized and treated, decompensation can lead to cellular damage, inflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction. Internal bleeding and plasma losses are harder to diagnose than external hemorrhage. Key diagnostic considerations include:
- Vital signs may vary when the patient is upright.
- Capillary refill time is unreliable.
- Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels remain stable initially due to compensatory mechanisms.
- Plasma loss can cause hemoconcentration, complicating diagnosis.

Early detection and management are crucial to prevent progression to more severe shock stages.
