Einstein wrote about the photoelectric effect already in 1905, but it was only in the 1920s that it really became evident that the photon light is also a particle.
And what added to this photoelectric effect was the Compton effect by Arthur Compton. He showed that if he had an incident X-ray and it struck a free electron, such in graphite, that the electron recoils in a certain direction and this wave, the X-ray wave there also reflected.
And if you drew a line, an incident line of this X-ray, and then the new direction of it that made an angle, we'll call that angle theta.
And that reminds us of the collision of two objects. And as much as we had the preservation of energy, so energy initial must be called energy fine, but also momentum.
Now, this electron has mass, and it has scattered. And for that to happen, that means this incident X-ray should also have had momentum.
Because momentum before, this was stationary, this was moving, so this was zero, so for this to have momentum, this also had to have momentum.
Now, if we look at momentum of a relativistic particle, we remember that that's mv divided by 1 minus v squared over c squared.
Clearly, that is for a particle, clearly that is for a particle, and it cannot be the momentum of a photon, because a photon will have c squared over c squared, 1 minus 0 is 0, square root of 0 is 0, you can't divide by 0.
And the energy of a relativistic particle. And the energy of a relativistic particle is going to be mc squared divided by the square root of 1 minus v squared over c squared.
Again, that's not the energy of a photon. We know that the energy of a photon equals plums constant times its frequency.
And that equals plums constant times c divided by its wavelength. Remember that. But we have to do something to get an equation for, and one of the previous videos I think we saw was plums constant divided by lambda, divided by the wavelength, but how do we get to that equation?
I think what we can do. I think what we can do, we can do e over c squared equals, if I bring the c squared down, it's going to equal m over 1 minus v squared over c squared, because certainly that's something I need to get rid of in as much as I need to make v squared, v equals c.
And there's an m squared over c squared, and there's an m squared over c squared, so I can write p equals, there's a v, but instead of this m over this, I'm going to write e over c, c squared, c squared.
Okay. Now, I can write this as momentum for a electromagnetic wave, for a third one, and as much as v can now equal c, so I'm going to write it with momentum equals, that becomes c, that's e over c.
Together with this, I also know that c equals f times lambda, which I can replace there, values for e and c, in other words, p equals hf divided by c as lambda f, those will cancel out, in other words, p equals plums constant divided by the wavelength.
That gives us momentum, that gives us momentum, momentum of an electromagnetic wave, seen as a, not as a wave, but as a particle.
Now we have an equation to show that it does have momentum, and we can have conservation of linear momentum, in as much as the momentum initially will be the momentum of this, the momentum of the still-staying electron is zero,
zero, and now this, and this, these two momentums must now equal each other, because the electron has now gained momentum, that means this particle should have lost momentum, for it to lose momentum, for this p-value to go down, that means, for this to be a smaller number, the wavelength must increase.
The wavelength must increase, and if the wavelength increases, wavelength increases, its energy will also go down, in as much as wavelength is in the denominator.
Now there is an equation, that relates, this wavelength, to this initial wavelength, to this final wavelength, in as much as we have the final wavelength, minus the initial wavelength, is going to be h over mc, one minus the cosine of theta.
Now first of all think, that the cosine, varies between positive one, and negative one, negative one would mean, 180 degrees for this angle, meaning this x-ray, just rebalanced completely, not to worry about that nerve, what you might worry about, is this h over mc, what is the mass, that we're dealing with, and that is the mass, of this electron.
Okay, and this h over mc, that is known as the Compton, the Compton, Wavelength of the electron, Wavelength of the electron, Compton Wavelength of the electron, so we put the mass of the electron there, then you might ask yourself, what if we put a proton in here, if we put a proton in here, the mass will be much larger,
but it's in the denominator, meaning that the difference between these two, the difference between these two, will actually be less, if I use the mass of a proton, then if I scatter off of a proton, I'm going to get a difference between final and initial wavelength, to be a lot less.
A few more concepts that we want to add here, first of all, we've also got to look at the energy involved, so there'll be no, the initial energy will just be the energy of this photon coming in, the energy of that still standing particle, half mb squared, or relativistically there, but it's zero, in as much as,
this particle is standing still, and now that's got to equal final energy, which is going to be the energy of this x-ray, plus the kinetic energy of, kinetic energy of that moving electron, so if we knew these two, the wavelength of these two, we can work out what the kinetic energy is going to be of that scattered electron.
One thing that is in most textbooks, is the solar sail, or CNET, working on experiments to make massively large, really light sails, to put in front of spaceships, and electromagnetic waves off of the star, off of the sun then, supposed to be a propulsion,
you know, you know, a propulsion engine, engine for a spacecraft.
Count Dooku used it in Star Wars, of course, to escape to Coruscant. Anyway, where were we? If you have the sail, you have the sun, now, the question is always asked, should this sail be black, or should it be silver? You know from the movies, obviously, and from seeing some documentaries, where they look at this research, it's obviously,
metallic, metallic, and why is that so? And the answer given in most textbooks, if you think about the roof of a car, about the roof of a car, and hailstones hitting the car, and we think about the impulse of that hailstone, and its change, how that relates to the change in momentum, so let's just draw this,
let's just swing the axis around, so it's this, or we can use a tennis ball, going in this direction would be MV, and going back would be MV', but if we take this to be the positive velocity,
the positive direction for the velocity, so final minus initial, will be this MV, that is going to equal minus 2 MV.
Okay, whereas if it is a raindrop, and it just splats, and it just sticks there, there will be 0 minus MV, so its change in momentum is only going to be minus 1 MV. So this change in momentum is larger if there is,
if it bounces off completely, and the same happens there. If the sail was black, the photon would have been absorbed, so its change in momentum would only have been,
you can't say 1 MV, because we are dealing with the photon here, but you can see, that the change in momentum would be less, as if it bounces off.
So if the sunlight strikes it perpendicular, and bounces off, the change in momentum is going to be more, so we want this silver.
Then you'll usually get a question as you get these little glass balls, and inside of them they've got these,
they've got these little black on one side, silver on the one side, little square blocks, and if you put them in light they spin around, but you'll notice that they spin from black,
from the black side towards the silver side, so there's no Compton effect going on here, otherwise it would have gone from the silver side spinning towards the black side.
So there's something else obviously at work there, there's no Compton effect at work there.
An X-ray has a wavelength of 0.450 nanometers, and it scatters off of a still standing free electron.
Now this is the start of our problems, I just want to say do not get confused between this and the photoelectric effect,
where we shone the light, usually UV light onto a metal, and we scattered a photoelectron.
There was no scattering of that, scattering of that incident wave, inasmuch as it was used up to give kinetic energy to the photoelectron,
to overcome that work function. This scattering is something different, Compton scattering is something different.
So we have an X-ray wavelength out there, it scatters straight back. If it scatters straight back, what is the,
theta angle going to be, well that's 180 degrees, inasmuch as if we have the incident, and if it scatters straight back,
the electron is now going to do something that's going to have some velocity, and that's what we want from the velocity, from this problem.
So, first of all we've just got to look at, I think, at the, let's look at the energies involved. So the energy has got to equal the energy final.
The energy of the incoming, the energy of the incoming, the energy of the incoming wavelength will be HF, and let's rewrite that as because we are dealing with wavelength, and that's HC over lambda.
So, there is no energy, there is no energy in the still standing free electron, so it's half mb squared is zero.
So that's got to equal the energy after the collision, and the energy after the collision is going to be this energy of this new wavelength,
plus the kinetic energy, plus the kinetic energy, plus the kinetic energy of the electron.
And we want velocity, so it's part of this, so kinetic energy is going to equal this minus that, bring it over to the other side,
so we're going to take HC out as a common factor, that would be one over lambda minus one over lambda prime.
Kinetic energy, now these kind of problems, we won't deal with relativistic velocity, so we're just going to deal with half mb squared.
So kinetic energy is going to be half mb squared, and we are interested in that v squared, or v.
So v is going to equal two times HC, we're going to take that over to the other side,
one over lambda minus one over lambda one, lambda prime, divided by the mass, and all of this squared, because it's velocity squared.
One thing we don't have is lambda prime. Fortunately, we do know that lambda prime minus lambda equals the Compton wavelength of the electron,
which is h over mc, one minus cosine of that angle. Cosine of 180 degrees is negative one, one minus negative one is two.
So this is going to equal two h over mc. In other words, lambda prime is going to equal lambda plus two h over mc.
And if I plug this into my equation here, and if I plug this into my equation here, I'm going to get velocity equals the square root of
2hc, one over lambda minus one over lambda prime is now this, lambda plus two h over mc.
Or that divided by m. So that's my final equation for velocity. And my answer to this velocity of this electron is going to be 3.22 times 10 to the power is 6 meters per second.
Certainly not anywhere near relativistic speeds. So we're only dealing here with half equals mv squared for the kinetic energy.
So that I think is one large enclosure and a fearärども is still compatible.
Not everybody knows how to go with a little lastly, but it comes to the power phosphate rate when it comes to the power zone.
So that's a bit too extreme energy. I mean, just say no.
So we don't see how to tour. Outside of the водuousИm�� düşers are being AG2 and
is exactly the moment you can think of anything else that doesn't exist.
All right.
