The text highlights the importance of identifying diabetic patients in surgical practice due to their common comorbid complications, particularly vascular issues affecting the brain, heart, kidneys, and extremities. Diabetics experience fluid shifts, osmotic diuresis, and electrolyte imbalances, increasing risks for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia during surgery. They also have immune deficits leading to higher rates of post-operative infections and slower wound healing, impacting surgical outcomes like anastomosis.

Diagnosis involves recognizing known diabetes symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss, particularly in overweight patients at risk for type 2 diabetes. A careful history and physical examination are crucial, along with initial urinalysis using dipsticks in some institutions. Screening tools, including online calculators that assess risk factors like age, sex, family history, and lifestyle, can aid diagnosis.

For suspected diabetics, fasting glucose levels and glucose tolerance tests are recommended over HbA1c for surgical management decisions. Diabetic patients undergoing surgery should be evaluated for cardiac issues with a stress ECG and renal function through blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolyte testing. This comprehensive approach helps manage their higher morbidity and mortality risks effectively.

In surgical practice, it's crucial to identify diabetic patients due to their associated comorbid complications resulting from vascular effects. Diabetics often experience microvascular issues affecting the brain, heart (leading to cardiac problems), kidneys, and peripheral regions. They also face fluid shifts caused by osmotic diuresis with glucose and electrolyte imbalances when given insulin.

These patients are at risk of both hypoglycemia (from excessive insulin or insufficient glucose) and hyperglycemia (if blood sugar control is poor), which can lead to acidosis and shock. Diabetics also suffer from immune deficits, including abnormalities in polymorphonucleus cells that impair appropriate cellular attraction to infection sites and phagocytic issues, increasing the likelihood of post-operative septic complications like wound infections. These factors contribute to poorer healing rates, particularly relevant for surgical procedures such as anastomosis, ultimately leading to higher morbidity and mortality.

To diagnose diabetes, healthcare providers should inquire about patients' history with diabetes, including type, duration, medication, and comorbid conditions. Not all patients may be aware of their diabetic status, necessitating careful history-taking and physical examinations for everyone. Initial consultations might include urinalysis for early detection via dipsticks. Symptoms like polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), and unexplained weight loss can indicate diabetes, especially type 1.

Overweight patients are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, with known risk factors including age, sex, family history, and exercise levels. An online calculator is available to assess risk. Diabetic prevalence is notable in vascular surgery patients (up to 20%) and those on high-dose corticosteroids (up to 50%).

Suspected diabetic patients should undergo fasting glucose tests or glucose tolerance tests for confirmation, while HbA1c tests are not recommended as they do not significantly influence surgical management. Once diagnosed, a comprehensive assessment of the heart and kidneys is suggested pre-surgery, potentially including stress ECGs and renal function tests to evaluate blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine levels, and electrolytes.
