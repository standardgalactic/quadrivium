The text highlights the importance of identifying diabetic patients in surgical practice due to their common comorbid complications, particularly vascular issues affecting the brain, heart, kidneys, and extremities. Diabetics experience fluid shifts, osmotic diuresis, and electrolyte imbalances, increasing risks for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia during surgery. They also have immune deficits leading to higher rates of post-operative infections and slower wound healing, impacting surgical outcomes like anastomosis.

Diagnosis involves recognizing known diabetes symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss, particularly in overweight patients at risk for type 2 diabetes. A careful history and physical examination are crucial, along with initial urinalysis using dipsticks in some institutions. Screening tools, including online calculators that assess risk factors like age, sex, family history, and lifestyle, can aid diagnosis.

For suspected diabetics, fasting glucose levels and glucose tolerance tests are recommended over HbA1c for surgical management decisions. Diabetic patients undergoing surgery should be evaluated for cardiac issues with a stress ECG and renal function through blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolyte testing. This comprehensive approach helps manage their higher morbidity and mortality risks effectively.
