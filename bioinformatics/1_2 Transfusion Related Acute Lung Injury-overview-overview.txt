Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a severe complication arising from blood product transfusions, characterized by sudden onset of lung injury. It was defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Working Group and endorsed at a Canadian Consensus Conference.

**Pathogenesis:** The precise cause of TRALI remains unclear but involves hypotheses centered around granulocytes and anti-granulocyte antibodies: 1) reactions between donor plasma antibodies and recipient's granulocytes; 2) substances like lipids and cytokines in donor plasma that increase pulmonary vascular permeability; or a combination of these factors (two-event hypothesis).

**Epidemiology:** TRALI is under-recognized due to diagnostic challenges, occurring at an incidence rate of 1 in 2,500 transfusions. It is a leading cause of transfusion-related mortality and affects all age groups equally among both genders.

**Risk Factors:** Risk factors include prolonged blood product storage, recent surgery (particularly liver), hematological malignancies, thrombocytopenia or massive transfusion, active infection, sepsis, high Apache 2 scores, chronic alcohol abuse, and multiple pregnancies in female donors. These do not consistently correlate with anti-granulocyte antibody levels.

**Clinical Presentation:** Symptoms generally appear one to two hours post-transfusion but can occur up to six hours later, including respiratory distress, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, pulmonary edema, high peak pressure if intubated, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray.

**Diagnosis:** Diagnosis involves identifying symptoms within six hours of transfusion while excluding pre-existing lung injury or other risk factors. It is differentiated from Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO) by the absence of circulatory overload and includes criteria such as bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a PAO2-FIO2 ratio less than 300 mmHg or oxygen saturation below 90%.

**Management:** Management follows acute lung injury protocols, potentially including diuretics for suspected cardiac overload. Further transfusions from implicated donors should be avoided, and the blood bank must be informed. Strategies might involve selecting plasma only from male donors or excluding women with multiple pregnancies from donating.

TRALI's diagnosis is complex due to symptom overlap with other conditions, necessitating careful clinical assessment and management protocols.
