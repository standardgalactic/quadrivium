This video covers the use of radioactive iodine-131 in treating Graves' disease, a therapy introduced in the 1940s. This isotope undergoes beta decay (which destroys tissue) and gamma decay (used for imaging), with an 8-day half-life, transforming iodine into xenon-131, a beta particle, and antineutrinos. The thyroid concentrates radioactive iodine, which can cause side effects like gastritis and salivary adenitis. It also crosses into breast milk and the placenta, so it is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women unless treatment occurs before fetal thyroid concentration starts around week 12. Long-term safety concerns include potential malignancies, reproductive issues, and impacts on children, although conclusive evidence is limited.

Treatment with thionamides before radioactive iodine can reduce its effectiveness, but short-term pre-treatment has little impact. Radioactive iodine therapy is typically started soon after diagnosis of Graves' disease, but severe cases may require initial use of thionamides. Over time, most patients develop hypothyroidism and might experience worsening eye problems (ophthalmopathy), particularly with higher doses.

Following treatment, patients often see a reduction in thyroid size and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, which can be managed with propranolol and thionamides if necessary. A small number may worsen shortly after treatment, requiring standard management for thyrotoxicosis. If additional treatment is needed, it should not occur before 6 months.

Administration involves strict regulations globally, with local radiotherapist policies guiding its use regarding thionamide co-administration, dosage, patient isolation post-treatment, and follow-up care. The next video will discuss surgical resection as another treatment option for Graves' disease.
