The text describes how to approximate the area under a curve using the trapezoidal rule by dividing the region into trapezoids with equal bases of width \(\Delta x\). The formula for calculating each trapezoid's area is \(\frac{\Delta x (y_0 + y_1)}{2}\), where \(y_0\) and \(y_1\) are adjacent y-values. By factoring out \(\Delta x/2\), we obtain the trapezoidal sums equation, which averages left and right Riemann sums. The method is presented as a precursor to more detailed discussions or videos on sums.
