The text outlines a method for solving differential equations by modeling situations where a variable's rate of change is proportional to a function of that variable. Specifically, it examines temperature changes over time, expressed as being directly proportional to \(100 - \text{temperature}\). The process involves:

1. **Modeling the Situation**: Describing how temperature changes with respect to time using the differential equation:
   \[
   \frac{dt}{dx} = k(100 - t)
   \]
   which can be rewritten as a linear differential equation by substituting variables:
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} + ky = 100k
   \]

2. **Solving the Equation**: 
   - Recognize it as a linear differential equation.
   - Use an integrating factor, \(e^{kx}\), to facilitate solving:
     \[
     e^{kx} \frac{dy}{dx} + k e^{kx} y = 100k e^{kx}
     \]
   - Integrate both sides to find:
     \[
     e^{kx} y = 100 e^{kx} + C
     \]
   - Solve for \(y\):
     \[
     y = 100 + \frac{C}{e^{kx}}
     \]

3. **Returning to Original Variables**: Replace the variables back to express temperature as a function of time:
   \[
   t(x) = 100 + \frac{C}{e^{kx}}
   \]

4. **Application**: The solution predicts temperature at any given time \(t\). By using experimental data, specific values for the constant \(C\) can be determined, allowing the model to apply to real-world scenarios.

This method demonstrates how differential equations can effectively model and solve practical problems by incorporating constants of proportionality and integrating factors.
