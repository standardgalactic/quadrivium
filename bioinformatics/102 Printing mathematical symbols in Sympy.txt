and here we are in lecture two we're going to look at printing now printing as far as ipython
notebook is concerned means printing to the screen think of it this way you use a word processing
program and you say file print and instead of printing to a physical printer depending on your
operating system and how it's set up you can print to pdf the same happens here and simpy has
various printers instead of printing an answer to my code i can have a print latex code which i then
can then use somewhere else so there's a variety of printers available in simpy here i'm going to do
as you can see this line here is going to indicate indicate to this ipython notebook that i want to do
what is referred to as pretty printing so i'm going to say import simpy as sym just an abbreviation for
this namespace and then i'm going to invoke this pretty printing and tell this notebook that i won
sym so referring to simpy dot init underscore printing open and close parentheses then i'm going to set up
my symbols x y z r theta now look at that theta there's a variety or a long list of words that i can use in
simpy that will export the symbol for that word now remember the variable here the first one maps to
the first symbol there the second variable maps to the second symbol there note the commas here note no
commas there and i have theta here and theta there now i'm just simply going to print to the screen theta
cubed let's see what that looks like beautiful as if you've written it on paper in beautiful
handwriting that really is pretty printing so remember we can factorize so i have 2x squared
plus xy it's going to factorize by taking x out as a common factor leaving me with x and then 2x plus y
and i can print that out so because i've invoked this pretty printing here everything that gets printed to
the screen now will be done with pretty printing and indeed i i have the x and 2x plus y let's look
at integration i'm going to print the string the indefinite integral dot and i have some dot integral
now we're going to get to differentiation and integration but look here i've got integral with
a capital i and i'm going to say x cubed comma x that means the indefinite integral of x cubed with respect
to x so i just have my expression there comma with respect to what i want to integrate and if i were
to run that look at that is that not a thing of beauty integral of x cubed with respect to x
i can also do the definite integral i'm going to do a and b as symbols a and b and i'm going to say
sim dot integral again my expression there x cubed comma now i have to put this part in parentheses still
with respect to x and i have my lower bound and then upper bound so if i were to print that look
at that the definite integral of x cubed with respect to x going from a to b now there is a keyword just
integrate that we can use here that will actually do the integration for me but i can also use this
formal integral and just put the dot do it with open and close parentheses at the back and that will
actually just solve that integral for me this is not the usual way of doing it but i can have the
printing and then just say dot do it and it will just do the integral for me let's look at the
derivative sim dot derivative with a capital d there it's y cubed with respect to y so just comma y
and lo and behold look at that i needn't just take the first derivative though what if i wanted the
third derivative so here i have x plus y cubed with respect to y three times i'm just going to y y y
y and then just hit enter and look lo and behold look how pretty this is so i have a partial derivative
because it's with respect to y but i have another symbol in the x so that is a third partial derivative
with respect to y of x plus y cubed now in this last section of code here i'm again going to do the
derivative of y cubed and now i needn't put y y y i could also have just said y let's just do that
three if i do that it is going to still do the third derivative so i can also do it here but i can
also do the dot do it so it's just going to do the second derivative of y cubed with respect to y
for me and just give me the answer now just getting back i just wanted to show you alpha comma alpha
comma beta comma beta and let's map that to symbols and remember parentheses and my quotation marks alpha
alpha lower uppercase and lowercase beta and beta so we can do that and now if i were to print alpha
i have the remember if i'm in a cell and i want to execute that cell i can either press the run button
there or i can hit shift enter and lo and behold there's a capital alpha and lowercase alpha there's
my lowercase alpha uppercase beta and my lowercase beta done all done now through pretty printing and
and that is mightily impressive indeed
you
