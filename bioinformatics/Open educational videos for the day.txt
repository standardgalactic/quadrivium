There you go, another fantastic run in Newlands Forest.
Another glorious day here in Cape Town and I bring you the good news of two new lectures on my channel.
I continue with abstract algebra, one of my favourite topics in mathematics.
And yesterday I uploaded eventually, or I would say eventually, the end of or where we were trying to get with cosets
and that is Lagrange's theorem for finite groups.
Have a look at that one from yesterday, I'll put the link up there and it'll be in the description down below as well.
So today I build on what we learned from cosets and Lagrange's theorem
and that is where I start looking at what a quotient group is.
And it's really simple, it really just follows on from cosets and Lagrange's theorem.
You'll find it's so easy to understand, even the proofs that are in there is really easy to understand.
And then I decided to start making some more videos in my series on Let's Talk Surgery.
And it's part one of talking about acute appendicitis where I just look at,
just discuss very informally the anatomy and how the anatomy really helps you to think about the symptoms and signs of acute appendicitis.
So also up there, have a look at that.
I'll try and see you tomorrow.
I'll try and see you tomorrow.
