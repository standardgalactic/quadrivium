The talk focuses on a project initiated in the Acute Care Surgery Unit at Grutuskeer Hospital, where gamification was used to increase student involvement. The presenter, Jean, introduces herself as the head of this surgery unit and outlines the unit’s role in managing patients requiring urgent surgery.

Gamification, which originated from digital media in 2008, involves applying game elements like point scoring and competition to non-game contexts to enhance engagement. While primarily used for marketing, gamification has potential applications in academic settings by making learning more engaging.

Jean explores how gamification could be adapted to a professional medical education context while maintaining professionalism given the seriousness of patient care. She references research on society's adoption of gaming elements (like those seen on Facebook) and their psychological impacts. The talk also questions if traditional educational methods resemble gamification with their structured rules and assessments.

Jean’s project aims to integrate game mechanics such as rules, badges, point scores, leaderboards, and the enjoyment derived from them, to motivate students in achieving learning goals. She outlines two potential objectives for gamification: improving students' knowledge for better exam performance or enhancing critical thinking skills to make them better doctors. Jean emphasizes a scholarly approach to implementing gamification on a larger scale, ensuring that its effects are measured against these defined goals.

The text outlines thoughts and considerations for implementing gamification in an academic setting, specifically within a healthcare education context. The author emphasizes the importance of enhancing students' critical thinking and performance through game-like elements without compromising professionalism in clinical environments.

Key points include:

1. **Objective and Design**: The primary goal is to improve student engagement and behavior rather than just imparting knowledge. This involves designing an experience that subtly incorporates gamification, potentially altering how students perceive their tasks and responsibilities.

2. **Research and Mechanics**: Understanding game mechanics is crucial for determining the impact on student interaction and performance. Research into both psychological dynamics and successful game design elements from commercial games will guide this process.

3. **Platform and Implementation**: A digital platform is preferred over an analog system due to ease of use, maintenance, and familiarity among students who are accustomed to digital environments. The author considers using their private website with WordPress for implementation.

4. **Professional Setting Considerations**: While maintaining the professional atmosphere necessary in clinical settings like wards and operating theaters, elements of playfulness should be used to motivate students without undermining the seriousness required when dealing with patients.

5. **Teacher's Role and Education Goals**: The text underscores the influence teachers have over student behavior and learning, emphasizing careful design to avoid educational mistakes. Specific goals are set to address issues such as limited patient contact and insufficient participation in theater activities due to other academic commitments.

Overall, the author plans a structured approach to gamification aimed at enhancing student experiences and outcomes in healthcare education while navigating professional constraints.

The text describes an educational initiative to enhance medical students' experience and engagement through gamification. The main goals were to increase participation during rounds, improve practical skills by assisting in surgeries (scrubbing up), and encourage reading beyond prescribed materials. This was particularly important due to the lack of senior support in rural healthcare settings in South Africa.

To achieve these objectives, a gamified project was designed using an online forum on a WordPress blog. Students were encouraged to share their clinical experiences, discuss surgical cases, and review medical literature with colleagues through this platform. They earned points for various activities: presenting patients during rounds, assisting in surgeries, reading and discussing articles, asking questions, and answering peers' queries.

The scoring system prioritized certain actions based on importance—assisting in surgeries scored the highest, followed by discussions about read articles and academic question exchanges. This gamification resulted in active participation and knowledge sharing among students, who otherwise remained quiet during traditional ward rounds. The online forum was highly effective in fostering engagement and accurately reflecting the students' understanding and skills, with minimal intervention required from the moderator to correct inaccuracies. A scoreboard visible on the blog tracked their progress, motivating them by showing real-time standings.

The text outlines challenges faced in managing a system where students were assigned usernames and passwords, initially leading to security issues with unauthorized access. The situation improved when usernames and passwords were distributed as physical copies rather than being available online for self-registration.

Managing the forum required significant time investment, as each post needed daily evaluation based on its content—such as case discussions, questions, or article summaries—which was labor-intensive but ultimately rewarding due to positive feedback and high student engagement. The experience enhanced professional interactions among students in clinical settings like ward rounds and theaters, without adding extra burdens beyond existing requirements. Students naturally integrated the system into their routine using smartphones and tablets, showing enthusiasm similar to that for social media platforms. Overall, the project was considered a success and laid groundwork for future research and larger initiatives.
