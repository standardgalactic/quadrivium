The talk focuses on a project initiated in the Acute Care Surgery Unit at Grutuskeer Hospital, where gamification was used to increase student involvement. The presenter, Jean, introduces herself as the head of this surgery unit and outlines the unit’s role in managing patients requiring urgent surgery.

Gamification, which originated from digital media in 2008, involves applying game elements like point scoring and competition to non-game contexts to enhance engagement. While primarily used for marketing, gamification has potential applications in academic settings by making learning more engaging.

Jean explores how gamification could be adapted to a professional medical education context while maintaining professionalism given the seriousness of patient care. She references research on society's adoption of gaming elements (like those seen on Facebook) and their psychological impacts. The talk also questions if traditional educational methods resemble gamification with their structured rules and assessments.

Jean’s project aims to integrate game mechanics such as rules, badges, point scores, leaderboards, and the enjoyment derived from them, to motivate students in achieving learning goals. She outlines two potential objectives for gamification: improving students' knowledge for better exam performance or enhancing critical thinking skills to make them better doctors. Jean emphasizes a scholarly approach to implementing gamification on a larger scale, ensuring that its effects are measured against these defined goals.

The text outlines thoughts and considerations for implementing gamification in an academic setting, specifically within a healthcare education context. The author emphasizes the importance of enhancing students' critical thinking and performance through game-like elements without compromising professionalism in clinical environments.

Key points include:

1. **Objective and Design**: The primary goal is to improve student engagement and behavior rather than just imparting knowledge. This involves designing an experience that subtly incorporates gamification, potentially altering how students perceive their tasks and responsibilities.

The text describes an educational initiative to enhance medical students' experience and engagement through gamification. The main goals were to increase participation during rounds, improve practical skills by assisting in surgeries (scrubbing up), and encourage reading beyond prescribed materials. This was particularly important due to the lack of senior support in rural healthcare settings in South Africa.

To achieve these objectives, a gamified project was designed using an online forum on a WordPress blog. Students were encouraged to share their clinical experiences, discuss surgical cases, and review medical literature with colleagues through this platform. They earned points for various activities: presenting patients during rounds, assisting in surgeries, reading and discussing articles, asking questions, and answering peers' queries.

The scoring system prioritized certain actions based on importance—assisting in surgeries scored the highest, followed by discussions about read articles and academic question exchanges. This gamification resulted in active participation and knowledge sharing among students, who otherwise remained quiet during traditional ward rounds. The online forum was highly effective in fostering engagement and accurately reflecting the students' understanding and skills, with minimal intervention required from the moderator to correct inaccuracies. A scoreboard visible on the blog tracked their progress, motivating them by showing real-time standings.

The text outlines challenges faced in managing a system where students were assigned usernames and passwords, initially leading to security issues with unauthorized access. The situation improved when usernames and passwords were distributed as physical copies rather than being available online for self-registration.

Managing the forum required significant time investment, as each post needed daily evaluation based on its content—such as case discussions, questions, or article summaries—which was labor-intensive but ultimately rewarding due to positive feedback and high student engagement. The experience enhanced professional interactions among students in clinical settings like ward rounds and theaters, without adding extra burdens beyond existing requirements. Students naturally integrated the system into their routine using smartphones and tablets, showing enthusiasm similar to that for social media platforms. Overall, the project was considered a success and laid groundwork for future research and larger initiatives.

The talk outlines a project launched in the Acute Care Surgery Unit at Grutuskeer Hospital, where gamification was used to engage medical students more deeply. Jean, head of the unit, introduces himself and describes how they aim to provide urgent surgical care while incorporating an educational program for final-year medical students from the University of Cape Town.

Jean explains that gamification involves applying game elements like point scoring, competition, and rules to non-game contexts, originally emerging from digital media rather than academia. He expresses caution about using gamification in a professional setting but sees potential benefits for student engagement.

The presentation explores how gamification is used broadly (e.g., Facebook's features) and its psychological impacts. Jean questions if academic education already employs elements of gamification through grading systems, likening them to game mechanics. He stresses the importance of rigorous research before fully implementing gamification in an educational context.

Jean outlines his goals: improving students' knowledge for exams or enhancing their critical thinking to become better doctors. The talk highlights ongoing research into how desirable gaming experiences can translate into academic settings and underscores the need for scholarly evaluation when scaling up gamification initiatives.

The speaker is considering how gamification can be integrated into medical education to enhance student engagement, improve patient interaction experiences, and encourage participation in practical activities such as theater work.

The text outlines an initiative to enhance medical students' practical experience and engagement through gamification. In South Africa, particularly in rural healthcare settings, junior doctors often lack senior guidance and require exposure to real cases, especially emergencies, for better learning.

To address this, the author set three goals: increase patient presentations during rounds, involve students more actively in surgical theaters ("scrubbing up"), and encourage reading beyond prescribed materials. The approach involved a gamification project using a WordPress-based online forum where students earned points by engaging with these activities:

1. **Presenting on Rounds**: Students were encouraged to see and present more patients, gaining experience.
2. **Assisting in Surgery**: Active participation in surgeries was incentivized, with discussions about cases contributing to their scores.
3. **Reading Literature**: Students summarized and discussed at least one review journal article with peers.

Points were awarded for various activities: presenting patient cases, discussing surgical experiences, asking questions, and responding to others' queries on the forum. The points system prioritized certain actions more heavily, such as scrubbing in surgery or engaging deeply with literature discussions.

This gamification strategy resulted in increased student participation both online and offline. Notably, it fostered a vibrant exchange of ideas and questions among students, which was less evident during traditional ward rounds. Students seemed motivated to provide accurate answers on the forum, ensuring correctness by reading up before responding. The initiative demonstrated how gamification could effectively enhance learning and engagement in medical education settings.

The text discusses the initial challenges faced in managing a system where students were given usernames and passwords, leading to security issues with unauthorized access. To address this, the instructor assigned usernames and passwords via paper, rather than online registration, enhancing control over access.

Managing the forum was time-consuming, requiring constant monitoring of student posts and daily scoring based on their contributions—such as asking or answering questions, writing summaries, or discussing specific topics like theater cases.

Despite these challenges, the experience proved rewarding. It resulted in positive engagement from students, who were more involved in practical settings such as ward rounds and surgeries, receiving recognition for their active participation. Importantly, this initiative did not add to the students' existing workload; it seamlessly integrated into their routine through smartphones and tablets, similar to using social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.

Overall, the experience maintained professionalism without imposing additional burdens on students, showing promising results that encouraged plans for future research and larger projects.
