The text discusses a method for solving differential equations by modeling real-life situations where the rate of change of a variable is proportional to a certain function of that variable. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Real-Life Modeling**: The problem involves modeling a situation where the rate of change of temperature over time is directly proportional to \(100 - \text{temperature}\).

2. **Differential Equation Setup**: This relationship is expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{dt}{dx} = k(100 - t)
   \]
   By substituting \(t\) for \(y\) and \(x\) for \(t\), it becomes:
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} + ky = 100k
   \]

3. **Solving the Equation**: 
   - Recognize this as a linear differential equation.
   - Use an integrating factor, \(e^{kx}\), to simplify and solve:
     \[
     e^{kx} \frac{dy}{dx} + k e^{kx} y = 100k e^{kx}
     \]
   - Integrate both sides:
     \[
     e^{kx} y = 100 e^{kx} + C
     \]
   - Solve for \(y\):
     \[
     y = 100 + \frac{C}{e^{kx}}
     \]

4. **Reverting Variables**: Replace back to original variables:
   \[
   t(x) = 100 + \frac{C}{e^{kx}}
   \]

5. **Application**: This solution allows predicting the temperature at any time \(t\). By using experimental data points, specific values of the constant \(C\) can be determined, making the model applicable to real-world scenarios.

The approach illustrates how differential equations can model and solve practical problems by introducing constants of proportionality and integrating factors.

The text discusses solving a differential equation modeling a real-life scenario where the rate of change of a variable (e.g., temperature) is directly proportional to \(100\) minus that variable. The approach taken involves using a constant of proportionality, denoted as \(k\), leading to the linear first-order differential equation:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} + ky = 100k
\]

To solve this, an integrating factor method is applied, resulting in:

\[
e^{kx}\frac{dy}{dx} + ke^{kx}y = 100ke^{kx}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}(e^{kx}y) = 100ke^{kx}
\]

Integrating both sides gives the solution:

\[
e^{kx}y = 100e^{kx} + C
\]

Solving for \(y\) yields:

\[
y = 100 + \frac{C}{e^{kx}}
\]

Replacing back with the original variable, this becomes:

\[
t(t) = 100 + \frac{c}{e^{kt}}
\]

This solution represents a family of curves dependent on the constant \(c\), which can be determined using initial conditions or data points from experiments. The process demonstrates how differential equations can model and solve real-life problems involving proportional rates of change.
