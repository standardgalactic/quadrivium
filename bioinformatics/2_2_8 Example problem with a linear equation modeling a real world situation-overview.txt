The text discusses a method for solving differential equations by modeling real-life situations where the rate of change of a variable is proportional to a certain function of that variable. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Real-Life Modeling**: The problem involves modeling a situation where the rate of change of temperature over time is directly proportional to \(100 - \text{temperature}\).

2. **Differential Equation Setup**: This relationship is expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{dt}{dx} = k(100 - t)
   \]
   By substituting \(t\) for \(y\) and \(x\) for \(t\), it becomes:
   \[
   \frac{dy}{dx} + ky = 100k
   \]

3. **Solving the Equation**: 
   - Recognize this as a linear differential equation.
   - Use an integrating factor, \(e^{kx}\), to simplify and solve:
     \[
     e^{kx} \frac{dy}{dx} + k e^{kx} y = 100k e^{kx}
     \]
   - Integrate both sides:
     \[
     e^{kx} y = 100 e^{kx} + C
     \]
   - Solve for \(y\):
     \[
     y = 100 + \frac{C}{e^{kx}}
     \]

4. **Reverting Variables**: Replace back to original variables:
   \[
   t(x) = 100 + \frac{C}{e^{kx}}
   \]

5. **Application**: This solution allows predicting the temperature at any time \(t\). By using experimental data points, specific values of the constant \(C\) can be determined, making the model applicable to real-world scenarios.

The approach illustrates how differential equations can model and solve practical problems by introducing constants of proportionality and integrating factors.
