This text introduces a course called "Physics 1," which aims to teach students how to think like real physicists. Unlike traditional physics courses that focus on learning and applying equations, this course emphasizes understanding the process of developing these equations and using them innovatively in fields such as quantum mechanics and high-energy physics.

The author highlights the importance of combining mathematics with physics education since they are fundamentally interconnected. The goal is to teach students to apply mathematical concepts within physics, thereby enhancing their understanding.

The course is accessible to anyone interested in physicsâ€”whether a student following a prescribed curriculum or someone exploring independently through books and online resources. The narrative uses Elon Musk's example to illustrate the power of self-directed learning, suggesting that abundant resources are available today for those who seek them.

In this course, starting with lecture one, students will explore fundamental concepts such as laws of nature, Newton's laws of motion, conserved quantities, and symmetry principles. This approach differs from standard physics courses by focusing on deeper understanding rather than rote learning.

The text ends with motivational encouragement to pursue personal goals and seek new knowledge beyond traditional educational boundaries.
