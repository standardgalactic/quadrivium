Now that we've seen this first couple of examples, we need to move on to these trigonometric functions,
or these combined trigonometric polynomial functions.
Well, I shouldn't say polynomial here, they're all transcendental, well, I'd say that's transcendental and there's a polynomial.
e to the power alpha x cosine of bx, x with it, x squared, until x to the power n minus 1.
Same for sine, we have the annihilating operator as being d squared minus 2 times alpha d plus this alpha squared plus beta squared all to the power n,
which is just going to be one more, of course, than what is in there.
In the next video, we'll look at an example or two, I think.
