The lecture introduces Plotly, an online web service that enables users to create interactive graphs and plots. Users can import their data from various formats like spreadsheets into Plotly, which generates visually appealing visualizations. These plots are easily shareable with collaborators or others involved in the project, making it a useful tool for both collaboration and presentations. The speaker highlights the attractive and functional nature of Plotly's output and encourages viewers to explore its capabilities.
