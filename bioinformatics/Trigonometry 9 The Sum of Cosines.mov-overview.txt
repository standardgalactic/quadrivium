The video demonstrates how to derive expressions for the sum and difference of two cosine functions using trigonometric identities. The process involves setting \( a = x + y \) and \( b = x - y \), allowing algebraic manipulation to express \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \). The key steps include:

1. Solving for \( x \) and \( y \):
   - \( x = \frac{a + b}{2} \)
   - \( y = \frac{a - b}{2} \)

2. Using the trigonometric identity for cosine addition:
   - \( \cos(a) = \cos(x+y) = \cos(x)\cos(y) - \sin(x)\sin(y) \)
   - \( \cos(b) = \cos(x-y) = \cos(x)\cos(y) + \sin(x)\sin(y) \)

3. Deriving the sum and difference of cosines:
   - Sum: \( \cos(a) + \cos(b) = 2\cos(x)\cos(y) \)
   - Difference: \( \cos(a) - \cos(b) = -2\sin(x)\sin(y) \)

4. Substituting the expressions for \( x \) and \( y \):
   - Sum expression becomes: 
     \[
     \cos(a) + \cos(b) = 2 \cos\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{a-b}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Difference expression becomes:
     \[
     \cos(a) - \cos(b) = -2 \sin\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{a-b}{2}\right)
     \]

These results show how the sum and difference of two cosine functions can be expressed in terms of the cosines and sines of half-angles.
