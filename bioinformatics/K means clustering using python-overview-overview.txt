This text outlines the use of k-means clustering to analyze patient responses in a healthcare study involving smartwatch data collection. The study involves 99 patients who are prompted to sync their data through six types of reminder campaigns sent out over a year. The aim is to identify patterns in how different patients respond to these campaigns.

### Summary:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Two Excel sheets record campaign details and patient responses, which are merged into a comprehensive dataset.
   - A pivot table is created with patients as rows and campaigns as columns, marking non-responses as `NAN` and converting them to zeros for analysis.

2. **Clustering Process**:
   - K-means clustering (`k=5`) is performed using scikit-learn in Python to categorize patients based on their campaign response patterns.
   - This results in five clusters, chosen because it's fewer than the number of possible clusters (35).

3. **Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization**:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces data from 32 dimensions (campaigns) to two principal components for visualization.
   - An interactive scatter plot is created using Plotly, where each cluster is displayed in different colors and shapes based on PCA results.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Cluster analysis reveals specific response patterns; for example, Cluster 1 includes patients responsive to WhatsApp and telephone calls but less so to SMS pamphlets or long letters.
   - The study suggests tailoring future communications for these clusters accordingly (e.g., focusing on effective channels like WhatsApp for Cluster 1).
   - It highlights the presence of 49 patients in Cluster 1, allowing for targeted campaign strategies.

5. **Implementation Encouragement**:
   - The process is described as simple to implement using Python, encouraging others to replicate and apply this method for similar analyses in healthcare or business contexts.

This approach offers a strategic way to enhance patient engagement by understanding and leveraging their preferred communication channels.
