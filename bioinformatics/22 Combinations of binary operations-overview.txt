The text discusses the concept of distributive properties in binary operations beyond the familiar context of addition and multiplication. It introduces two types of distributive properties: left distributive and right distributive.

1. **Left Distributive Property**: For a binary operation * to be left distributive over another operation +, it must satisfy:
   \[
   A*(B+C) = (A*B) + (A*C)
   \]
   This means applying the operation * between \( A \) and the result of \( B+C \) should yield the same as performing * separately on \( A \) with \( B \) and \( C \), then adding the results.

2. **Right Distributive Property**: For a binary operation * to be right distributive over another operation +, it must satisfy:
   \[
   (B+C)*A = (B*A) + (C*A)
   \]
   This means applying the operation * between \( B+C \) and \( A \) should yield the same as performing * separately on \( B \) and \( C \) with \( A \), then adding the results.

The text provides an example using integers where one operation is addition (+) and the other is defined as \( x^2*y \). It demonstrates that:

- The operation \( x^2*y \) is left distributive over addition because:
  \[
  a*(b+c) = (a^2*b) + (a^2*c)
  \]
  matches the definition of the operation.

- However, it is not right distributive over addition because:
  \[
  (b+c)*a = b^2*a + c^2*a
  \]
  does not match \( b*a + c*a \).

This example illustrates that a binary operation can be left distributive without being right distributive with respect to another operation.
