The text discusses the concept of distributive properties in binary operations beyond the familiar context of addition and multiplication. It introduces two types of distributive properties: left distributive and right distributive.

1. **Left Distributive Property**: For a binary operation * to be left distributive over another operation +, it must satisfy:
   \[
   A*(B+C) = (A*B) + (A*C)
   \]
   This means applying the operation * between \( A \) and the result of \( B+C \) should yield the same as performing * separately on \( A \) with \( B \) and \( C \), then adding the results.

2. **Right Distributive Property**: For a binary operation * to be right distributive over another operation +, it must satisfy:
   \[
   (B+C)*A = (B*A) + (C*A)
   \]
   This means applying the operation * between \( B+C \) and \( A \) should yield the same as performing * separately on \( B \) and \( C \) with \( A \), then adding the results.

The text provides an example using integers where one operation is addition (+) and the other is defined as \( x^2*y \). It demonstrates that:

- The operation \( x^2*y \) is left distributive over addition because:
  \[
  a*(b+c) = (a^2*b) + (a^2*c)
  \]
  matches the definition of the operation.

- However, it is not right distributive over addition because:
  \[
  (b+c)*a = b^2*a + c^2*a
  \]
  does not match \( b*a + c*a \).

This example illustrates that a binary operation can be left distributive without being right distributive with respect to another operation.

The text discusses the concept of distributive properties in algebra but extends beyond traditional operations like addition and multiplication to more abstract binary operations. It introduces two types of distribution: left distributive and right distributive.

1. **Left Distributive Property**: An operation \( * \) is left distributive over another operation \( + \) if for all elements \( A, B, C \), the equation \( A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C) \) holds true. This means that distributing \( A \) over the addition of \( B \) and \( C \) results in two separate operations added together.

2. **Right Distributive Property**: An operation \( * \) is right distributive over another operation \( + \) if for all elements \( A, B, C \), the equation \( (B + C) * A = (B * A) + (C * A) \) holds true. This means distributing \( A \) on the right of an addition yields two separate operations added together.

The text then provides a specific example using integers:
- The binary operation defined as addition (\(+\)) is compared with another custom operation where for elements \( x \) and \( y \), \( x \ast y = x^2 \cdot y \).

**Example Analysis**:
- **Left Distributive**: Checking if the operation \( \ast \) (defined as \( x^2 \cdot y \)) is left distributive over addition:
  - For elements \( a, b, c \), we need to verify \( a \ast (b + c) = (a \ast b) + (a \ast c) \).
  - Calculation: \( a \ast (b+c) = a^2(b+c) = a^2b + a^2c \).
  - And separately, \( (a \ast b) + (a \ast c) = a^2b + a^2c \).
  - Since both expressions are equal, the operation is left distributive.

- **Right Distributive**: Checking if the operation \( \ast \) is right distributive over addition:
  - For elements \( b, c, a \), we need to verify \( (b+c) \ast a = (b \ast a) + (c \ast a) \).
  - Calculation: \( (b+c) \ast a = (b+c)^2 \cdot a = (b^2 + 2bc + c^2)a = ab^2 + 2abc + ac^2 \).
  - And separately, \( (b \ast a) + (c \ast a) = b^2a + c^2a \).
  - These expressions are not equal, so the operation is not right distributive.

In summary, in this example, the custom binary operation defined as \( x^2 \cdot y \) is left distributive but not right distributive over addition.
