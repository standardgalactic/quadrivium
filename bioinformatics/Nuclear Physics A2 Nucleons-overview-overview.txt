The text explores various problems in atomic physics and nuclear properties through theoretical explanations and practical calculations:

1. **Area Ratio of Bismuth and Hydrogen Nuclei**: The calculation focuses on finding the ratio of surface areas between bismuth nuclei (atomic mass number 209) and hydrogen nuclei (atomic mass number 1). Using the formula for the area of a sphere (\(4 \pi r^2\)) and assuming \(r = 1.2 \times A^{1/3}\) femtometers, the area ratio is approximately 35.2.

2. **Identifying an Unknown Nucleus**: Given that the radius of an unknown nucleus is 1.10 times that of tritium (atomic mass number 3), calculations using the nuclear radius formula suggest this nucleus has an atomic mass number of 4, identifying it as helium-4.

3. **Neutron Star Hypothetical**: The problem estimates how many neutrons could fit inside a tennis ball if packed with nuclear density. By calculating the volume ratio between a neutron and a tennis ball, approximately \(1.9 \times 10^{40}\) neutrons can be contained within it.

4. **Gravitational Acceleration from a Neutron-Dense Tennis Ball**: If this hypothetical tennis ball is treated as an object with high density due to packed neutrons, the gravitational acceleration experienced by another object placed 2 meters away is calculated using Newton's law of gravitation. The resulting acceleration is about \(527 \text{ m/s}^2\), approximately 54 times Earth's gravity (\(g\)).

The text blends theoretical concepts with practical calculations to illustrate nuclear physics scenarios.
