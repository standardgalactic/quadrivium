The text discusses damped harmonic motion, which occurs when a retarding force proportional to velocity is introduced into the system. This damping force, often due to air resistance or friction within the spring mechanism, opposes the direction of velocity and affects how the spring moves up and down.

To model this mathematically, an equation of motion is formulated as a second-order differential equation:

\[ x'' + 2\lambda x' + \omega^2 x = 0 \]

Here, \( \beta/m \) is denoted by \( 2\lambda \), where \( \beta \) is the damping coefficient and \( m \) is mass. Meanwhile, \( k/m \) is represented as \( \omega^2 \).

The equation can lead to three scenarios based on the nature of its roots:

1. **Overdamped**: When the roots are real and distinct (\(\lambda^2 > \omega^2\)), resulting in two negative exponential terms. The solution takes the form:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 e^{(m_1 t)} + c_2 e^{(m_2 t)}
   \]
   where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are distinct real roots.

2. **Critically Damped**: When the roots are real and equal (\(\lambda^2 = \omega^2\)), resulting in a repeated root. The solution becomes:
   \[
   x(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t) e^{-\lambda t}
   \]

3. **Underdamped**: When the roots are complex conjugates (\(\lambda^2 < \omega^2\)), indicating oscillatory motion with exponential decay. The solution is expressed as:
   \[
   x(t) = e^{-\lambda t} (c_1 \cos(\beta t) + c_2 \sin(\beta t))
   \]
   where \( \beta = \sqrt{\omega^2 - \lambda^2} \).

These scenarios describe how the system behaves under different damping conditions, affecting whether it oscillates and how quickly it returns to equilibrium.
