The text discusses damped harmonic motion, which occurs when a retarding force proportional to velocity is introduced into the system. This damping force, often due to air resistance or friction within the spring mechanism, opposes the direction of velocity and affects how the spring moves up and down.

To model this mathematically, an equation of motion is formulated as a second-order differential equation:

\[ x'' + 2\lambda x' + \omega^2 x = 0 \]

Here, \( \beta/m \) is denoted by \( 2\lambda \), where \( \beta \) is the damping coefficient and \( m \) is mass. Meanwhile, \( k/m \) is represented as \( \omega^2 \).

The equation can lead to three scenarios based on the nature of its roots:

1. **Overdamped**: When the roots are real and distinct (\(\lambda^2 > \omega^2\)), resulting in two negative exponential terms. The solution takes the form:
   \[
   x(t) = c_1 e^{(m_1 t)} + c_2 e^{(m_2 t)}
   \]
   where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are distinct real roots.

2. **Critically Damped**: When the roots are real and equal (\(\lambda^2 = \omega^2\)), resulting in a repeated root. The solution becomes:
   \[
   x(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t) e^{-\lambda t}
   \]

3. **Underdamped**: When the roots are complex conjugates (\(\lambda^2 < \omega^2\)), indicating oscillatory motion with exponential decay. The solution is expressed as:
   \[
   x(t) = e^{-\lambda t} (c_1 \cos(\beta t) + c_2 \sin(\beta t))
   \]
   where \( \beta = \sqrt{\omega^2 - \lambda^2} \).

These scenarios describe how the system behaves under different damping conditions, affecting whether it oscillates and how quickly it returns to equilibrium.

The text discusses damped motion by introducing a retarding force proportional to velocity, which affects the movement of a spring oscillating up and down. This damping is due to forces such as air resistance or internal friction within the spring.

To model this mathematically, a second-order differential equation is used:

\[ x'' + 2\lambda x' + \omega^2 x = 0 \]

Here:
- \( \lambda = \frac{\beta}{m} \) represents the damping constant per unit mass.
- \( \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \) represents the natural frequency squared, with \( k \) being the spring constant.

The auxiliary equation derived from this differential equation is:

\[ m^2 - 2\lambda m + \omega^2 = 0 \]

Solutions to this equation determine the system's behavior:
1. **Overdamped**: If the roots are real and distinct (\(\lambda^2 > \omega^2\)), the motion decays exponentially without oscillating.
   - Solution: \( x(t) = c_1 e^{m_1 t} + c_2 e^{m_2 t} \)
   - Where \( m_1, m_2 \) are negative.

2. **Critically Damped**: If the roots are real and equal (\(\lambda^2 = \omega^2\)), the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating.
   - Solution: \( x(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t)e^{-\lambda t} \)

3. **Underdamped**: If the roots are complex conjugates (\(\lambda^2 < \omega^2\)), the system oscillates with a gradually decreasing amplitude.
   - Solution: \( x(t) = e^{-\lambda t}(c_1 \cos(\beta t) + c_2 \sin(\beta t)) \)
   - Where \(\beta = \sqrt{\omega^2 - \lambda^2}\).

This analysis helps in understanding how damping affects oscillatory systems, influencing their return to equilibrium.
