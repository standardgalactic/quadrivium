The lecture discusses solving non-homogeneous linear systems of differential equations. Traditionally, homogeneous systems have the form \( A \times X = X' \), where there is no external input or forcing function (\( f(t) \)). To solve non-homogeneous systems, an additional method must be employed since standard techniques for single differential equations don't always apply to linear systems.

The lecture introduces two methods: undetermined coefficients and the use of linear algebra. The method of undetermined coefficients is described as applicable but not ideal due to potential complications when extending from single equations to systems. This technique involves finding a particular solution \( X_p \) that fits the non-homogeneous system, alongside solving for the homogeneous part.

The lecture provides an example where the forcing function \( f(t) = [-8, 3]^T \). A particular solution is sought in the form of constants \( [a_1, b_1]^T \), leading to a set of algebraic equations derived by substituting these into the original differential equation. Using linear algebra techniques such as row reduction, the values for \( a_1 \) and \( b_1 \) are found (14 and 11 respectively).

Finally, the complete solution combines this particular solution with the homogeneous solution, resulting in the general solution for the system. The process involves substituting the derived particular solution back into the original equation to verify consistency, ultimately yielding a set of solutions that can be expressed as \( X = X_c + X_p \), where \( X_c \) is the complementary (homogeneous) solution and \( X_p \) is the particular solution.
