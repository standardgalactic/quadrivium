Now, let's move on to Young's double-slip experiment.
So, what we have here, you'll see the schematic drawings in your textbook.
We have a light source, then we have a first barrier
and that barrier is a tiny little slip through which
there's electromagnetic waves and light can go. We usually use
monochromatic light.
We'll see later that if you use white light, what the effect is going to be.
Then there's the second slits. They are a distance D apart,
those two slits, and on the opposite side there's a board and you're going to see
this bright fringe and then you're going to see
darker bands and another bright fringe, a dark band, another bright fringe,
et cetera, et cetera, symmetrically on both sides as there is
interference, constructive interference, and destructive interference
certain distances away from the middle.
Why are there three slits? Why do you need this slit? It's just because
we need a point source of light.
If we didn't have this,
usually your point source of light here
is quite large. To make it small
is very difficult.
And you might then have
this light strike
these different,
these two slits at different angles
and then you're going to have all sorts of chaos
on the right hand side. So this is just
to create a point source.
Every point source obeys then
the wavelength principle. In other words,
there is this concentric, as if that
is a specific source, and there's this concentric
wave fronts that go out,
wave fronts that go out from there.
So let's look at the set. I think most of us
will know that there's a bright spot
in the middle. Why does that happen?
So let's view a young,
this is a double slit experiment from the top.
We're just viewing these two slits,
distance d apart.
Now later on we'll see
that it's the wavelength
and the size of these gaps
and then the distance between them.
there's got to be a certain relationship
between them for this sort of thing to work.
But right at the center line
you'll get that L2 and L1
and these are the two lines
will be equal to each other.
So L2 minus L1 is going to be zero.
In other words, we'll get constructive
interference at that point.
If we look at points further away
where this is
the center line
and we
go up
enough distance away
so that if I draw this
perpendicular line here
it makes this a triangle
that's not perpendicular
shouldn't be perpendicular
I make these two angles
exactly the same. If these two angles
are the same then
these two L1 equals
L2
and again
and again
well not L2
to say L2
minus Lambda.
This whole thing is L2
but just the section.
Okay, if these two are then the same
that means
I've chosen this box so
that this is exactly Lambda.
So L2 minus L1
is the same. So L2
or the section of L2 minus L1
is going to equal zero.
Let me put it this way
Let me put it this way.
L2 minus Lambda.
So I'm only talking about this section
minus L1 equals zero.
So in other words, that'll be constructive interference there
and I'm adding to L2
exactly one wavelength.
I've chosen it so that this
and I have these two angles the same
that this is exactly Lambda.
That means I'm still going to get constructive interference there.
If I chose it so
that this would be half a Lambda
or 3 over 2
or 5 over 2
or 7 over 2 Lambda.
This little section.
Then the difference between the whole L2 and L1
is going to be
in the order of M plus a half.
Plus a half Lambda.
In other words, you need to have
total
destructive interference
in that way.
So have these schematics in your mind
move on to how we can calculate
what these distances are going to be
to successive
lighter bands and darker bands
light fringe and a darker fringe
whatever the textbook calls it.
This first one that's light will be zero.
The first one there will be
first order
light fringe
and then the second order
the second order light fringe etc.
This might have been the third order
third order
bright fringe.
Remember these schematics
we'll move on to how to calculate
what these distances
between these should be.
Okay.
Let's see if we can then
determine this distance that
that
that these
bright fringes are
apart from each other or indeed
that in the darker ones where there's
destructive interference.
So what I've drawn here again is that
there are two slits which
make this source 1 and source 2
and they are distance d apart.
Now what I've done here is
if this distance from
the source to the scheme
is a lot more
than this distance d or indeed
the wavelength
let me just answer it at all.
Okay. Apologies for that.
What I'm saying is that this distance
is a lot more
then in essence we can see
these two lines as being parallel to each other
and then obviously a long distance
further away they do converge
because we do need that constructive
or destructive interference or
somewhere in between.
It's not a black line and a white line
and it goes over to shades of grey
between the white and black.
Okay. As we get intermediate
type of interference.
But I'm doing this so that these
two lines are in essence parallel
which means the angle that they
make with a normal layer of theta
and if I draw a line here
that means this is perpendicular.
This now becomes 90 degrees.
If that's 90 degrees and this angle
is then also 90 degrees
because these two lines are parallel.
So if this is 90 degrees
and that is 90 degrees and they have
this common angle and that's theta,
that is theta as well.
And this distance here now will
denote as delta L inasmuch as it is
the whole of length 2
minus length 1
is going to be this small bit.
Okay. Which I'll denote as delta L.
And if L2 minus L1
is M times the wavelength
where M is 0 or any positive integer
for constructive or destructive interference.
That means the sine of theta equals
opposite which is now this delta L
divided by the hypotenuse.
This is 90 degree angle.
So this is the hypotenuse which is D.
So we're going to have that the sine of theta
is going to equal M times lambda divided by D.
D is the distance between these two.
And that will be for constructive,
the light bands.
If M is 0, that means we're going to
talk about the one that's straight through.
That's the zeroth band.
And then with M equals 1,
that would be the first order band,
second order band, etc.
And then for the darker bands,
total destruction,
we're going to have destructive interference.
We're going to have M plus a half
lambda divided by
lambda divided by D.
In other words, if we just look at this,
think about that angle
that this makes.
And if you know that angle,
and if you know the distance,
we're going to use trigonometry to work out
now what this is going to be
as far as the tangent of this angle
that you know,
is this which you want to find out.
That distance divided by this distance which you know.
But anyway, we're going to get a couple of my grand letters
then going to be the arcsine
of
M lambda over D.
Okay.
Now remember that the arcsine is only defined
from negative 1
to 1.
It's not defined outside
of that.
In other words,
we've got to look at situations
where this
where this
is little larger than
or is not outside
negative 1 and 1.
That means this lambda
has got to be appreciably smaller
than D
as much as we also have to figure
a whole integer in there.
So this numerator has to be smaller
than the denominator
and appreciably so.
So you can't have these massive wavelengths
larger than
the distance D here.
And obviously then you'll get
an error in your calculator.
for arcsine to be larger
for arcsine to be larger than 1.
So just watch out for that
problem
when you do exercises
and you're looking for solutions
to your homework.
Just look at that.
Okay, what's going to happen if we use
white light as opposed to monochromatic light?
What you're going to see
in most of your textbooks will probably show
that you can get the central light band
and then you're going to get
the different colors
going symmetrically out
and what you're actually going to get
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
you're going to get this rainbow effect
in reverse order
which is you're going to get
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
and then on this side you're going to get
violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.
So it repeats. Why is that so?
Well, it's because of this equation.
In as much as the wavelength
of red light is 616 nanometers
much longer so for instance
than green.
If this denominator is larger
that makes this angle larger
so the red from this
this is our double slip
the red is going to deflect a lot more
this angle for red is going to be more
than the angle for violet.
Okay, because the numerator
is larger.
Okay, in the next video
we'll start looking at some problems.
