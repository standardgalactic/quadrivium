Jean is a surgeon specializing in acute care conditions requiring urgent surgical attention. He explains gallstones, which are stones forming in the gallbladder from bile, and discusses their types: cholesterol stones (75% of cases), black pigment stones (25%), and brown pigment stones (5%). Gallstones affect about 9% of women and 6% of men globally.

Risk factors for developing gallstones include age (higher risk in those over 50), gender (more common in women), genetics, pregnancy, certain medical conditions like diabetes (especially in women), obesity, rapid weight loss, and hormone replacement therapy. However, there's no direct correlation between high cholesterol levels and gallstones.

Preventive measures include taking vitamin C, consuming polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats (found in nuts), drinking coffee, adopting a vegan diet with plant protein, and engaging in regular physical activity. Jean concludes by encouraging viewers to subscribe for more helpful videos.
