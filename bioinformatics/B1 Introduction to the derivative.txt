So in this section we're just going to look at the derivative. Just a few short words on the topic
just to reiterate some of the knowledge that you might already have. Here we represent
a function with a graph. It is a graph of a straight line. In other words we are looking
at y equals mx plus c and you will remember that that m stands for the slope and there we have the
slope y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 or the change in y over the change in x also known as the rise over
the run. So there we have a change in x and there we have a change in y. What we are saying is at the
moment we are at this position 0,0 representing x sub 1 and y sub 1 and we move along the line say in
time or along the x-axis we get to this point y sub 2 x sub 2 y sub 2 which is 2 comma 2. So what we are
saying is that for a change in the x-axis of 2 what will be the change in the y-axis? That's what we're
saying the change in y divided by the change in x that means the change in y per unit change of x
per unit change of x and that gives us the slope of this line and if you play in the Desmos calculator
you'll note that as the slope as this m value gets larger obviously the slope goes up and when it's
straight up there you get to a zero change here which is of course impossible can't divide by zero so it
just approaches infinity this slope but as we go down and we get a horizontal line that is going to be a
slope of zero in as much as the change in y the numerator will be zero now it's an important equation
to remember i think most most will will note but it is the concept that is important i might start to
plot and i think a couple of videos down the line let's have a quick look indeed we we plot we plot these
values that we get from an experiment here we have concentration and here we have monomers per second
and we plot them we do an experiment where we put various concentrations in our solution and we get a
certain velocity of growth and we plot if our concentration was that this is what we get if our
concentrations open for this is what we get as far as velocity is concerned and so on and so on
and when we then draw it we can see well this almost makes a straight line and we can draw a
straight line there we can now say the slope of this line gives us predictive powers and as much we can
say well because we know the slope we know if we go up to a concentration of two comma zero we can work out
what the velocity is going to be in the growth of this well this is the growth of a filament but there's
power in knowing what this slope is so it has actual value for us and that's why it's important to know
how to calculate it
