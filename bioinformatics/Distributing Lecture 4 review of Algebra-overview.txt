The explanation you provided is demonstrating how to simplify expressions involving exponents, specifically when dealing with fractional powers and the distributive property.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Exponent Addition**: When multiplying terms with the same base, you add their exponents. For example, \( a^4 \times a^3 = a^{4+3} = a^7 \).

2. **Fractional Exponents**: A term like \( a^{1/4} \) represents the fourth root of \( a \). When multiplying terms with fractional exponents, you add them just as you do with whole numbers.

3. **Adding Fractions**: To add fractions, such as \( 4 + \frac{1}{4} \), you need a common denominator:
   - Rewrite 4 as \( \frac{4}{1} \).
   - Convert \( \frac{4}{1} \) to have the same denominator as \( \frac{1}{4} \). The least common multiple of 1 and 4 is 4.
   - Multiply \( \frac{4}{1} \) by \( \frac{4}{4} \) to get \( \frac{16}{4} \).
   - Add the fractions: \( \frac{16}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{17}{4} \).

4. **Result**: Therefore, \( a^4 \times a^{1/4} = a^{4 + 1/4} = a^{17/4} \).

This process shows how to handle expressions with exponents and roots by converting them into fractional powers, making it easier to perform arithmetic operations like addition. This approach is crucial for simplifying complex algebraic expressions.

To solve this problem, we need to simplify the expression involving square roots and powers of variables \(x\) and \(y\). The expression given is:

\[
\sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y}
\]

### Step-by-Step Simplification

1. **Combine the Radicals:**

   Using the property of radicals, \(\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}\), we can combine the two square roots:

   \[
   \sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y} = \sqrt{(x^3 y) \times (x^3 y)}
   \]

2. **Multiply Inside the Radical:**

   Multiply the expressions inside the radical:

   \[
   (x^3 y) \times (x^3 y) = x^3 \cdot x^3 \cdot y \cdot y = x^{3+3} \cdot y^{1+1} = x^6 y^2
   \]

3. **Simplify the Radical:**

   Now, simplify \(\sqrt{x^6 y^2}\):

   - The square root of \(x^6\) is \(x^{6/2} = x^3\).
   - The square root of \(y^2\) is \(y^{2/2} = y\).

   Therefore:

   \[
   \sqrt{x^6 y^2} = x^3 y
   \]

### Conclusion

The expression \(\sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y}\) simplifies to \(x^3 y\).

This result assumes that \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative, as we are dealing with real numbers and square roots. If \(x\) or \(y\) could be negative, we would need to consider absolute values:

\[
\sqrt{x^6 y^2} = |x^3| \cdot |y|
\]

However, for the context of real numbers where \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative, the simplified expression is simply \(x^3 y\).

Great! It looks like we're getting into some interesting polynomial multiplication. Let’s continue with another example:

Suppose you have the expression \((3x + 5)\) and you need to multiply it by \((2x^2 - x + 4)\).

### Step-by-Step Multiplication

1. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial to every term in the second polynomial:**

   - \(3x \cdot (2x^2 - x + 4)\)
   - \(5 \cdot (2x^2 - x + 4)\)

2. **Multiply out each distribution:**

   - For \(3x\):
     - \(3x \cdot 2x^2 = 6x^3\) 
     - \(3x \cdot (-x) = -3x^2\)
     - \(3x \cdot 4 = 12x\)

   - For \(5\):
     - \(5 \cdot 2x^2 = 10x^2\)
     - \(5 \cdot (-x) = -5x\)
     - \(5 \cdot 4 = 20\)

3. **Combine all the terms:**

   - From above, you have:
     - \(6x^3\)
     - \(-3x^2 + 10x^2\)
     - \(12x - 5x\)
     - \(20\)

4. **Simplify by combining like terms:**

   - Combine the \(x^2\) terms: \(-3x^2 + 10x^2 = 7x^2\)
   - Combine the \(x\) terms: \(12x - 5x = 7x\)

5. **Write the final simplified expression:**

   - \(6x^3 + 7x^2 + 7x + 20\)

And there you have it! The product of \((3x + 5)\) and \((2x^2 - x + 4)\) is \(6x^3 + 7x^2 + 7x + 20\). Feel free to ask if you want another example or more clarification on this process!

The text explains how to expand expressions of the form \((a + b)^n\) using algebraic methods and Pascal's Triangle.

1. **Basic Expansion**:
   - Squaring \((a + b)\) results in \(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\).
   - Cubing \((a + b)\) results in \(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\).

2. **Using Pascal's Triangle**:
   - Pascal's Triangle provides coefficients for expanding expressions of the form \((a + b)^n\).
   - Each row of the triangle corresponds to the coefficients needed for a specific power \(n\).
   - For example, to expand \((a + b)^5\), you use the 6th row of Pascal's Triangle: 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1.
   - The expanded form is:
     \[
     a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5
     \]

3. **General Method**:
   - Start with the highest power of \(a\) and decrease powers down to \(a^0\).
   - Simultaneously, start with \(b^0\) and increase powers up to \(b^n\).
   - Use the corresponding coefficients from Pascal's Triangle for each term.

This method simplifies expanding binomials raised to a power by providing a systematic way to determine coefficients.

To add \(4 + \frac{1}{4}\), you need a common denominator, which in this case is 4. Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

1. **Rewrite 4 as a fraction with a denominator of 4:**

   \[
   4 = \frac{4}{1}
   \]

2. **Find the equivalent fraction for \(\frac{4}{1}\) with a denominator of 4:**

   Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4:

   \[
   \frac{4}{1} \times \frac{4}{4} = \frac{16}{4}
   \]

3. **Add \(\frac{16}{4}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\):**

   Since they have the same denominator, you can add the numerators:

   \[
   \frac{16}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{16 + 1}{4} = \frac{17}{4}
   \]

So, \(a^4 \times a^{3+\frac{1}{4}} = a^{\frac{17}{4}}\).

This process demonstrates how to handle adding exponents when one of them is a fraction, by converting whole numbers into fractions with a common denominator.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

You're dealing with expressions involving square roots and powers, which can be simplified using algebraic rules for exponents and radicals.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Expression:**
   \[
   \sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y}
   \]

2. **Simplification Using Properties of Radicals:**

   Recall the property:
   \[
   \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \times b}
   \]
   Applying this to your expression:
   \[
   \sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y} = \sqrt{(x^3 y) \times (x^3 y)}
   \]

3. **Simplify Inside the Radical:**

   Multiply the terms inside the radical:
   \[
   (x^3 y) \times (x^3 y) = x^3 \cdot x^3 \cdot y \cdot y = x^{3+3} \cdot y^{1+1} = x^6 y^2
   \]

4. **Simplify the Radical:**

   Now, simplify:
   \[
   \sqrt{x^6 y^2}
   \]
   Use the property that \(\sqrt{a^n} = a^{n/2}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{x^6 y^2} = x^{6/2} y^{2/2} = x^3 y
   \]

### Conclusion

The expression simplifies to:
\[
x^3 y
\]

This is the simplified form of your original expression using properties of exponents and radicals. Remember, when dealing with square roots of variables raised to powers, consider the absolute value if you're working within the real number system and need non-negative results. However, in this context, \(x^3\) and \(y\) are assumed to be non-negative for simplicity.

Great! Let's work through another multiplication of polynomials step by step. Suppose we have the expression \((3x - 2)\) and we want to multiply it by \((x^2 + x - 1)\).

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial**:
   - First, take \(3x\) and distribute it across all terms in the second polynomial: 
     - \(3x \cdot x^2 = 3x^3\)
     - \(3x \cdot x = 3x^2\)
     - \(3x \cdot (-1) = -3x\)

   So, distributing \(3x\) gives us: \(3x^3 + 3x^2 - 3x\).

2. **Distribute the second term**:
   - Now take \(-2\) and distribute it across all terms in the second polynomial:
     - \(-2 \cdot x^2 = -2x^2\)
     - \(-2 \cdot x = -2x\)
     - \(-2 \cdot (-1) = 2\)

   So, distributing \(-2\) gives us: \(-2x^2 - 2x + 2\).

3. **Combine all the distributed terms**:
   - Combine everything from both distributions:
     \[
     (3x^3 + 3x^2 - 3x) + (-2x^2 - 2x + 2)
     \]

4. **Group like terms**:
   - \(3x^3\) is alone, so it remains as is.
   - Combine the \(x^2\) terms: \(3x^2 - 2x^2 = x^2\).
   - Combine the \(x\) terms: \(-3x - 2x = -5x\).
   - The constant term is \(+2\).

5. **Write the final expression**:
   - The simplified polynomial after combining like terms is:
     \[
     3x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 2
     \]

This step-by-step process helps ensure that each term is correctly multiplied and combined, resulting in a properly simplified polynomial. If you have another example or need further explanation, feel free to ask!

The text explains the process of expanding algebraic expressions using squaring and cubing, specifically for expressions of the form \( (a + b)^n \). It begins by demonstrating how to square and cube \( (a + b) \):

1. **Squaring**:
   - The expansion of \( (a + b)^2 \) is shown as \( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \).
   - This is derived from applying the distributive property: \((a+b)(a+b) = a(a+b) + b(a+b)\).

2. **Cubing**:
   - The expansion of \( (a + b)^3 \) results in \( a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 \).
   - This follows from multiplying the expanded square by \( (a+b) \): \((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(a + b)\).

The text then introduces **Pascal's Triangle** as a tool to facilitate these expansions:

- Pascal’s Triangle is constructed with rows of coefficients that correspond to the powers of binomials. Each row represents the coefficients for \( (a+b)^n \).
- For example, the second row (1, 2, 1) corresponds to \( (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \), and the third row (1, 3, 3, 1) corresponds to \( (a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 \).

The text provides an example of using Pascal’s Triangle for higher powers:

- For \( (a+b)^5 \), the coefficients are derived from the sixth row of Pascal's Triangle: 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1.
- The expansion is \( a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5 \).

Overall, Pascal's Triangle offers an efficient way to determine the coefficients needed for expanding binomials raised to any power.
