The explanation you provided is demonstrating how to simplify expressions involving exponents, specifically when dealing with fractional powers and the distributive property.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Exponent Addition**: When multiplying terms with the same base, you add their exponents. For example, \( a^4 \times a^3 = a^{4+3} = a^7 \).

2. **Fractional Exponents**: A term like \( a^{1/4} \) represents the fourth root of \( a \). When multiplying terms with fractional exponents, you add them just as you do with whole numbers.

3. **Adding Fractions**: To add fractions, such as \( 4 + \frac{1}{4} \), you need a common denominator:
   - Rewrite 4 as \( \frac{4}{1} \).
   - Convert \( \frac{4}{1} \) to have the same denominator as \( \frac{1}{4} \). The least common multiple of 1 and 4 is 4.
   - Multiply \( \frac{4}{1} \) by \( \frac{4}{4} \) to get \( \frac{16}{4} \).
   - Add the fractions: \( \frac{16}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{17}{4} \).

4. **Result**: Therefore, \( a^4 \times a^{1/4} = a^{4 + 1/4} = a^{17/4} \).

This process shows how to handle expressions with exponents and roots by converting them into fractional powers, making it easier to perform arithmetic operations like addition. This approach is crucial for simplifying complex algebraic expressions.

To solve this problem, we need to simplify the expression involving square roots and powers of variables \(x\) and \(y\). The expression given is:

\[
\sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y}
\]

### Step-by-Step Simplification

1. **Combine the Radicals:**

   Using the property of radicals, \(\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}\), we can combine the two square roots:

   \[
   \sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y} = \sqrt{(x^3 y) \times (x^3 y)}
   \]

2. **Multiply Inside the Radical:**

   Multiply the expressions inside the radical:

   \[
   (x^3 y) \times (x^3 y) = x^3 \cdot x^3 \cdot y \cdot y = x^{3+3} \cdot y^{1+1} = x^6 y^2
   \]

3. **Simplify the Radical:**

   Now, simplify \(\sqrt{x^6 y^2}\):

   - The square root of \(x^6\) is \(x^{6/2} = x^3\).
   - The square root of \(y^2\) is \(y^{2/2} = y\).

   Therefore:

   \[
   \sqrt{x^6 y^2} = x^3 y
   \]

### Conclusion

The expression \(\sqrt{x^3 y} \times \sqrt{x^3 y}\) simplifies to \(x^3 y\).

This result assumes that \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative, as we are dealing with real numbers and square roots. If \(x\) or \(y\) could be negative, we would need to consider absolute values:

\[
\sqrt{x^6 y^2} = |x^3| \cdot |y|
\]

However, for the context of real numbers where \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative, the simplified expression is simply \(x^3 y\).

Great! It looks like we're getting into some interesting polynomial multiplication. Letâ€™s continue with another example:

Suppose you have the expression \((3x + 5)\) and you need to multiply it by \((2x^2 - x + 4)\).

### Step-by-Step Multiplication

1. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial to every term in the second polynomial:**

   - \(3x \cdot (2x^2 - x + 4)\)
   - \(5 \cdot (2x^2 - x + 4)\)

2. **Multiply out each distribution:**

   - For \(3x\):
     - \(3x \cdot 2x^2 = 6x^3\) 
     - \(3x \cdot (-x) = -3x^2\)
     - \(3x \cdot 4 = 12x\)

   - For \(5\):
     - \(5 \cdot 2x^2 = 10x^2\)
     - \(5 \cdot (-x) = -5x\)
     - \(5 \cdot 4 = 20\)

3. **Combine all the terms:**

   - From above, you have:
     - \(6x^3\)
     - \(-3x^2 + 10x^2\)
     - \(12x - 5x\)
     - \(20\)

4. **Simplify by combining like terms:**

   - Combine the \(x^2\) terms: \(-3x^2 + 10x^2 = 7x^2\)
   - Combine the \(x\) terms: \(12x - 5x = 7x\)

5. **Write the final simplified expression:**

   - \(6x^3 + 7x^2 + 7x + 20\)

And there you have it! The product of \((3x + 5)\) and \((2x^2 - x + 4)\) is \(6x^3 + 7x^2 + 7x + 20\). Feel free to ask if you want another example or more clarification on this process!

The text explains how to expand expressions of the form \((a + b)^n\) using algebraic methods and Pascal's Triangle.

1. **Basic Expansion**:
   - Squaring \((a + b)\) results in \(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\).
   - Cubing \((a + b)\) results in \(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\).

2. **Using Pascal's Triangle**:
   - Pascal's Triangle provides coefficients for expanding expressions of the form \((a + b)^n\).
   - Each row of the triangle corresponds to the coefficients needed for a specific power \(n\).
   - For example, to expand \((a + b)^5\), you use the 6th row of Pascal's Triangle: 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1.
   - The expanded form is:
     \[
     a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5
     \]

3. **General Method**:
   - Start with the highest power of \(a\) and decrease powers down to \(a^0\).
   - Simultaneously, start with \(b^0\) and increase powers up to \(b^n\).
   - Use the corresponding coefficients from Pascal's Triangle for each term.

This method simplifies expanding binomials raised to a power by providing a systematic way to determine coefficients.
