The text describes solving problems involving logistic growth models and separable first-order differential equations. Hereâ€™s an overview:

1. **Logistic Growth Model:**
   - The model is defined with a maximum sustainable population (\(m = 1000\)) and growth rate (\(k = 0.007\)).
   - Using the logistic equation, \( y(t) = \frac{m}{1 + ae^{-kmt}} \), it finds an expression for the population at any time \( t \).
   - Given initial conditions (\(y(0) = 350\)), the constant \(a\) is solved as \(\frac{35}{65}\).
   - The resulting equation is: 
     \[
     y(t) = \frac{1000 \times \frac{35}{65}}{1 + \frac{35}{65}e^{-7t}}
     \]

2. **Separable Differential Equations:**
   - Various methods are used to solve different types of separable equations:
     - The first involves simplifying expressions using exponentials and logarithms.
     - The second rewrites the equation in Leibniz notation, integrating both sides to relate \(y\) and \(x^3\).
     - In another problem, substitution (\(u = 1 + x^3\)) simplifies integration, resulting in a natural log function.

3. **Integration by Parts:**
   - The text demonstrates solving integrals using the formula \(\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du\).
   - For an integral involving \(y\) and \(e^{-y}\), it chooses \(u = y\) and \(dv = e^{-y} \, dy\), resulting in:
     \[
     -\frac{y}{e^y} + \frac{1}{e^y} + C_1
     \]
   - Similarly, for an integral with \(2x\) and \(e^{-x}\):
     \[
     -\frac{2x}{e^x} - \frac{2}{e^x} + C_2
     \]
   - Equating both sides gives a relationship between \(x\) and \(y\).

4. **Manipulating Expressions:**
   - The text discusses achieving simplification by finding common denominators and expressing numerators in terms of constants, leading to the general solution for differential equations.
   - Emphasis is placed on refining integration techniques, particularly integration by parts.

Overall, these sections provide a comprehensive guide to solving logistic growth models and various types of first-order differential equations using separation of variables, substitution, and integration methods.
