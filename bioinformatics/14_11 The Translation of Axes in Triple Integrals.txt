In the next few videos we're going to look at the translation of axes in the
triple integral. Now as with translation in the double integral, we translate
the axes by following a few steps. You can already see in the green equation at
the bottom what we are going to aim for. So we're going to construct again a
vector with the translation equations and we'll call that vector t, some
textbooks call it vector s, and in this instance we've just got it in these three
variables u, v, and w. We're going to recalculate the original function, the f of
the vector x, in other words the f of x, y, and z, but in our new vector, so it'll be
the vector and the function f in the vector t of u, v, and w. We're also going
to calculate the determinant of the Jacobean matrix of our vector, and
remember those would be absolute values, and we're going to then integrate over
the new axes depending on the region that we choose. In this instance we've called
it du, dv, and dw. We're going to look at cylindrical axes and we're also going to
have a look at spherical axes.
