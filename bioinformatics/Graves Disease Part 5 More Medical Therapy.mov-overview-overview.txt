The text explores various medical treatments for Graves' disease, focusing on lithium, cholestyramine, and rituximab. Lithium is used in specific cases such as when thionamides are discontinued or during amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis; it impacts hormone synthesis and release with a usual dose of 300 mg per day, requiring careful monitoring to prevent toxicity. Cholestyramine binds thyroid hormones in the gut, disrupting their enterohepatic circulation and effectively managing thyrotoxicosis. Rituximab targets CD20 on pre-B cells as an immunomodulatory approach, showing potential for Graves' disease by modulating the immune system; however, its efficacy and safety are still unproven. Other experimental drugs are also under investigation, with future discussions expected to delve deeper into these therapiesâ€™ outcomes. The subsequent video will address radioactive iodine therapy as another treatment option for Graves' disease.
