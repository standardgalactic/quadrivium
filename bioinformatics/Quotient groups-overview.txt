The passage discusses the concept of quotient groups in abstract algebra, specifically how one can construct new groups from an existing group by partitioning it into cosets. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Quotient Group Formation**: The text describes forming a quotient group \( G/N \) where \( N \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \). The elements of this quotient group are the cosets of \( N \) in \( G \).

2. **Cosets as Elements**: Each element of the quotient group is represented by a coset, which can be either a left or right coset due to \( N \) being normal.

3. **Binary Operation on Cosets**: The passage explains defining a binary operation on these cosets. If you take two arbitrary cosets and perform the group's binary operation (composition), the result is another coset in the quotient group.

4. **Associativity and Normality**: Using associativity of the original group \( G \) and the normalThe text describes how to form a quotient group from an original group \( G \) by using a normal subgroup \( N \). The steps include:

1. **Coset Formation**: Elements of the quotient group are cosets of the form \( gN = \{ gn \mid n \in N \} \), where each coset is considered as a single element in the new group.

2. **Binary Operation on Cosets**: Define a binary operation between these cosets, denoted by \( (aN) \cdot (bN) = (ab)N \). This uses the group operation from the original group \( G \).

3. **Well-Definedness**: Prove that this operation is well-defined. For any representatives \( a, b, a', b' \) such that \( aN = a'N \) and \( bN = b'N \), it must be shown that \( (ab)N = (a'b')N \). This relies on the normality of \( N \).

4. **Group Axioms**: Verify the group axioms for these cosets:
   - **Associativity**: Inherited from \( G \).
   - **Identity Element**: The identity is \( eN \), where \( e \) is the identity in \( G \).
   - **Inverses**: For each \( aN \), the inverse is \( (a^{-1})N \).

The quotient group, denoted as \( G/N \), consists of these cosets with the defined operation.

The text outlines an argument demonstrating that a particular set forms a group under a defined binary operation. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Closure**: The author asserts closure by definition since the binary operation between any two elements results in another element within the same set.

2. **Associativity**: Associativity is ensured by how the binary operation is defined, making it straightforward to show that grouping does not affect the outcome of operations among three elements.

3. **Identity Element**: The existence of an identity element \( E \) is established such that for any element \( A \), performing the binary operation with \( E \) yields \( A \).

4. **Inverse Elements**: Every element has an inverse within the set, meaning there exists another element which, when combined using the binary operation, results in the identity element.

Overall, by verifying these four group properties—closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses—the author concludes that the defined set with its binary operation indeed forms a group.
