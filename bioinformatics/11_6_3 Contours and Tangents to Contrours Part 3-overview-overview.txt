The text provides a detailed explanation for finding the equation of a tangent plane to the surface defined by \( z = \sin(xy) \) at the point \( (0, \pi, 0) \) in three-dimensional space. It outlines two methods:

1. **Direct Method**:
   - The gradient of the function \( f(x, y) = \sin(xy) \) is calculated as \( \nabla f = (y \cos(xy), x \cos(xy)) \).
   - At the point \( (0, \pi) \), the gradient evaluates to \( (\pi, 0) \).
   - Using this gradient and the given point, the equation of the tangent plane is determined to be \( z = \pi x \).

2. **Contour Method**:
   - A new function \( g(x, y, z) = \sin(xy) - z \) is introduced as a contour in higher dimensions.
   - The gradient of \( g \) is found: \( \nabla g = (y \cos(xy), x \cos(xy), -1) \).
   - At the point \( P(0, \pi, 0) \), this becomes \( (\pi, 0, -1) \).
   - By setting the dot product of the gradient vector with a vector in the tangent plane to zero, the equation for the tangent plane is again derived as \( z = \pi x \).

Additionally, the text explores finding the tangent line to the contour curve \( \sin(xy) = 0 \), which represents a level curve. It emphasizes:

- The use of the gradient at a specific point (\(\pi, 0\)) to determine perpendicularity to the tangent.
- Defining another vector in the plane using coordinates minus a reference point.
- Setting the dot product between the gradient and this vector to zero to derive the tangent line equation \( x = 0 \).

Overall, the text illustrates how gradients can be used to find tangents both in two-dimensional level curves and three-dimensional surfaces, extending traditional calculus into multivariable contexts.
