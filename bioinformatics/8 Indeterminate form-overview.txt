It looks like you're discussing how to handle indeterminate forms and limits, especially when working with expressions involving infinity, zero, or logarithms. Here are some key strategies for dealing with these problems:

1. **Identifying Indeterminate Forms**: Recognize common indeterminate forms such as \( \frac{0}{0} \), \( \infty - \infty \), \( 0 \times \infty \), \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \), \( 0^0 \), \( \infty^0 \), and \( 1^\infty \).

2. **L'Hôpital's Rule**: This rule is particularly useful for limits resulting in \( \frac{0}{0} \) or \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \). It states that if the limit of \( \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \) as \( x \to c \) results in an indeterminate form, then it can be evaluated by taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator: 
   \[
   \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
   \]
   provided the limit on the right exists.

3. **Algebraic Manipulation**: Simplify expressions by combining terms, factoring, expanding, or using common denominators to transform the expression into a determinate form.

4. **Multiplying by Conjugates or Other Expressions Equivalent to 1**: For expressions involving square roots or complex fractions, multiply by a conjugate or another expression that equals 1 (e.g., \( \frac{a+b}{a+b} \)) to simplify the limit.

5. **Rewriting Products and Quotients**: Convert products into quotients or vice versa. For example, rewrite \( f(x)g(x) \) as \( \frac{f(x)}{\frac{1}{g(x)}} \).

6. **Logarithmic Differentiation**: When dealing with products, powers, or roots, take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify differentiation.

7. **Series Expansion**: Use Taylor or Maclaurin series expansions for functions around a point to approximate and evaluate limits.

8. **Special Limits and Theorems**: Utilize known limits such as \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1 \) or the Squeeze Theorem when applicable.

9. **Exploring Multiple Approaches**: If one method leads to a dead end, backtrack and try another approach. Sometimes multiplying by a cleverly chosen expression can help transform an indeterminate form into a determinate one.

10. **Directional Limits**: Consider limits from different directions (e.g., left-hand limit \( x \to c^- \) or right-hand limit \( x \to c^+ \)) when the function behaves differently on either side of a point.

For complex problems, combining these strategies can be effective. Practice and familiarity with various techniques will enhance your ability to tackle challenging limits.

The text you've provided is a detailed explanation of how to tackle certain limit problems in calculus using logarithmic transformations. Let’s break down the key concepts:

### Key Concepts Explained

1. **Limit Problems**: You're dealing with limits that can't be solved by direct substitution or basic algebraic manipulation.

2. **Logarithmic Transformation**:
   - When faced with a difficult limit, especially those involving forms like \( \infty^0 \), \( 0^\infty \), or indeterminate forms like \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \) or \( \frac{0}{0} \), one useful technique is to take the natural logarithm.
   - Introduce a new variable \( y = f(x) \) where \( f(x) \) is the expression you're trying to find the limit of. Then consider \( \ln(y) \).

3. **Simplification**:
   - By taking the natural log, you can often simplify the problem into a form that allows for easier manipulation or application of L'Hôpital's Rule.
   - For example, if you have \( y = (x+1)^{2/x} \), then \( \ln(y) = \frac{2}{x} \ln(x+1) \).

4. **L'Hôpital's Rule**:
   - After transforming the problem using logarithms, you may encounter indeterminate forms like \( 0 \times \infty \) or \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \).
   - Rewrite these into a form suitable for L'Hôpital’s Rule (e.g., convert \( 0 \times \infty \) to \( \frac{0}{0} \) or \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \)).
   - Apply L’Hôpital’s Rule by differentiating the numerator and denominator until you reach a determinate form.

5. **Back-Transformation**:
   - Once you find the limit of \( \ln(y) \), exponentiate to get back to \( y \).
   - If \( \lim_{x \to c} \ln(y) = L \), then \( \lim_{x \to c} y = e^L \).

### Example Problems

1. **Problem**: \( \lim_{t \to \infty} (t+1)^{2/t} \)
   - Set \( y = (t+1)^{2/t} \).
   - Take the natural log: \( \ln(y) = \frac{2}{t} \ln(t+1) \).
   - Evaluate \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{2 \ln(t+1)}{t} \) using L'Hôpital’s Rule.
   - After simplification, you find the limit of \( \ln(y) \) is 0.
   - Therefore, \( \lim_{t \to \infty} y = e^0 = 1 \).

2. **Problem**: \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} x^{x^2} \)
   - Set \( y = x^{x^2} \).
   - Take the natural log: \( \ln(y) = x^2 \ln(x) \).
   - Evaluate \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} x^2 \ln(x) \) using transformations and L'Hôpital’s Rule.
   - After simplification, you find the limit of \( \ln(y) \) is 0.
   - Therefore, \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} y = e^0 = 1 \).

### Conclusion

These techniques are powerful for solving complex limits. They require a good understanding of logarithmic properties and L'Hôpital's Rule. Practice with various problems will enhance your ability to recognize when and how to apply these methods effectively.

To solve the limit problem where \( t \to 1^+ \) for an expression involving a term like \( (t-1)^{1/(t-1)} \), you can use logarithmic properties and L'Hôpital's Rule. Here's how:

### Problem:
Evaluate the limit:
\[
\lim_{t \to 1^+} (t-1)^{1/(t-1)}
\]

### Solution:

1. **Rewrite Using Logarithms:**

   Let \( y = (t-1)^{1/(t-1)} \). Then take the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \ln y = \frac{1}{t-1} \ln(t-1)
   \]

2. **Evaluate the Limit of \(\ln y\):**

   We need to find:
   \[
   \lim_{t \to 1^+} \frac{\ln(t-1)}{t-1}
   \]

   As \( t \to 1^+ \), both \(\ln(t-1)\) and \(t-1\) approach \(-\infty\) and \(0^+\), respectively, resulting in an indeterminate form \(\frac{-\infty}{0^+}\).

3. **Apply L'Hôpital's Rule:**

   Differentiate the numerator and the denominator:
   - Derivative of \(\ln(t-1)\) is \(\frac{1}{t-1}\).
   - Derivative of \(t-1\) is \(1\).

   Apply L'Hôpital's Rule:
   \[
   \lim_{t \to 1^+} \frac{\ln(t-1)}{t-1} = \lim_{t \to 1^+} \frac{1/(t-1)}{1} = \lim_{t \to 1^+} \frac{1}{t-1}
   \]

   As \( t \to 1^+ \), \(\frac{1}{t-1} \to +\infty\).

4. **Interpret the Result:**

   Since \(\ln y \to +\infty\), it follows that:
   \[
   y = e^{\ln y} \to e^{+\infty} = +\infty
   \]

### Conclusion:

The limit is:
\[
\lim_{t \to 1^+} (t-1)^{1/(t-1)} = +\infty
\] 

This approach uses logarithmic transformation and L'Hôpital's Rule to handle the indeterminate form effectively.

This passage is discussing techniques for solving certain types of limit problems in calculus, particularly when dealing with indeterminate forms. Let's break down the key points:

### Techniques Discussed

1. **Introducing a New Variable**:  
   When a limit problem cannot be solved through direct algebraic manipulation, introducing a new variable \( y \) can help. This often involves setting the expression equal to \( y \) and then taking the natural logarithm of both sides.

2. **Taking Natural Logarithms**:  
   By taking the natural log of an equation involving limits, you can sometimes transform a complex expression into one that is easier to handle. This is particularly useful when dealing with products or powers that result in indeterminate forms like \( \infty^\infty \), \( 0^0 \), etc.

3. **Simplifying Indeterminate Forms**:  
   After taking the natural log, you often end up with expressions involving sums or differences of terms, which can simplify the problem into a form where L'Hôpital's Rule can be applied (e.g., transforming \( 0 \times \infty \) into \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \)).

4. **Applying L'Hôpital's Rule**:  
   This rule is used to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms by differentiating the numerator and the denominator separately. It’s particularly useful after transforming the original problem through logarithms.

5. **Multiplying Numerator and Denominator**:  
   Sometimes, multiplying both the numerator and denominator by a strategic expression can help simplify the limit further, especially when you encounter stubborn indeterminate forms.

### Example Problems

1. **Limit as \( t \to 0 \) of \( (t + 1)^{2/t} \)**:  
   - Introduce \( y = (t + 1)^{2/t} \).
   - Take the natural log: \( \ln(y) = \frac{2}{t} \ln(t + 1) \).
   - Simplify and apply L'Hôpital's Rule to resolve the indeterminate form.

2. **Limit as \( t \to \infty \) of \( (t + 1)^{2/t} \)**:  
   - Similar steps as above, but now dealing with \( \infty^0 \).
   - Transform and simplify using logarithms and L'Hôpital's Rule.

### Conclusion

The passage emphasizes the investigative nature of solving these problems. It encourages persistence and creativity in applying mathematical tools to navigate through complex limit problems. By transforming expressions into more manageable forms, using logarithms, and strategically applying L'Hôpital's Rule, one can often find a path to the solution.
