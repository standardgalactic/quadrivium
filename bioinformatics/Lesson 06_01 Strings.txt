in this lesson we're going to look at working with characters and strings first let's just
make sure that our kernel has loaded as usual I just make use of that little function I'm
just going to add two plus two and let's wait for it we get four everything seems to work
so working with characters letters and strings so we're interested here in words and sentences
and letters anything that you can that you can write that makes sense as characters now Julia
can do both ASCII that's the American Standard Code for Information Interchange and the Unicode
characters now remember the ASCII set of characters they just map the integer values of 0 to 127 to a
specific character say a b c a backslash a full stop a space all of those things on your keyboard
they just have an integer value and then the Unicode set of characters many many more there's
about 120 000 characters from as you can see there are 129 modern and not so modern scripts
because really when we talk about characters when we talk about sentences we talk about language
and a computer has to be able to represent most of those so what are we going to look at we're going
to just introduce some strings so you can become comfortable with how Julia deals with them we're
going to look at sub strings we're going to look at individual characters because Julia can deal with
individual characters it's a different data type a different type I should just say and then a full
string we're going to split and join certain strings we're going to convert strings into integers
and we're going to look at some other conversions we're going to find and replace characters and
sub strings inside of other strings because that's what we ultimately care about we want to get some
information that we can use say for instance in data science out of the characters and then lastly
something which some people love some people hate but certainly certainly quite interesting we're going
to get to grips with some regular expressions or the use of regular expressions in Julia let's get started
