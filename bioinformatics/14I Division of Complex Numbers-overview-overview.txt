The text outlines a method for finding the inverse of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix and verifying it through multiplication with the identity matrix. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Matrix Inversion Formula**: For a \(2 \times 2\) matrix \(A = \begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{pmatrix}\), its inverse is calculated as:
   \[
   A^{-1} = \frac{1}{AD - BC} \begin{pmatrix} D & -B \\ -C & A \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This involves swapping \(A\) and \(D\), changing the signs of \(B\) and \(C\), and dividing by the determinant, \(AD - BC\).

2. **Example Calculation**: For matrix \(A = \begin{pmatrix} I & -2 \\ 1 & I \end{pmatrix}\):
   - The determinant is \(I^2 - (-2) = 1\).
   - Thus, the inverse is:
     \[
     A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} I & 2 \\ -1 & I \end{pmatrix}
     \]

3. **Verification**: By multiplying \(A\) and \(A^{-1}\), you obtain the identity matrix:
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} I & -2 \\ 1 & I \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} I & 2 \\ -1 & I \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

4. **Complex Numbers**: When dealing with matrices involving complex numbers, like \(A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & I \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\), division by a complex number is necessary. Using the complex conjugate simplifies calculations, ensuring that multiplication results in the identity matrix.

The text highlights the importance of understanding and practicing complex number division correctly to avoid mistakes, especially when dealing with challenging problems. It emphasizes consistent practice using proper techniques to build confidence and accuracy in these mathematical operations.
