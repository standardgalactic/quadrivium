This text outlines methods for calculating limits in calculus, particularly when direct application of limit laws is hindered by indeterminate forms like 0/0. Here's a summary:

1. **Limit Laws and Indeterminate Forms**: Limit laws are only applicable if the limit exists. When encountering a 0/0 form, these laws cannot be used directly.

2. **Factorization**: For expressions resulting in 0/0 upon substitution, factorizing can help. By factoring terms like \(t^2 - 4\) into \((t-2)(t+2)\) and recognizing equivalences such as \(2-t = -(t-2)\), you can simplify the expression to resolve the indeterminate form.

3. **Using Powers**: For functions involving powers or roots, calculate the limit of the inner function first before applying the power or root, like in cube root functions \(\lim_{t \to 2} (\text{f(t)})^{1/3}\).

4. **Rationalizing**: Rationalization is useful for complex expressions with square roots. Multiplying by a conjugate can simplify terms such as \(\frac{\sqrt{t+2} - \sqrt{2}}{t}\), allowing for direct substitution after simplification.

5. **Direct Substitution**: If substituting the limit value directly does not lead to an indeterminate form, then this result is the limit.

6. **Strategies Summary**:
   - Start with direct substitution.
   - Use factorization to simplify expressions with indeterminate forms.
   - Apply powers or roots correctly for functions involving these operations.
   - Rationalize numerators (or denominators) in complex square root expressions.

These strategies are illustrated through examples, highlighting the need to recognize and address indeterminate forms to calculate limits successfully.
