The text provides a step-by-step approach to solving a non-homogeneous, linear, third-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The solution is composed of two parts: the complementary (homogeneous) solution and the particular solution.

1. **Complementary Solution**:
   - Start by transforming the original non-homogeneous equation into its homogeneous form: \( y''' - 3y'' + 3y' - y = 0 \).
   - The auxiliary equation derived is \( m^3 - 3m^2 + 3m - 1 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (m-1)^3 = 0 \). This reveals a triple root at \( m=1 \).
   - Consequently, the complementary solution is:
     \[
     y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x + c_3 x^2 e^x
     \]
   where \( c_1, c_2, \) and \( c_3 \) are arbitrary constants.

2. **Particular Solution**:
   - The non-homogeneous term given is \( (x - 4)e^x \).
   - Assume a particular solution of the form: 
     \[
     y_p = ax + b + cx^3 e^x
     \]
   - By differentiating and substituting into the original equation, equate terms to determine the coefficients. The solutions are \( a = -1, b = -3, c = -\frac{2}{3} \).
   - Thus, the particular solution is:
     \[
     y_p = -x - 3 - \frac{2}{3} x^3 e^x
     \]

3. **General Solution**:
   - Combine the complementary and particular solutions to obtain the general solution:
     \[
     y = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x + c_3 x^2 e^x - x - 3 - \frac{2}{3} x^3 e^x
     \]

This method effectively solves the differential equation by separately addressing its homogeneous and non-homogeneous components.
