Checking Meteorology An Introduction/02.Temperature.Pressure.and.Density.avi.txt
1. **Key Concepts in Atmospheric Science**: The lecture emphasizes the importance of temperature, pressure, and density in understanding Earth's atmosphere and its weather patterns. It highlights the concept of hydrostatic balance, which is the equilibrium state between the gravitational force pulling everything towards the Earth and the pressure forces generated by the warming of the air by the Earth.

2. **Hydrostatic Balance**: This balance between gravity and pressure in the atmosphere is maintained despite the tendency for air to rise where it's warm (low density) and fall where it's cool (high density). The lecture uses a rubber band analogy to illustrate this concept, with upward forces representing warming and buoyancy trying to lift the band, and downward gravitational forces pulling it down.

3. **Pressure and Density**: Pressure in the atmosphere decreases exponentially with height due to the weight of the air above. This resistance to mixing is also seen in real-world phenomena like oil and vinegar not blending fully in a bottle, or cold and warm air masses at frontal boundaries.

4. **Atmospheric Struggle**: The atmosphere is constantly under strain due to pressure differences trying to equalize from high to low areas. If these differences were allowed to always resolve by mass moving from high to low pressure, our planet's atmosphere would eventually dissipate into space. However, this doesn't happen because the forces are in balance.

5. **Meteorology and Its History**: The term 'meteorology' comes from Greek and originally encompassed the study of natural phenomena in the sky. Aristotle wrote a book on meteorology, which was a significant contribution to knowledge at the time. Meteorology as a scientific discipline, however, didn't progress significantly until the late 19th and early 20th centuries when advancements in technology, like radar and satellites, allowed for better understanding of weather patterns.

6. **Future Topics**: The lecture prepares students to understand how pressure gradients determine the velocity and intensity of winds, which will be a focus of future lectures. Additionally, the course will explore the composition of the atmosphere, its origin, and the conditions that make Earth habitable.

In summary, the lecture provided an overview of the fundamental forces at play in the Earth's atmosphere, the concept of hydrostatic balance, and the historical development of meteorology as a science. It sets the stage for a deeper dive into atmospheric dynamics and the study of weather patterns.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/03.Atmosphere.Composition.and.Origin.avi.txt
1. **Atmospheric Composition**: The Earth's early atmosphere was primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, but these were lost to space due to Earth's weak gravitational pull. Over time, the atmosphere evolved to include more CO2, nitrogen, sulfur, ammonia, and eventually oxygen, with oxygen becoming abundant through the process of photosynthesis by plants and bacteria.

2. **Atmospheric Layers**: The atmosphere is divided into four main layers: the troposphere (where weather occurs), the stratosphere (which contains the ozone layer), the mesosphere, and the thermosphere. The troposphere is closest to the surface and is where most of the water vapor is located due to the higher temperatures near the ground.

3. **Temperature Profile**: Within the troposphere, temperatures decrease rapidly with altitude due to the cooling effect of expansion as air rises and compressive heating as it descends. This contrasts with the stratosphere, where temperatures increase with altitude due to the absorption of UV radiation by ozone, which adds energy to the air.

4. **Greenhouse Gases**: Minor constituents of the atmosphere, such as CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide, are potent greenhouse gases that regulate Earth's surface temperature. They trap heat and maintain a habitable environment for life on Earth.

5. **Ozone Layer**: The ozone layer in the stratosphere absorbs harmful UV radiation from the Sun, protecting life on Earth. Human-made substances like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have historically depleted the ozone layer, particularly over Antarctica, leading to the formation of the "ozone hole."

6. **Radiation**: The Sun emits a spectrum of radiation that includes ultraviolet (UV) and visible light, which is necessary for photosynthesis and life on Earth. In contrast, Earth emits infrared radiation due to its warmer surface temperature compared to space.

7. **Greenhouse Effect**: This is the process by which radiation from a planet's warm surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases and re-radiated at longer infrared wavelengths back towards the surface, thus warming the atmosphere and surface.

8. **Ongoing Changes**: The composition of the atmosphere continues to evolve, primarily due to human activities that release additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which affects Earth's climate and has implications for our planet's future.

In summary, the Earth's atmosphere has undergone significant changes over time, from its early hydrogen-rich composition to a stable, oxygen-rich environment capable of supporting complex life forms. The atmosphere's layers have distinct properties that play crucial roles in regulating temperature and protecting life. Greenhouse gases are vital for maintaining the planet's warmth, while the ozone layer protects us from harmful radiation. Human influence on atmospheric composition is a key factor in altering Earth's climate system, with significant implications for our future.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/04.Radiation.and.the.Greenhouse.Effect.avi.txt
1. **Electromagnetic Spectrum**: This encompasses a wide range of wavelengths and includes UV, visible light, and IR radiation. The Earth's atmosphere and surface interact with different parts of this spectrum.

2. **Thermal Radiation**: Objects emit thermal radiation based on their temperature. Hotter objects emit radiation with shorter wavelengths, while cooler objects emit radiation with longer wavelengths.

3. **Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)**: These are gases that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation. They play a crucial role in the Earth's climate by trapping some of the heat emitted from the planet's surface, thus acting like a thermostat to maintain a habitable temperature.

4. **Black Bodies and Selective Absorbers**: Black bodies absorb all incident electromagnetic radiation, while selective absorbers are less indiscriminate. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other GHGs are selective absorbers of the longwave radiation emitted by the Earth.

5. **The Greenhouse Effect**: This is the process by which GHGs absorb and re-emit some of the Earth's outgoing infrared radiation, warming the planet above what it would be without this effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps the planet warm enough to support life.

6. **Energy Balance**: The Earth's energy balance involves the incoming solar radiation (about 240 watts per square meter on average) and the outgoing thermal radiation (which varies but is typically less than half of the incoming). The difference between incoming and outgoing energy determines the rate at which the atmosphere is warming.

7. **Feedback Mechanisms**: As temperatures change, feedback mechanisms can either amplify or mitigate the initial change. For example, as the Earth warms, more water vapor, a potent GHG, can be released, leading to further warming (a positive feedback).

8. **Looking Ahead**: In the next lecture, we will explore how solar radiation is distributed unevenly across the planet, leading to the formation of seasons and driving atmospheric circulation. We'll also discuss the mechanisms of conduction and convection, with a focus on the latter as the primary means by which the Earth moves heat energy around.

In summary, the greenhouse effect is a natural yet critical component of the Earth's climate system that maintains a stable temperature conducive to life. However, human activities are increasing the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, leading to enhanced warming and global climate change. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting future climate conditions and for developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic climate change.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/05.Sphericity.Conduction.and.Convection.avi.txt
1. The Earth's spherical shape causes a large temperature difference between the equator and the poles, which is more pronounced during the winter months due to our planet's axial tilt.
2. Without the atmosphere, this temperature difference would be even greater, but the atmosphere plays a crucial role in moderating it through heat transfer processes: conduction (the direct transfer of energy), convection (the movement of warm air), and radiation (the transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves).
3. Conduction is slow in air due to its low thermal conductivity, making it an effective insulator. Objects with high thermal inertia, like water, retain heat for longer periods, while objects with low thermal inertia, such as sand, heat up and cool down rapidly.
4. Thermal inertia is the resistance to temperature change; materials with high thermal inertia change temperature more slowly than those with low thermal inertia.
5. Surface characteristics, including reflectance (albedo) and thermal properties, contribute to the creation of temperature differences. For example, a shiny surface reflects more solar radiation and thus remains cooler, while a dark surface absorbs more heat.
6. Temperature differences lead to pressure differences, which in turn drive winds. The movement of air can transport heat from warmer to cooler areas, reducing temperature extremes.
7. Winds are a key mechanism for mixing the atmosphere and can significantly affect the temperature profile near the Earth's surface. On calm nights, the air is less mixed, leading to colder ground temperatures due to radiative cooling, while on windy nights, the ground tends to be warmer, and the air cooler at altitude.
8. The presence of large bodies of water like oceans, which have high thermal inertia, helps to moderate global temperature extremes by absorbing and storing heat during the day and releasing it at night.
9. In the next lecture, we will explore how local winds, such as sea breezes, form in response to temperature differences created by differential solar heating and surface characteristics.

In summary, understanding the principles of how heat is transferred and how it interacts with different surfaces on Earth is fundamental to meteorology and climate science. These processes not only affect day-to-day weather but also influence long-term climate patterns and the distribution of energy within our planet's system.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/06.Sea.Breezes.and.Santa.Anas.avi.txt
1. **Concept of Wind**: Wind is caused by pressure differences in the atmosphere, which arise due to unequal heating of the Earth's surface.
   
2. **Role of Gravity**: Gravity plays a crucial role in wind patterns as it affects how pressure changes with altitude. The acceleration of gravity (G) determines the rate at which pressure decreases with height and influences the thermal inertia of air, which is measured by Cp (specific heat at constant pressure).

3. **Thermal Inertia (Cp)**: Cp measures how quickly an object heats up or cools down. For dry air, it's 1044 J/kg. The higher the value of Cp, the slower an object will respond to temperature changes.

4. **Rate of Temperature Change with Altitude**: Air warms by approximately 30°F per mile (10°C per kilometer) as it descends due to increased pressure and the effects of gravity. This rate reflects both the mass of the Earth and the composition of the air.

5. **Wind Circulation Examples**:
   - **Sea Breeze**: Occurs during the day when land heats up faster than water, creating a temperature difference that generates a pressure difference, leading to sea breeze.
   - **Land Breeze**: Occurs at night when land cools faster than water, reversing the flow.

6. **Santa Ana Winds**: These are hot, dry winds that originate in the desert and descend towards coastal areas. They become hotter and drier as they lose moisture and gain heat on their descent, posing a significant fire risk due to their dry nature.

7. **Implications for Moisture**: The next lecture will explore how temperature affects humidity, demonstrating that rising air becomes more humid as it expands and the pressure decreases, potentially leading to cloud formation and precipitation.

8. **Future Discussion**: The upcoming lecture will delve into the role of moisture in the atmosphere, including how rising air can lead to clouds and how condensation processes occur within these ascending currents.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/07.An.Introduction.to.Atmospheric.Moisture.avi.txt
1. **Vapor Capacity (VC)**: The amount of water vapor that air at a given temperature and pressure can hold. It increases with higher temperatures but decreases with higher pressures.

2. **Actual Vapor Content (VS)**: The amount of water vapor currently present in the air. This depends on the source region's conditions, such as temperature and pressure.

3. **Relative Humidity (RH)**: The ratio of the actual vapor content to the vapor capacity at the same temperature and pressure. It indicates how close the air is to saturation.

4. **Air Temperature Effect on VC**: As the temperature rises, the vapor capacity increases significantly, allowing for more water vapor in the air. Conversely, as temperatures fall, the air can only hold less moisture before reaching saturation.

5. **Cloud Formation**: Clouds are typically formed by lifting air within the atmosphere, causing cooling and condensation of water vapor into liquid or ice droplets.

6. **Dew and Fog**: Occur most often around sunrise because temperatures are at their lowest during this time, increasing relative humidity as warmer air cools down.

7. **Desert Winds (e.g., Santa Ana winds)**: Can carry air from a moist region to a drier one as it descends and warms due to adiabatic heating, leading to very dry conditions.

8. **Condensation and Freezing Nuclei**: Both processes require a surface to initiate; condensation nuclei are common, but ice nuclei are rare, leading to the existence of supercooled water droplets in clouds.

9. **Cloud Seeding**: An attempt to artificially introduce ice nuclei into clouds to induce or enhance ice crystal formation, potentially leading to precipitation.

10. **Precipitation Formation**: Precipitation forms through the process of nucleation, growth, and collection of water droplets or ice crystals within a cloud until they become heavy enough to fall as rain or snow.

The understanding of vapor capacity, actual vapor content, and relative humidity is crucial for predicting when and where precipitation will occur, and it provides the foundation for studying larger scale weather patterns and storm systems. Cloud seeding represents one method humans have developed to potentially influence weather by augmenting natural processes.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/08.Bringing.Air.to.Saturation.avi.txt
1. **Boiling Point and Elevation**: At higher elevations, the boiling point of water is lower due to the decreased atmospheric pressure. This means that food takes longer to cook because the water reaches a lower temperature before boiling, and the energy from the heat source goes into breaking bonds between water molecules (boiling) rather than heating the water further.

2. **Phase Changes and Latent Heat**: Phase changes, such as melting and boiling, occur at constant temperatures. The energy required for phase changes is called latent heat. For melting ice to water, the latent heat of fusion is involved; for water turning into vapor, the latent heat of vaporization is involved. The latent heat of melting is seven and a half times less than that of vaporization.

3. **Saturating Air**: There are three methods to saturate air:
   - **Cooling**: Decreasing the temperature of the air to reduce its vapor capacity until it equals the vapor supply from the air itself.
   - **Expansion Cooling (Adiabatic Expansion)**: Reducing the pressure of the air without adding or removing heat until the vapor capacity equals the vapor supply.
   - **Isothermal Moisture Addition (Wet Bulb)**: Adding moisture to the air by evaporation while cooling it through evaporative cooling until the air is saturated.

4. **Dew Point**: The dew point is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated as a result of removing heat at constant pressure until the vapor capacity equals the vapor supply.

5. **Wet Bulb Temperature**: This is achieved by cooling the bulb of a psychrometer through evaporation, and it represents an intermediate state between the original air temperature and its dew point. The wet bulb temperature can be lower than both the dry bulb temperature and the dew point when significant evaporative cooling occurs.

6. **Clouds and Stability**: In the next lecture, we will explore how clouds transport heat vertically using latent heat and how the stability of the atmosphere affects this process. Clouds can fuel powerful updrafts by releasing latent heat during condensation, but whether they can do this depends on the atmospheric conditions.

In summary, understanding phase changes, the role of latent heat, and the properties of saturated air is crucial for various applications, including weather prediction, climate modeling, and even cooking. These concepts are foundational in meteorology and are essential for predicting and understanding weather patterns and phenomena.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/09.Clouds.Stability.and.Buoyancy.Part.1.avi.txt
1. **Visual Introduction to Clouds**: We began by acknowledging clouds as both awe-inspiring natural phenomena and essential components of Earth's climate system. We discussed how clouds can affect our perception of light, create shadows, and even generate their own light through the phenomenon of coronal scattering.

2. **Air Parcel Thought Experiment**: To understand cloud formation and weather patterns, we used the air parcel model, which follows a column of air as it changes temperature, humidity, and elevation. This model helps us visualize how air masses behave in different conditions.

3. **Dry vs. Saturated Air Parcels**: We compared two types of air parcels: one that is dry and another that is saturated (holding as much water vapor as it can at its temperature). The dry parcel cools quickly via the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) but cannot rise indefinitely due to expansion cooling. The saturated parcel cools more slowly via the moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALR), and as it releases latent heat through condensation, it can continue to rise even when warmer than its surroundings, provided it remains saturated.

4. **Stability of the Atmosphere**: We discussed the concept of atmospheric stability, which is influenced by the balance between the rates of cooling (DALR or MALR) and the environmental lapse rate (ELR), typically around 6.5°C per kilometer. A stable atmosphere exists when the parcel's ascent temperature remains below the surrounding air; an unstable atmosphere exists when the parcel's ascent temperature rises above the surrounding air, driving convection.

5. **Implications for Weather and Climate**: The interaction between saturated air parcels and the environment can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. This dynamic balance is crucial for understanding weather patterns and climate phenomena, such as why clouds form preferentially near the surface and not always, and why certain regions experience thunderstorms while others do not.

6. **Looking Forward**: We previewed upcoming topics that will further elucidate the complexities of the atmosphere, including how mountains influence cloud formation, why deserts can form in the lee of mountain ranges, the energy sources for thunderstorms, and the reasons behind the rarity of thunderstorms.

In summary, clouds are a manifestation of the delicate balance between heating, cooling, condensation, and convection within our atmosphere. The properties of air parcels as they rise or fall determine how water vapor interacts with the environment, leading to the myriad forms we see in the sky. Understanding these processes is key to predicting weather patterns and managing the impacts of climate change.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/10.Clouds.Stability.and.Buoyancy.Part.2.avi.txt
1. **Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR)**: The rate at which temperature decreases with height in the troposphere is known as the environmental lapse rate. It varies with time and location due to surface heating, radiation, and convection.

2. **Air Parcel Lift**: When an air parcel is lifted from the ground, it will saturate if the temperature of the parcel drops below its dew point as it ascends along the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR). This saturation occurs when the parcel reaches its lifting condensation level (LCL).

3. **Moist Adiabatic Lapse Rate (MALR)**: Once saturated, an air parcel will continue to cool at a slower rate known as the moist adiabatic lapse rate. This occurs because the release of latent heat during condensation warms the ascending air.

4. **Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)**: CAPE represents the energy available for convection in the atmosphere. High CAPE values indicate the potential for strong, upward storm motion, which can lead to severe weather.

5. **Lift and Condensation**: The ability to create clouds and storms depends on both lifting mechanisms and the presence of moisture. Sufficient lift must overcome the stability of the lower atmosphere, and the air parcel must have enough moisture to condense as it ascends.

6. **Afternoon Cloud Formation**: In the afternoon, surface heating increases the environmental lapse rate near the ground, making it easier to lift an air parcel to its saturation point because the LCL is higher. This often results in the formation of cumulus clouds, which can be seen as "pearls on a string" from the ground.

7. **Desert Boundaries**: The way air ascends and whether it maintains its moisture content as it rises can determine if a desert will form on the lee side of a mountain range.

8. **Forecasting Challenges**: Forecasting severe weather involves understanding both the lift available (which depends on the environment) and the moisture available. A lack of either can prevent storm formation.

9. **Future Lectures**: The next lecture will focus on horizontal winds, including what drives them, their direction, and their intensity, as these factors are crucial for understanding how atmospheric conditions lead to different weather patterns and events.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/11.Whence.and.Whither.the.Wind_Part1.avi.txt
1. **Geostrophic Balance**: This is a condition where the horizontal pressure gradient force (PGF) and the Coriolis force are balanced, resulting in steady, straight-line wind flow parallel to the isobars. In the northern hemisphere, this wind blows with low pressure to the left; in the southern hemisphere, it blows with low pressure to the right.

2. **Pressure Gradient Force (PGF)**: This force acts from high to low pressure and is a measure of how much the air wants to move in response to a pressure difference. The steeper the isobars, the stronger the PGF.

3. **Coriolis Force**: This fictitious force is a result of Earth's rotation and deflects moving objects to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. It plays a crucial role in steering the geostrophic wind.

4. **Wind Direction**: The direction of the geostrophic wind is determined by the orientation of the isobars (blowing parallel to them) and the Coriolis effect (deflecting the wind so that it blows with low pressure to the left or right, depending on hemisphere).

5. **Wind Speed**: The speed of the geostrophic wind is influenced by the spacing between isobars. As isobars get closer together, the wind speed increases because the balance between PGF and Coriolis force requires a faster wind to overcome the tighter turn necessary to follow closely spaced isobars.

6. **Isobars as a Guide**: While isobars are not physical barriers, they provide a useful guide for determining the direction (by their orientation) and speed (by their spacing) of the geostrophic wind. The closer the isobars, the faster the wind.

7. **Exceptions to Geostrophic Balance**: There are situations where air can flow across isobars, such as local sea breezes or when other forces like gravity (orographic lift) or friction become significant. These exceptions lead to airflow patterns that deviate from the geostrophic wind.

8. **Equator-to-Pole Winds**: The Coriolis effect prevents a direct hemispheric sea breeze from flowing from pole to equator due to the curving of the air paths and the deflection caused by Earth's rotation.

In summary, the geostrophic wind is a fundamental concept in meteorology that describes how surface winds are balanced between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis effect. It helps us understand why winds tend to blow parallel to closely spaced isobars, with the direction adjusted by the Coriolis deflection, and why the wind speed increases as those isobars get closer together.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/12.Whence.and.Whither.the.Wind_Part.2.avi.txt
1. **Friction**: Frictional forces near the Earth's surface act against the Coriolis force and disturb the geostrophic balance, leading to actual wind flow towards low-pressure areas, even though the ideal geostrophic balance would have the winds blowing parallel to the pressure gradient.

2. **Centripetal/Centrifugal Forces**: These forces are a result of spin and appear wherever there is rotation. They can be interpreted as centripetal (inward) or centrifugal (outward), depending on the perspective, but they are essentially the same force that provides the necessary "turn" in the gradient wind balance.

3. **Gradient Wind Balance**: This occurs when the pressure gradient force, Coriolis force, and centripetal/centrifugal forces are in equilibrium. It explains why winds circulate counterclockwise around low-pressure systems and clockwise around high-pressure systems.

4. **Cyclostrophic Balance**: This balance accounts for the effect of spin on atmospheric pressure, showing that rotation can lead to lower pressure at the center of circulation, thus supporting the formation of cyclones. Conversely, it indicates that increasing the rotational speed of an anticyclone would actually reduce its central pressure, making it less stable and more difficult to maintain.

5. **Association of Weather with Pressure Systems**: Low-pressure systems are associated with converging air at the surface due to friction, leading to uplift and potentially stormy weather. High-pressure systems, on the other hand, are associated with diverging air and clear skies as air descends.

6. **Super-geostrophic Winds**: Around high-pressure systems, the winds tend to be faster than the geostrophic wind because they are accelerated by the centrifugal force due to the Earth's rotation.

7. **Sub-geostrophic Winds**: Around low-pressure systems, the winds tend to be slower than the geostrophic wind because they are decelerated by the centripetal force due to the Earth's rotation.

8. **Next Steps**: In the following lecture, we will explore the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns on a rotating Earth with an equator-to-pole temperature gradient, and discuss how planetary rotation and sphericity contribute to climate patterns such as the Sahara's aridity.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/13.The.Global.Atmospheric.Circulation.avi.txt
1. **Hemispheric Circulation**: The Earth's spherical shape and rotation, combined with uneven solar heating (temperature gradients), lead to three large-scale atmospheric circulation cells in each hemisphere: the polar cell, the midlatitude westerlies, and the tropical easterlies.

2. **Polar Cell**: This cell consists of ascent above a surface low at the poles and descent above a surface high near 60°N (the Aleutian Low in the North Pacific and the Icelandic Low in the North Atlantic), with westerly winds in between. This circulation pattern brings moist, warm air into the polar regions and is responsible for the relatively mild and wet weather in these areas.

3. **Midlatitude Westerlies**: These westerly winds circle the globe near 30°N to 60°N, influenced by the subtropical highs over the eastern Pacific (Pacific High) and eastern Atlantic Oceans (Bermuda High). These highs steer storm paths and influence the climate of the regions they dominate.

4. **Tropical Easterlies**: Near the equator, the trade winds converge to form the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which is characterized by strong surface low pressure, heavy rainfall, and high humidity. The ITCZ migrates north and south with the seasons due to the Earth's tilt and the distribution of land and sea.

5. **Air Masses**: These are large regions of air with similar properties (temperature, moisture, and density) formed over continents or oceans. Air masses gain their characteristics from the surface below them and can be identified by their sources: cold polar air masses (CP), tropical continental air masses (CT), and maritime tropical air masses (MT).

6. **Fronts**: Boundaries where different air masses meet, fronts separate masses of air with different properties. They are the sites of significant weather changes, including lifting that leads to cloud formation and precipitation.

7. **Weather Patterns**: The interaction of air masses and fronts can lead to a variety of weather patterns, including extra-tropical cyclones that develop along fronts and can be influenced by the underlying surface pressure systems.

In summary, the Earth's atmosphere circulates in three large cells per hemisphere due to uneven solar heating, the Coriolis effect, and the planet's rotation. These cells are characterized by distinct pressure patterns and wind directions, which influence the climate of different regions. Air masses contribute to the weather by interacting at fronts, leading to various atmospheric phenomena, including precipitation and cyclonic activity. In the next lecture, we will explore these interactions in more detail, focusing on the dynamics of fronts and their role in weather systems.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/14.Fronts.and.Extratropical.Cyclones.avi.txt
1. **Weather Map Interpretation**: We learned how to interpret surface weather charts, including the symbols for highs (H), lows (L), fronts (C, O), and stationary fronts (D). We understood that fronts are boundaries between different air masses and that weather patterns can be predicted by analyzing these features.

2. **Extra Tropical Cyclone Life Cycle**: We examined the life cycle of an extra tropical cyclone from its formation through maturity to occlusion using a real-world example. We noted that these systems form on the fronts, are sustained by the density differences across the fronts, and eventually dissipate when the low pressure center is cut off from its energy source.

3. **Wind Direction Adjustment**: We discussed the importance of adjusting station pressures to sea level when determining wind direction and magnitude. This is necessary because the pressure at a location above sea level will differ from that at sea level due to altitude, and this difference can affect the calculated geostrophic wind.

4. **Sea Level Pressure Adjustment**: To accurately determine the wind direction between two locations with different elevations, we adjust all pressures to a common reference level, typically sea level. This allows us to account for altitude effects and provides a more accurate representation of the pressure gradient force.

5. **Future Topics**: We previewed the upcoming lectures where we will explore the atmospheric circulation patterns above the surface. We will learn about upper air charts, troughs, ridges, warm advection, and positive vorticity adjustment, which are crucial for understanding the formation, movement, and dissipation of extra tropical cyclones.

6. **Key Concepts**: The lectures emphasized the importance of understanding atmospheric processes such as pressure systems, fronts, and the geostrophic wind balance. These concepts are essential for meteorologists to predict weather patterns accurately.

7. **Summary of the Lecture's Content**: The lecture provided a comprehensive overview of how to read surface weather charts and interpret the symbols used to represent different atmospheric features. It demonstrated the importance of pressure adjustments for accurate wind direction predictions and set the stage for deeper exploration into the upper air patterns that influence extra tropical cyclone behavior.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/15.Middle.Troposphere.Troughs.and.Ridges.avi.txt
1. **PVA (Positive Vorticity Advection) and Low Pressure Formation**: PVA is a key factor in forming low-pressure systems, including extra-tropical cyclones. It occurs when warm air advection at the surface leads to increased spin of the winds at higher atmospheric levels (500 millibars), which in turn lowers the heights on those isobaric surfaces and creates low pressure at the surface.

2. **Role of Troughs and Ridges**: The undulating troughs and ridges in the 500 millibar charts represent waves in the atmosphere, such as Rossby waves. These features can influence the position and intensity of extra-tropical cyclones by moving them and by providing or enhancing vorticity.

3. **Extra-Tropical Cyclone Life Cycle**: The life cycle of an extra-tropical cyclone is influenced by the interaction between height fields (troughs and ridges) and vorticity. For a cyclone to intensify, it requires sustained deep tropospheric ascent, which can be induced by either warm air advection or positive vorticity advection.

4. **Competing Mechanisms**: There are two main mechanisms that can create deep ascent: warm air advection and positive vorticity advection. These mechanisms can act independently or together to strengthen a cyclone.

5. **Cyclone Filling**: Once the trough associated with the cyclone moves beyond the surface low, the cyclone loses its source of deep ascent. Without this ascent, the system begins to fill, as convergence into the low from the surface is no longer offset by divergent ascent within the cyclone. This leads to the cyclone dissipating and eventually disappearing.

6. **Predicting Extra-Tropical Cyclones**: Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting weather patterns. Forecasters must consider how winds will shift, how much ascent might occur, and whether these processes will cooperate to intensify a cyclone or lead to its demise.

In summary, the formation, intensification, and decay of extra-tropical cyclones are closely tied to the dynamics of height fields, vorticity advection, and the interaction between the Earth's rotation and the atmospheric circulation. These concepts are fundamental to understanding and predicting the weather in mid-latitude regions.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/16.Wind.Shear.Horizontal.and.Vertical.avi.txt
1. **Atmospheric Circulation and Isotherms**: We discussed how the pattern of atmospheric circulation is influenced by factors such as solar radiation, sphericity (the shape of the Earth), atmospheric absorbers, and the thermal inertia of the Earth's surface. The results are the global distribution of temperatures, which we represent with isotherms on a sigma chart. In the tropics, these isotherms are nearly horizontal, indicating minimal temperature changes with altitude and thus minimal wind shear.

2. **Winter vs. Summer**: During winter in the mid-latitudes, the isotherms are more vertical, meaning there is a larger horizontal gradient in temperature. This creates stronger vertical wind shear, which is associated with the westerly jet streams. In summer, the heating of the Earth's surface becomes more uniform across latitudes, leading to weaker horizontal temperature gradients and less vertical wind shear, making the subtropical jet a shadow of its winter self.

3. **Role of Shear**: The concept of shear was central to this lecture. Horizontal shear can create vorticity, which is essential for the development and intensification of extratropical cyclones. Vertical wind shear is also crucial; it is generated by the temperature gradient in the horizontal and can influence storms by affecting the updrafts within them.

4. **Consequences of Shear**: The presence of shear affects low-pressure systems, promoting deep ascent in the troposphere, which is vital for storm development. It also plays a significant role in determining the structure and intensity of weather systems, with both positive and negative impacts depending on the circumstances.

5. **Final Thoughts**: The atmospheric circulation is a complex and dynamic system that is influenced by various factors and exhibits different patterns at different times and altitudes. The concepts of shear, both horizontal and vertical, are key to understanding the behavior of weather systems and the overall workings of our atmosphere. As we move forward in the course, we will continue to explore the implications of these dynamics, especially as they relate to storms and severe weather events.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/17.Mountain.Influences.on.the.Atmosphere.avi.txt
1. **Role of Mountains in Weather:**
   - Mountains create disturbances in the atmosphere as air flows over, around, and through them.
   - They can produce a variety of weather phenomena, including waves, clouds, thunderstorms, and cyclones.

2. **Wave Production:**
   - Mountains generate atmospheric waves that can affect the weather both locally and far away.
   - These waves can propagate vertically in the atmosphere, leading to bumpy flights at high altitudes or more confined disturbances closer to the ground.

3. **Trapped Waves and Downslope Winds:**
   - Trapped waves can cause clouds and strong winds over the mountains and downwind in the lee.
   - Downslope winds in the lee of mountain ranges can be very strong, often ending abruptly at a hydraulic jump.

4. **Lee-Side Cyclogenesis:**
   - Vertical stretching of air parcels over mountains increases their spin, which lowers pressure.
   - This process can lead to the formation of troughs and extra-tropical cyclones, particularly in the lee of north-south oriented mountain ranges like the Rockies.
   - The formation of these cyclones is more likely due to the west to east flow of mid-latitude winds over the mountains.

5. **Potential for Thunderstorm Development:**
   - The lifting effect of mountains can also lead to the development of deep cumulus clouds and, in some cases, thunderstorms.

6. **Future Discussion:**
   - In the next lecture, we will explore the formation and characteristics of thunderstorms, which are a direct result of the lifting and instability provided by mountainous terrain and other mechanisms.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/18.Thunderstorms.Squall.Lines.and.Radar.avi.txt
1. **Extra Tropical Cyclone and Squall Line Formation**: We discussed the development of an extra tropical cyclone, which is a low-pressure area with strong winds that forms outside of the tropics. This system can generate a squall line, a long line of thunderstorms that often precedes and follows the cold front of the cyclone.

2. **Wind Patterns**: We identified the two main wind patterns associated with an extra tropical cyclone: northwesterly winds behind the cold front and southwesterly winds in the warm sector, which is the area of warm, moist air ahead of the cold front.

3. **Squall Line Movement**: The squall line tends to move as its cold pool spreads, often parallel to the cold front but can get ahead of it as seen in the case study.

4. **Sounding Analysis**: We examined a sounding from the warm sector that showed the necessary ingredients for thunderstorm development: low CAPE (convective available potential energy), which indicates the amount of energy available for convection, and strong lifting mechanisms. The sounding indicated that even a small amount of lift could trigger a thunderstorm due to the high CAPE values present.

5. **Skew-T Diagrams**: We introduced skew-T diagrams as an alternative way to present atmospheric data, which can be more intuitive for interpreting lifting processes and environmental stability.

6. **Radar Observations**: Radar is a critical tool for detecting thunderstorms by identifying larger precipitation particles within the cloud. These particles are the result of colliding cloud droplets that have grown into raindrops, contributing to both updrafts and downdrafts within the storm system.

7. **Squall Line Characteristics**: We learned that squall lines are short-lived, typically lasting about 30 to 40 minutes before they become too saturated and dissipate. However, new cells can form as the squall line moves forward into fresh sources of moist, unstable air.

8. **Future Topics**: We previewed the next lecture, which will cover supercell thunderstorms—a more complex type of storm that relies on wind shear to create horizontal rotation and potentially lead to tornadoes.

In summary, the lecture covered the formation and behavior of squall lines within the context of extra tropical cyclones, the role of atmospheric soundings in understanding thunderstorm potential, and the use of radar in observing these phenomena. It also provided a preview of the complexities associated with supercell thunderstorms and their relationship with wind shear.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/19.Supercells.Tornadoes.and.Dry.Lines.avi.txt
1. **Tornado Formation in Supercells**: Tornadoes form within supercell thunderstorms when vertical wind shear is strongly tilted into horizontal spin. This process involves two counter-rotating vortices within the storm, one on the left side (left mover) and one on the right side (right mover). The right mover typically dominates due to the Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect) and vertical wind shear that tends to increase with height. Tornadoes usually acquire the sense of rotation from the right mover and are often counter-clockwise.

2. **Wall Cloud**: A wall cloud is a distinctive feature of a supercell, characterized by the presence of large horizontal rotation near the updraft region. It can serve as an indicator of potential tornado formation, as the cloud base lowers due to the spin within the mesocyclone. The air within the mesocyclone becomes saturated and is drawn in, expanding and causing the cloud base to drop.

3. **Large Hail**: Large hail, defined as greater than three-quarters of an inch or the size of a penny, can occur with supercells due to strong updrafts that lift water droplets into the colder upper atmosphere where they freeze and enlarge into hailstones.

4. **Environment for Supercells**: Supercells require convective available potential energy (CAPE) and significant vertical wind shear. The ratio of CAPE to shear, known as the bulk Richardson number (BRI or BRN), can indicate the likelihood of supercell formation, with values below 50 suggesting a higher probability.

5. **Severe Weather Hazards**: Severe weather associated with supercells includes tornadoes, large hail, and sometimes damaging straight-line winds. These events can cause significant damage and pose serious risks to life and property.

6. **Radar Signatures**: On radar, supercells may exhibit hooks echoes that are associated with the mesocyclone's rotation. Radar can also sometimes directly detect the rotation within the storm, providing limited wind information.

7. **Summary of Wild Weather Topics**: The course has covered various extreme weather phenomena, including tornadoes, large hail, and hurricanes. Understanding the atmospheric conditions that lead to these events is crucial for forecasting and mitigating their impacts. The next topic will delve into ocean circulation and its role in the formation of hurricanes.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/20.Ocean.Influences.on.Weather.and.Climate.avi.txt
1. **Atmosphere-Ocean Interactions:** The atmosphere and ocean systems are interconnected; pressure in both systems is influenced by mass (weight), with water being much denser than air, leading to faster increases in pressure with depth in the ocean.

2. **Thermocline:** The transition zone between the warm upper layer of the ocean and the colder deep water, whose depth varies based on surface water patterns and upwelling.

3. **Ocean Currents:** Surface winds influence ocean currents; in the northern hemisphere, these currents tend to be clockwise around subtropical highs due to the Coriolis effect (Ekman transport).

4. **Ekman Spiral:** The distribution of wind stress on the sea surface leads to an Ekman spiral, where the surface water tends to move at a right angle to the wind direction, resulting in the California Current off the west coast of North America and influencing ocean circulation patterns.

5. **Walker Circulation:** The atmospheric circulation pattern influenced by the trade winds and the surface currents in the Pacific Ocean, which can shift leading to significant impacts on weather and climate patterns, particularly in the tropics.

6. **Thermohaline Circulation:** Long-term ocean circulation driven by differences in both temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline), with the North Atlantic being a critical region where surface waters become dense and sink due to cooling and salt accumulation, eventually feeding back into the warm tropical surface waters.

7. **Impact on Climate:** Changes in ocean circulation, such as those potentially caused by climate change, can have profound effects on global weather patterns and regional climates, including the possibility of slowing down the Gulf Stream and affecting Europe's climate.

8. **Winter Storms:** The ocean plays a significant role in the development of winter storms in the continental U.S., particularly along the Texas coast and the Atlantic coast north of Florida, where large temperature contrasts between warm coastal waters and cold land enhance storm development.

9. **Future Topics:** The next lecture will focus on the role of the oceans in generating tropical cyclones, such as hurricanes and typhoons.

In summary, the atmosphere-ocean system is a complex, interdependent interaction where each influences the other in numerous ways. Pressure gradients, thermal contrasts, ocean currents, and large-scale circulations all play roles in shaping weather and climate patterns across the globe. The upcoming lecture will delve into the specific impact of oceans on the formation and behavior of tropical cyclones.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/21.Tropical.Cyclones.avi.txt
1. **Eye Wall Sloping**: In a hurricane, as the parcel of air ascends within the storm, it must move outward radially with height to conserve its angular momentum because the horizontal pressure gradient and cyclonic winds decrease with altitude. This results in the eye wall sloping upwards due to the radial inflow and the conservation of angular momentum.

2. **Eye Wall Replacement**: In some hurricanes, the original eye wall contracts, leading to an eye wall replacement cycle. During this cycle, a new eye wall forms farther out, which can lead to a stronger storm as it increases wind speeds and lowers central pressure. This process may repeat itself over time.

3. **Hurricane Formation Factors**: Tropical cyclones often form where there is pre-existing vertical vorticity and existing thunderstorms, such as in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Horizontal shear in the atmosphere can also contribute to vertical vorticity.

4. **Easterly Waves**: These propagating disturbances are similar to extra-tropical waves like Rossby waves and often originate as squall lines over West Africa, influencing the formation of hurricanes in the Atlantic.

5. **Tropical Cyclone Frequency**: The frequency of tropical cyclones varies by region. The West Pacific sees the most activity with an average of 26 storms per year, while the East Pacific and the Atlantic see fewer, with around 14 and 9 named storms per year, respectively.

6. **Naming Tropical Cyclones**: Historically, tropical cyclones were named after saints or using the military alphabet. Today, they are named from lists of names that alternate every six years, with male and female names used interchangeably since 1979. Notable names are retired if their storms cause significant damage or loss of life.

7. **Lightning**: As we transition to the next topic, we should remember that lightning is a related phenomenon to thunderstorms, which are also a crucial component of hurricane formation and intensity. Lightning occurs within powerful thunderstorms when charged particles in storm clouds (caused by strong updrafts) reach the ice phase boundary and discharge through the atmosphere or to the ground. This will be the focus of our next lecture.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/22.Light.and.Lightning.avi.txt
1. **Why the Sky is Blue**: The sky appears blue due to the scattering of short wavelength light by atmospheric molecules like nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter sunlight more effectively at shorter wavelengths, which are the blues and violets, compared to longer wavelengths like reds and oranges. As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it scatters in all directions, with more blue light being scattered into our line of sight than other colors during the day.

2. **Atmospheric Refraction**: Light bends when it passes through different media, such as raindrops or atmospheric layers with varying densities. This refraction is responsible for the twinkling of stars and the colorful sunsets where longer wavelengths (reds and oranges) are scattered out, leaving the shorter wavelengths (blues and greens) to reach our eyes.

3. **Rainbows**: Rainbows occur when a beam of light is refracted, reflected inside water droplets, and then refracted again. The angle at which this happens determines the color of the spectrum we see, with red on the outer arc and violet on the inner arc.

4. **Ozone Absorption**: Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs the higher energy light waves, which contributes to the blue appearance during the twilight hours known as the "blue hour."

5. **Lightning**: Lightning is a natural discharge of electricity that occurs during thunderstorms. It occurs when charge separation within clouds becomes too great, leading to the movement of electrical charges between regions of opposite charge within or between clouds and the ground. The process involves collisions of small and large ice particles with super cool liquid. Negative cloud-to-ground lightning is more common than positive because of the way charge separates and flows in atmospheric conditions.

6. **Effects of Pollution on Weather and Lightning**: Urban pollution can affect weather patterns and the formation of clouds by providing an abundance of condensation nuclei, leading to smaller initial cloud droplets. This can delay the growth of cloud droplets into raindrops and potentially increase lightning activity due to the increased surface area for charge separation.

7. **Numerical Weather Prediction Models**: The course has used numerical models to simulate various atmospheric phenomena, including weather forecasting and the flow of substances like molasses on a table. In the upcoming lectures, we will explore how these models are constructed, their strengths and limitations, and their applications in understanding and predicting natural processes.

The course has aimed to demystify the beauty and complexity of the atmosphere by providing scientific explanations for phenomena such as the color of the sky, the formation of rainbows, and the occurrence of lightning, while also considering the impact of human activity on these processes.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/23.Prediction.and.Predictability.avi.txt
 In this lecture, we delved into the differences between weather and climate, emphasizing that weather is the short-term conditions of the atmosphere at a certain place and time, while climate is the average of weather patterns over longer periods. Climate models are used to understand and predict long-term changes in these averages, not to forecast specific weather events far into the future.

Weather prediction models, which are separate from climate models, use initial conditions and atmospheric tendencies to forecast the weather by extrapolating into the future. These models have limitations due to resolution, the need to parameterize unresolved processes, and the inherent uncertainty in both initial conditions and parameterizations. This uncertainty means that forecast errors will increase over time, leading to a limit of predictability, which for the weather is typically around one to two weeks.

The improvements in model resolution, data quality, and parameterization methods are ongoing, but they do not eliminate the fundamental limitations imposed by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. The sensitivity to initial conditions, as demonstrated by Edward Lorenz's seminal work, means that even with perfect models, small discrepancies in initial measurements can lead to vastly different forecast outcomes.

In summary, while weather prediction and climate modeling are powerful tools for understanding and anticipating atmospheric behavior, they come with inherent uncertainties and limitations. These challenges highlight the importance of continuous improvement in observational data quality, model resolution, and parameterization techniques to enhance the accuracy and predictability of both weather forecasts and climate projections.

Checking Meteorology An Introduction/24.The.Imperfect.Forecast.avi.txt
1. **Complexity of Atmospheric Processes**: The parameterization of microphysical processes in atmospheric models, such as the fall speed of snowflakes and particle size, introduces significant complexity and uncertainty in weather forecasting due to the wide range of variables affecting condensation, precipitation, and storm tracking.

2. **Importance of Microphysics**: Changes in microphysical assumptions can lead to different forecast tracks because they affect how snowflakes and cloud droplets behave, which in turn influences the storm's development and its interaction with the environment.

3. **Impact on the Storm Track**: The evolution of hurricanes depends on the behavior of their particles (snowflakes and cloud droplets), which affects the formation of the hurricane's anvil cloud, temperature changes, and subsequent pressure gradients that dictate the storm's path.

4. **Real-World Examples**: Historical examples like Hurricanes Rita and Ike demonstrate how weather forecasting can be affected by the subtle differences in model representations of these microphysical processes.

5. **Nature's Extremes**: The course has explored nature's most extreme phenomena, such as hail, typhoons, tornadoes, lightning, and thunder, as manifestations of underlying imbalances or stresses within the Earth's system.

6. **Climate vs. Weather**: The lectures have highlighted the difference between weather and climate, with weather representing nature's more immediate and extreme reactions, while climate reflects longer-term averages and trends.

7. **Course Reflection**: The course has aimed to explain meteorological phenomena using simple concepts but recognizes that nature can be deceptively complex. The course has answered many questions about weather and climate patterns, including why the sea breeze cools coastal cities and how the Pacific Ocean's El Niño phenomenon affects global weather.

8. **Final Thoughts**: The course concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding meteorological principles to appreciate the complexity and unpredictability of the atmosphere. It also addresses a practical example of how to safely handle aircraft cabin pressure in an emergency.
