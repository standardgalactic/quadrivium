Lecture 21 Colonial Africa, New Realities
Welcome.
By the first decade of the 20th century, the scramble for Africa, which we examined
in our last lecture, was over.
Virtually all of the continent belonged to one or another European Empire, French, British,
Portuguese, Belgian, German, the odd corner or two for Spain or Italy.
The exceptions, the only exceptions, were Ethiopia, where the Emperor's army had repelled
an Italian advance in 1896, and Liberia, which had been created by former slaves from the
United States.
Colonial Africa then was a reality.
What difference did this make?
Although colonies surely varied one from another and changed over time, they shared some fundamental
characteristics which we outline in this lecture.
In the next we will look at some of those variations and some of those changes in more detail.
All the colonial powers, naturally enough, sought economic gain from their new possessions.
We know from our survey of the forces behind the scramble that economic factors were among
the various motivations leading them to go into Africa in the first place.
After all, colonial conquest and occupation was not cheap.
It was expensive in both financial and a human sense.
It cost money and it cost blood.
It was not surprising, therefore it is not surprising, that they expected some return
on that investment.
How would they seek it?
They sought it primarily by pursuing a far more thoroughgoing exploitation of Africa's
raw material products than had previously been possible.
By raw materials I refer primarily to things coming out of the earth, either mineral resources
or cash crops.
This tended in the 20th century then to become mono-economies.
Let us introduce that term.
I think it will have relevance and application in later lectures as well.
Mono-economies specializing in the increased production for export of a single commodity.
Now it's a slight overstatement actually to say mono-economy.
It might be two commodities or three.
But nonetheless the notion of this intense concentration on one or at most a few commodity
products for export became characteristic of virtually all the colonial economies.
Over time in the 20th century then territories become identified with in some cases become
almost synonymous with a certain kind of primary product so that Senegal becomes synonymous
with peanuts.
The ivory and gold coasts, although they're obviously named for other kinds of things
coming out of Africa in an earlier period, become identified in the 20th century with
cocoa, Kenya synonymous with tea and coffee production, Uganda with cotton, the Belgian
Congo with rubber and copper, Northern Rhodesia as well with copper and so on.
Now to move these products from the points of production, the places where they were
actually produced either farmed or mined, to move them to the ocean ports and from those
ports of course across the oceans back to the mother country of the empires or onto
to global markets, to move these products from points of production to the ports required
obviously transport infrastructure.
Indeed, the most lasting genuine investment made by the colonial powers and it was a real
investment in Africa consisted of the railway lines constructed in the first three decades
of the 20th century.
When I say a lasting investment, I mean precisely that.
It is still true today that Africa's principal railway lines and most of the main highways
parallel them as well, these railway lines are predominantly the lines that were built
in the first three decades of the century.
Obviously the tracks and rails themselves have had to be replaced periodically.
But these investments were real investments, again this was not cheap and return was needed
and expected from them.
If you look at a map of Africa with the stuff that we're used to seeing removed, that is
remove the borders, remove the geological or the physical information about the geography
and so for just a map with nothing but the railway lines, it illustrates what we might
call the way that colonies economies were or turned outward as it were.
The connection between the commodity production zone and the wider world through the nexus
of the port.
This was emphasized, this becomes all important.
Now lateral connections on the other hand that might connect point to point within the
interior portions of Africa, these tend to wane, to atrophy.
The concentration comes to be on these pathways, the gateways of the ports leading to the points
of production and back again.
So colonial development tended to be highly concentrated around these zones, around the
plantation areas, around the mining areas and around these pathways between them to the
sea.
Inside those zones there's a lot of action, there's a lot of economic activity in some
real senses, there is some growth and development taking place.
And of those zones on the other hand, in the hinterlands away from them, the contrast was
plain to see and a lot of respects remains plain to see.
These hinterland areas tend to be where there is very little in the way of economic action,
where populations are dominated by the elderly, by the very young, by females, and places
where in many respects there has been a decline which has yet to be reversed.
Now all of this economic transformation that we've been discussing obviously required African
labor.
Whether this meant African farmers producing peanuts or cocoa on their own land, whether
it meant Africans working for wages under European employers on mines or on plantations, whether
indeed it meant the labor required and an enormous amount of it was required, it's fairly
obvious, to construct the infrastructure that we're talking about in the first place.
Now this raises an immediate distinction between the era for instance of the Atlantic slave
trade at least for West and West Central Africa.
Clearly African labor was absolutely critical in that period as well, but as we all know
it was labor which was forcibly transplanted and set to work, put to work on enterprises
producing wealth in a very different part of the world, the new world.
In this era on the other hand African labor is certainly equally central but will be in
situ.
It will be African labor performing that labor in Africa itself.
Now how was this labor to be obtained?
How was it to be mobilized?
The degree and longevity of direct compulsion used to obtain this labor may surprise people.
It certainly has a history that lasts well into the fifth decade of the century after
World War II.
It has a long history it turns out and it was common at varying degrees in all of the
territories in the French, the Corvée is the word that was certainly used everywhere
and often to refer to the drafting of labor.
In all the colonies colonial administrations compelled labor for their own administrative
purposes.
For instance the collection of tax often required the traveling of the European officer and
he had to be accompanied by usually a fair number of porters, persons carrying belongings
to move his camp from place to place and collect that tax.
For the infrastructure itself I'm thinking here not of the railway so much but of simply
the crude rural networks of roads.
These were maintained very often by labor that was compelled.
Now again I don't mean enslaved.
This was temporary, it was usually paid, perhaps low wages but nonetheless paid but it was
also not voluntary.
Now in some cases particularly in the early Belgian Congo and in the Portuguese colonies
the compulsion went considerably farther and the labor was assigned to various private
enterprises and private employers.
Now beyond the history of compulsion and that is certainly far from the whole story and
it's a story which declines in importance over time.
Beyond that taxation in colonial territories indirectly produced a need to earn colonial
currency.
Beyond that many worked quite voluntarily in order to obtain a whole range of new desired
goods.
Again cultures are changing here and the desire for western style clothing or the iron cookware
or eventually the battery driven radio and so forth.
The desire to invest in one's children's education, the desire to bring back resources
and invest them in the rural homestead operations, the peasant farming operations and so forth.
All of this could motivate and propel or attract a person from one of these hinterlands to
enter these zones of intensified production around the need and desire for export.
Now my reference in the last minute or so to a new range of desired goods suggests the
other side of the economic coin in the colonial period.
It was hoped that the colonies as they developed would provide markets for the manufacturers
of the metropole.
Again if the symbol of the industrial age is the factory it's not simply the raw materials
which are being sought out of Africa to put into one side or one end of the factory if
you like but new customers, new markets to take up and purchase the products which came
out of the other side.
We know this was a motivation even very early on or at least it would be one.
Let me go back to a quotation from 1878 from a figure that we met in our last lecture
and that's Henry Morton Stanley world famous of course for his finding of Livingston when
Livingston was feared to be lost but as we'll see in lecture 25 on the creation of the Belgian
Congo certainly an important player in many other respects here as well.
He gave a speech in 1878 and this is really before the scramble for Africa gets underway
to a group of businessmen in Birmingham certainly the heart of the industrial belt in Britain
and it's a speech which in a sense where Stanley who is in a sense reveling in his own fame
at this point having undertaken some considerable explorations of his own and feeling that he
in a sense was opening the gates the gateways to Africa he wanted them to get on board in
this and in this short excerpt he sort of touches all the bases that we looked at in
our analysis of the scramble for Africa the portrait of Africans as primitive the need
for redemption but binds that up with the self-interest of the manufacturers of goods
as well listen to him there are 40 million naked people beyond that gateway and the cotton
spinners of Manchester are waiting to clothe them Birmingham's foundries are glowing with
the red metal that shall presently be made into ironwork in every fashion and shape for
them and the trinkets that shall adorn those dusky bosoms and the ministers of Christ are
zealous to bring them the poor benighted heathen into the Christian fold again you get the
imagery of Africa and you get the the evangelical side of this but it's very much wrapped up
in a ball of wax that includes new markets in this in this case Stanley knew well enough
that the the great majority of Africans he encountered were were not in fact naked but
it doesn't necessarily obviate his point about selling them in this case a different kind
of clothing a different style of clothing and and so on if you could sell everybody
in Uganda or Nigeria or Senegal or the Côte d'Ivoire one pair of shoes a year or one
set of cookware a year again this did represent the tapping of a new kind of market they were
unconvinced in 1878 but a generation later they're quite convinced 1897 a columnist we
would call them today Frederick Greenwood says new markets new markets is the constant cry
of our captains of industry and merchant princes and it is well to them that the ear of government
should willingly incline it ought to do so and it does so new markets being the cry at
this point taken up not by the sort of cheerleader figures like Stanley but according to Greenwood
by the the captains of industry themselves it's nothing peculiar to colonial Africa about
this of course the founder of my beloved undergraduate alma mater James B. Duke was of course also
the founder of the American Tobacco Company and I read an account recently of how Duke
who was a very rough-hewn type essentially slumbered through a presentation on China
at the beginning of the 20th century until the presenter gave him a figure for the total
population of China at which point he sat upright and said that's where I'm gonna sell
cigarettes and he did and it was part of the the success that he had as as a businessman
well let's turn to the political commonalities in colonial Africa for for a moment politically
of course the African colonies were conquered territories this was the sort of bottom line
that distinguished them as colonial projects as opposed to imperial projects as we define
that in a previous lecture they were administered as such as conquered territories by means
which were authoritarian at the least and brutal at at the most the lines of political
command in colonial Africa ran in theory from the metropolitan capital from a London or
a Paris from a Brussels to a colonial governor almost without exception a European from the
mother country as we would expect a white governor to the the so-called district officers
also Europeans also whites presiding over the the territorial units the the provinces
the districts etc of the colonial territories now I said in theory and that is in theory
in practice a considerable amount of discretion was given to the so-called man on the spot
a phrase that you hear a lot in analyses of colonial administration in other words this
top-down model of policy being set in London and Paris transmitted to the governor's transmitted
from there to the district officers and so forth often was was honored in the the breach
the bottom line objectives of colonial administration were to maintain order above all to keep the
exports flowing and to collect the tax how exactly these were achieved was to some degree
secondary and how a particular district officer who after all was often operating in tremendous
isolation and far from the capital far from others who might oversee his particular procedures
or or innovations in order to achieve these ends again a lot of latitude allowed to to
the the man on the spot now the final guarantors of order in colonial situations as as in any
other situation where the security forces the police and the the military now these were
again almost universally commanded as we would expect by by Europeans coming from the the
metropole but the policemen themselves the ordinary soldiers the NCOs the non-commissioned
officers in the security forces were usually Africans and often selected or or recruited
for such work based upon stereotypical in some cases the conceptions about particular ethnic
groups particular so-called tribes which were said to be cut out for such work in other
words who could be trusted to be to be tough to be brutal if need be again the oldest rule
of empire probably divide in rule and if we can utilize persons from one ethnic group to
maintain order over another now so be it now it was at the level just below the the district
officer that to me things really get interesting remember that practically every colony incorporated
numerous ethnic groups and a whole panoply therefore of previously independent government
structures previously independent rulers it's a common misconception I find this at least
in my undergraduate students that with with colonial conquest that African political structures
were simply smashed in in that process this was often I would say in fact usually not
not the case they may have been defeated they may have concluded that resistance was futile
and found with themselves with little alternative but to to tender submission of one sort or
another and usually with with great bitterness and regret but nonetheless they were still
around I'm talking about African kings chiefs headman still largely around as of course
were their rivals pretenders to their to their thrones or or positions or offices and so
forth now there were some cases where authority figures were not around and that tended to
be in those stateless societies which we took a brief look at at least in lecture number
six if the oldest rule of empire is divide and rule perhaps the second oldest would be
something like this that virtually all empires find it necessary indeed find it advisable
to make use of authority figures drawn from the subject populations African empires were
no exception in this case for reasons of numbers alone again relatively few Europeans were
actually involved in the running of Europe's empires in Africa for reasons of low numbers
alone then they needed the African chiefs and I'll simply use chiefs as the the sort
of catch all term here for the kinds of authority figures drawn from the subject population that
I'm referring to they needed them to maintain this order they needed them to settle disputes
particularly minor disputes the district officers let alone those in the capital didn't want
to get involved in in minor or petty crimes or let alone in domestic disputes or what
we would call civil disagreements or or what have you if we could have that taken care
of by a pre-existing chief or king fine and of course to collect the labor to turn it
out this is another phrase from the from the old colonial period to to collect the taxes
there came to be a dependence upon the African chief the African authority figure to assist
at the least and to carry that out at the most now although the British made a virtue
out of this necessity and eventually a sort of fetish about propping up the indigenous
authorities through their policy of indirect rule and I'm going to say more about that
next time because it is a difference in the flavor between British colonial administration
and the others nonetheless all of the empires in Africa were to a larger or or smaller degree
in the same boat the African chief then or move up the scale the African king or bit
down the scale the African headman then found himself in a delicate man in the middle position
under colonial rule his followers expected him to if he had any claim to legitimacy or
respect to essentially voice their own concerns to the authority structure higher up whether
it was the taxation is too great a burden or we've been giving up too many young men for
for for forced labor or or what have you they expected their chief or their king to articulate
these grievances to the the colonial rulers but of course the rulers had their own expectations
as we have seen they expected the chief's assistance in carrying out these critical colonial
mandates of keeping peace collecting taxes recruiting labor and settling disputes now
if you do the first job too well the first job is to articulate the grievances of your
own followers if you do that job too well you run the risk of being replaced by someone
frankly whom the authorities find more cooperative if you do the second job on the other hand
too well and become an all too efficient or valuable assistance in the carrying out of
these colonial mandates you run another kind of risk and that is a thorough alienation
from the very people whom you are in in theory the the ruler over at least the ruler of of
indigenous record over and you risk being labeled a sellout a stooge and rejected by
your own people this actually carries forward with some interesting implications into the
nationalist movements and the nationalist era which we which we look at quite soon in
the course because this position of being on the fence and the position the risks of
falling if one leans too far one way or another while on the fence of course increases in
its delicacy as we get into the nationalist era where nationalists are seeking the support
of chiefs in their own anti-colonial agenda and we see that some chiefs wind up being
celebrated as sort of heroes of the nationalist movements and others indeed denounced in some
cases attacked or even assassinated okay the African chief under colonial rule we spoken
then of economic and political commonalities which I think span and embrace the experience
the colonial experience across most are all of the the empires in Africa let's turn to
the cultural side culturally colonial rule meant of course the institutionalization of
notions of white supremacy and of European culture as the model for civilization this
in turn meant that Western style education and here we can make another generalization
this was dominated in virtually every territory for most of the first half of the 20th century
by Christian missionary activities by Christian missionary societies and operations that Western
style education was the key to the limited advancement available to Africans in the colonial
system and by that advancement I mean the possibility of becoming for instance a clerk
was a word that you hear a lot in the colonial period you know the educated clerk the person
who was literate could work you know could do the accounts for a district officer for
instance as an assistant or in a court as a court reporter as a shop assistant a person
carrying out the business of a merchant and let us not forget that of course Africans
by the thousands become teachers themselves they become clergymen and in some cases clergywomen
themselves and a key to any of these kinds of relative advancement is of course Western
style education now a vast literature has developed which includes many distinguished novels and
stories and films and so on which plums the psychological and social implications of
these new realities of the Western model of what it meant at a human and psychological
level to be ruled by outsiders and you know when we look at the novels of Ngugi from Kenya
or or of a Chibi or Soyinka from Nigeria or Senghor from Senegal we're looking at people
who wrestle us in some ways you could almost say that dealing with the realities of colonial
rule in the most basic sense constitutes the great theme of 20th century African literature
now Africans responses which you can again see so many variations in these works of art
to the new realities ran a huge and complex range from embarrassing imitation and emulation
on one side to to outright rejection of the Western model and rebellion on the other in
between a great many people and I mean ordinary people in colonial situations trod an uneasy
ground of ambivalence ambiguity mixed emotions of syncretism of the mixing of of cultural
traditions both indigenous and imported we can close though with one observation which
foreshadows our later look at African nationalism many of those who led the anti-colonial revolt
were in fact those who had gone farthest in systems of Western education we'll revisit
that point in a lecture or two so we have described today then some commonalities of
colonial systems in our next lecture we will turn to some differences between colonial
empires in Africa and how some of them at least change considerably over time thank you.
