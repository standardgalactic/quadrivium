üîç Your question:  What are the basic principles of magnetism in physics?

ü§ñ Answer:
  The basic principles of magnetism in physics include:

1. Electromagnetism: Magnetism is a result of the movement of electric charges. This relationship between electricity and magnetism is described by Maxwell's equations.

2. Magnetic Field: A magnetic field is a region around a magnet or moving electric charge where its force can be detected. It is typically represented by B (for magnetic flux density).

3. Right-Hand Rule: The right-hand rule is a way to determine the direction of the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire. If you extend your thumb, index finger, and middle finger of your right hand so that they are mutually perpendicular, wrapping the wire around the thumb represents the direction of the current, and the direction of the magnetic field is from the index finger to the middle finger.

4. Magnetic Domains: In ferromagnetic materials, atoms align themselves into small regions called domains. When a magnet is made or demagnetized, it is by aligning these domains in a single direction.

5. Magnetic Field Lines: Magnetic field lines are imaginary lines drawn to represent the magnetic field. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is tangent to the field line at that point.

6. Ampere's Law: Ampere's law describes how a magnetic field can be generated by an electric current, and it is one of Maxwell's equations.

7. Gauss' Law for Magnetism: Gauss' law for magnetism states that the total magnetic flux through any closed surface is always zero if there are no magnetic charges (monopoles) enclosed by the surface. This law helps explain why there are no isolated north or south poles in ferromagnets.

8. Ferromagnetism: Ferromagnetism is the type of magnetism that occurs in certain materials, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, at temperatures below their Curie points. In these materials, atomic magnetic domains align themselves to create a net macroscopic magnetic moment.

9. Diamagnetism: Diamagnetism is the weak magnetic response exhibited by most substances when they are placed in an external magnetic field. It is due to the induced currents in the material caused by the magnetic field.

10. Paramagnetism: Paramagnetism is a type of magnetism that occurs in certain substances, such as oxygen and aluminum, where the atoms have unpaired electrons. In an external magnetic field, these electrons align themselves parallel to the field, creating a weak magnetic moment.

These principles provide the foundation for understanding various aspects of magnetism, including the behavior of magnets, the interaction between electric currents and magnetic fields, and the properties of ferromagnetic, diamagnetic, and paramagnetic materials.

Well, Hazlett's book is full of homely examples as he tries to explain moving from the micro

He then followed this observation with a credo that sounds both modern and right
some 90 years after he wrote it, quote,
nothing is more preposterous therefore than that an author,
the organization of whose temporal impressions is confessedly vague,
do I hear a faint hint here of I can't dance,
should undertake to present to humanity at large...

about that which is not known. Indeed, some similes are already well on their way beyond
comparison and into speculation. As we can see in this passage from John Updike's well-known
short story, A&P, where the protagonist, Sammy, is describing a striking young girl in a
bathing suit who, along with two friends, has just entered the grocery store where he's
checking her. Quote, she didn't look around, not this queen. She just walked straight on...

Three, other criticisms one must meet by considering a language of the poet.
One, by the assumption of a strange word in a passage like Ureas Men Proton, whereby Ureas, homo, may perhaps mean not mules but sentinels,
and in saying of Dolon,
Os re toi aidos men aene cacos, is meaning may perhaps be not that Dolon's body was deformed,
but that his face was ugly, as why days is the Cretan work a handsome face....
