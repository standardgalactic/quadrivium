Lecture 4 – The First Amendment and Corporate Speech
Money talks, but is it speech?
And if it is speech, is it protected by the First Amendment?
The question of whether money is speech raises a great many other questions, not only about
what speech is, and when and why it might be regulated, but also, and perhaps even more
fundamentally, about who can speak.
To put the matter as succinctly as possible, do corporations have speech rights?
Should the Constitution protect what many of us call commercial speech?
One might imagine two different versions of this question.
First, is the money that corporations spend in advertising their products or businesses
speech?
Could we conclude that corporations have a First Amendment right to provide some sorts
of commercial information to consumers?
Does it matter if the advertisement promises to restore my youth, to keep me skinny, to
make me funny and wealthy and just generally to make me irresistible to others?
Are ads protected by the First Amendment?
Second, consider the money spent by corporations and unions in political campaigns.
Are these monetary expenditures a form of political expression that should be protected,
even though the speaker in such cases is not a person or a citizen in the ordinary sense
of the term?
Should corporations and unions have a First Amendment right to comment on, and perhaps
to influence, public affairs?
These questions concerning who can speak and about what necessarily take us back to First
Principles, a point I want to stress throughout this lecture.
To begin though, consider this.
If the purpose of the First Amendment generally is to facilitate self-governance, if the point
is to make representative democracy possible, then could we argue that citizens and only
citizens should be entitled to First Amendment protection?
At its simplest level, we might argue that government of the people, by the people, for
the people, to borrow Lincoln's phrase, should mean that the people and the people alone
possess First Amendment freedoms.
On the other hand, isn't it just as easy to argue that what the First Amendment demands
is not participation, but information?
That what the First Amendment ought to protect should extend to any information that contributes
in some meaningful way to political dialogue, whatever the source may be.
In this formulation, what matters is the character of the information of the speech,
not the identity of the speaker.
Of course, embracing this particular approach to the First Amendment, the self-governance
approach we identified in Lecture 1, does not fully address all of the questions we
raised earlier.
Such an approach might tell us that corporations should indeed have the right to comment on
matters of public interest, or perhaps to comment in the marketplace of politics, but
it doesn't seem to yield the First Amendment right to advertise in the marketplace of commerce.
Do we need a different theory of the First Amendment to get there?
Again, recalling our discussion in Lecture 1, would an understanding of the First Amendment
as facilitating self-development or human flourishing suffice for this purpose?
How often does commercial speech promise to make our lives better or easier, or to make
us happier or more fulfilled as human beings?
Be honest, isn't your home full of things you didn't know you needed or wanted, but
which, now that you own them, brings you a secret or a guilty joy?
I have a battery-powered pepper grinder that I cannot live without.
For many years, the court afforded little or no protection to corporate speech, whether
directed to commerce or to public affairs.
Like some other categories of speech that we will take up in subsequent lectures, such
as fighting words and pornography, the court simply assumed that commercial speech, although
it is certainly expression of a sort, fell outside the protections of the First Amendment.
The point was so obvious that it needed no justification or explanation.
So in a case called Valentine v. Christensen, decided in 1942, Justice Roberts, writing
for the court, concluded, and I quote, the Constitution imposes no restraint on government
as respects purely commercial advertising.
Unfortunately, the Christensen decision neither defined commercial speech nor explained why
it fell outside of the First Amendment.
The definitional problem, as it seems to be in most cases involving the First Amendment,
is significant.
You may remember, for example, that in New York Times v. Sullivan, decided in 1964,
the court erected a shield for the media in defamation cases involving public officials.
The speech in that case was a full-page ad, a solicitation for contributions.
Does that suggest that we ought to distinguish between commercial speech that hawks a product,
or a service, and commercial speech that addresses a matter of public concern?
Alternatively, does it suggest that we should distinguish between the speech rights of different
kinds of corporate actors, perhaps between media and non-media corporations?
As we'll see, the distinction between media and non-media corporations has troubled the
court on occasion.
Notwithstanding Sullivan, from the 1940s through the 1960s, the court's general approach to
commercial speech cases was best represented by cases like Crestenson.
But the categorical exclusion of commercial speech when the First Amendment began to
change in the 1970s.
Crucially, at that point, the court began to formulate a more precise definition of
the term commercial speech.
In the important case of Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. the Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council Incorporated, decided in 1976, the court defined commercial speech as speech,
and I quote, that proposes a commercial transaction.
Four years later, in Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation v. the Public Service
Commission of New York, the court expanded this definition to include, and again I quote,
expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.
It is worth noting what is not included in either of these definitions of commercial
speech, namely, any speech by corporate actors that addresses public affairs.
The Virginia Pharmacy case is also important because in it the court appeared to rethink
the very idea that commercial speech was entitled to no protection.
At issue was a statute that prohibited pharmacists from advertising the price of prescription
drugs, which was challenged by a consumer's group.
In his opinion for the majority, Justice Blackman flatly rejected the idea that the
Constitution provides no protection for commercial speech.
I want first to note how the court described the speech in this case.
Quoting Justice Blackman, our pharmacist does not wish to editorialize on any subject cultural,
philosophical or political.
He does not wish to report any particularly newsworthy fact or to make generalized observations
even about commercial matters.
The idea he wishes to communicate is simply this, I will sell you the X prescription drug
at the Y price.
Our question then is whether this communication is wholly outside the protection of the First
Amendment.
The court's clear answer to that last question was no.
Commercial speech is not, the court now concluded, wholly outside the First Amendment.
Our question must be, why did the court reach that conclusion?
Although the court approached this question from a couple of different directions, the
essential answer is this.
The court was persuaded that the interests of consumers in the free flow of information
entitled the information, in this case in the form of an advertisement, to some degree
of constitutional protection.
Indeed, the court observed that the consumer's interest in such information, and I quote,
may be as keen, if not keener by far, than is interest in the day's most urgent political
debate.
The court thus concluded that making such information available provided a collective
public benefit.
The free flow of commercial information is in the public interest, according to the court.
Because it helps citizens make well informed decisions.
In part, this is why the court rejected the claim that commercial speech, like other sorts
of speech that are categorically excluded from the First Amendment, such as pornography
or fighting words, categories of speech that we'll take up in later lectures, can be prohibited.
Of course, the court's decision that commercial speech warrants some measure of protection
under the First Amendment does not mean that such speech is always protected.
The court concluded that some forms of commercial speech regulation are obviously permissible.
Among these would be reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, so long as they are
justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.
As long as they also serve a significant governmental interest and leave open, ample alternative
channels for the communication of the information.
The current framework for assessing state regulations on commercial speech is set forth
in the central Hudson case I mentioned a moment ago.
Decided in 1980, this case involved the challenge to a ban on advertising by electric utility
companies.
In brief, the test, like the O'Brien test we considered for symbolic speech in lecture
two, has four parts.
First, we ask if the speech is misleading or involves illegal activity.
If it is false, misleading, or does involve illegal activity, then it has no informational
value and is unprotected.
Second, the governmental interest advanced by the regulation or limitation must be substantial.
Third, the regulation must directly advance that interest.
And fourth, the regulation must not be more extensive than is necessary to advance the
state's interest.
If we had more time, it might be fun to consider how the test actually works in practice, and
there are lots of cases where the court has tried to apply it.
So, just quickly, would the central Hudson test permit a state to ban advertisements
concerning the price of alcohol except at the place of sale?
The court addressed this question in 44 Liquor Mart, Incorporated, vs. Rhode Island, decided
in 1996, finding that the ban did not survive the test.
The case is especially interesting for the concurring opinion by Justice Thomas, who
wrote and I quote, I do not see a philosophical or historical basis for asserting that commercial
speech is of lower value than non-commercial speech.
Indeed, some historical materials suggest the contrary.
The central Hudson test, you will likely have noticed, is not quite as protective as the
test the court uses for some other kinds of speech, especially speech that is political.
Why?
The court in the Virginia Pharmacy case answered this question by pointing to what it called
common sense differences between commercial and other kinds of speech.
One such difference, according to the court, is that commercial advertisements typically
make claims that are easier to verify.
The court also concluded that commercial speech may be more durable, hardier, and more objective
than other kinds of speech, and is therefore less subject to being chilled by state regulation.
So commercial speech is entitled to some degree of First Amendment protection because it has
some kind of social or public value.
As we'll see when we take up the topics of obscenity in fighting words, the court has
often concluded that these kinds of speech are not protected by the First Amendment precisely
because they do not have a similar kind of value.
I wonder, though, if this sort of logic isn't a little one-sided.
Why shouldn't we ask what kind of value the speech possesses?
If its value is tied to commerce, for instance, then have we implicitly decided that one of
the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect expression that is not strictly necessary
for democratic self-governments?
And related, shouldn't we be entitled to ask if the value of the expression in question
is outweighed by its deleterious effects?
Shouldn't we ask if protecting commercial speech harms other collective values, perhaps
by contributing to a mindless material culture that actually stunts our growth as human creatures?
Similarly, the court noted that state regulations designed to ensure the accuracy or truthfulness
of commercial speech might well be permissible because, in the court's words, the First
Amendment, as we construe it today, does not prohibit the state from ensuring that the
stream of commercial information flows cleanly as well as freely.
So commercial speech that is false, deceptive, or misleading has no claim to protection under
the First Amendment.
Here how this rule compares to the rule in New York Times versus Sullivan.
You'll recall that in Sullivan, the court crafted the actual malice standard precisely
because it thought freedom of political speech required a rule that does not penalize speech
that is false and even misleading.
One final point about the Virginia Pharmacy case.
At my university, there is an annual lecture series named after Justice Hugo Black that
invites important public figures and academics to give public talks about the meaning of
the First Amendment.
Some years ago, Justice Blackman gave the Black Lecture.
In response to a question from the audience about what he was most proud of during his
tenure on the court, the Justice responded that he was very proud of his contribution
in making commercial speech a candidate for protection by the First Amendment.
Frankly I was a little surprised by that answer.
So far we've been considering commercial speech from the standpoint of its use to promote
economic transactions.
But as I mentioned at the beginning of this lecture, we might also approach the category
of commercial speech as a question that concerns the identity of the speaker.
Should corporations and unions and other sorts of groups and associations be permitted
under the First Amendment to comment on matters that concern public affairs?
Many of you are likely to think of the court's important decision in Citizens United versus
FEC decided in 2010 and that is an important case for us to talk about.
But the issue of corporate speech that does not involve advertising arose long before
Citizens United.
For example, in Buckley versus Vallejo, decided in 1976, the court considered the constitutionality
of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, in which Congress had established certain
campaign spending limits on candidates and political groups, including limits on the
personal funds candidates could expend on their own elections.
The Act also included disclosure requirements for campaign contributions and expenditures.
The ruling in Buckley was complicated.
The court held that the restrictions on individual contributions to political campaigns and candidates
did not violate the First Amendment because they helped to guarantee, quote, the integrity
of our system of representative democracy.
On the other hand, the court found that the Act's restrictions on independent expenditures,
only spent by someone other than the candidate in campaigns, as well as the limits on expenditures
by candidates from their own personal or family resources, did violate the First Amendment.
Although the court's percurium opinion addresses several issues and prompted several concurring
and dissenting opinions, the logic behind the conclusion is fairly straightforward.
In the court's analysis, spending money in an election is constitutionally protected
speech.
In reaching this conclusion, the court rejected the claim by Congress and I quote, that what
the Act regulates is conduct and that its effect on speech and association is incidental
at most.
Instead, the court argued, and here I need to quote the court at some length, a restriction
on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during
a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of
issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.
This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the
expenditure of money.
The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for
news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments
of effective political speech.
Buckley versus Vallejo did not involve commercial speech directly, but it concluded that spending
money in an election is a form of constitutionally protected speech.
This conclusion hinged crucially on the idea that the First Amendment's protections
attached to the character of the speech in question and not on the identity of the speaker.
In another early case, First National Bank of Boston versus Bellotti decided in 1978
a sharply divided court voted five to four to strike a state statute that outlawed corporations
from spending money in a state referendum unless the referendum materially affected the corporation.
An additional provision erected a complete bar to corporate expenditures on issues involving
the state's income or property taxes.
Justice Powell's opinion for the court focused not upon the identity of the speaker, but rather
on the character of the prohibited speech.
Noting that the speech touched directly upon matters of public import and thus constituted
high value political speech, the court applied the strict scrutiny test.
At this point, however, the court did have to acknowledge that the speakers targeted
by the state law were corporations.
This was because in support of its statute, the state of Massachusetts advanced as compelling
its interest in ensuring that corporate spending would not diminish, quote, the active role
of the individual citizen in the electoral process.
It is easy to understand the state's fear here.
Corporations may have access to wealth and resources so substantial that their voice
may simply drown out other voices and especially the voices of individual citizens.
This argument is sometimes known as the equalization or anti-distortion rationale because it holds
that the state has an interest in making sure that some voices do not distort the electoral
process by virtue of superior resources.
The equalization rationale is not very far removed from a point we made earlier in this
lecture.
If the purpose of the First Amendment generally is to facilitate self-governance, then we
might conclude that citizens and only citizens should be entitled to First Amendment protections.
The court in Bellotti struck the statute, so we might conclude that the court was not
much persuaded by this argument.
But many scholars argue that Bellotti was not quite so dismissive about the equalization
argument largely because the state had not actually advanced any evidence to support
its suggestion that corporate voices dominated public discourse.
Furthermore, in their dissent, four justices had little difficulty concluding that the corporate
speech in question might, quote, be viewed as seriously threatening the role of the First
Amendment as a guarantor of a free marketplace of ideas.
In a subsequent case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce decided in 1990 the court appell
the state statute that imposed limitations on corporate spending in elections, noting
that the statute did burden First Amendment freedoms, but that this burden was justified
because the statute advanced a compelling interest.
The majority, led by Justice Marshall, accepted the state's goal of preventing corruption
or the appearance of corruption in the political arena by reducing the threat that corporate
wealth would be used to influence election outcomes unfairly.
In a sharply worded dissent, in which he called the logic of the majority's opinion Orwellian,
Justice Scalia wrote, and I quote, the premise of our system is that there is no such thing
as too much speech, that the people are not foolish but intelligent and will separate the
wheat from the chaff.
As conceded in Lincoln's aphorism about fooling all of the people some of the time, that premise
will not invariably accord with reality.
But it will assuredly do so much more frequently than the premise that the court today embraces,
that a healthy democratic system can survive the legislative power to prescribe how much
political speech is too much, who may speak and who may not.
Perhaps the most important, and certainly the best known decision on corporate speech
is the case of Citizens United versus the Federal Election Commission, decided in 2010.
Citizens United concerned the constitutionality of a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign
Reform Act of 2002, better known as the McCain Fine Gold Act, that prohibited unions, corporations,
and not-for-profit organizations from broadcasting certain kinds of election communications, broadcast
advertisements mentioning a candidate, for example, within 30 days before a primary or
60 days before a general election.
In 2004, Citizens United filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, charging
that filmmaker Michael Moore's movie Fahrenheit 9-11 was a kind of prohibited political advertising
within the time limits established by McCain Fine Gold.
The FEC dismissed the complaint.
Thereafter, Citizens United began itself to produce a series of documentary films.
One of these films was entitled Hillary, the Movie, which was critical of Hillary Clinton,
then a candidate for the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency.
The movie was a 90-minute documentary released for the big screen and on DVD.
Citizens United also hoped to make the film available for free through video on demand
services.
A district court ruled that Citizens United's plans to air the documentary violated the
McCain Fine Gold Act, and the case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court.
At its simplest level, Citizens United stands for a single proposition.
The government may not restrict corporations and unions from spending money in political
campaigns because these expenditures are speech protected by the First Amendment.
As a consequence, the provisions in the McCain Fine Gold Act that restricted certain kinds
of election communications within 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general
election were unconstitutional.
On the other hand, and many folks don't seem to know this, Citizens United did not address
the federal ban on direct contributions from corporations or unions to candidate campaigns
or political parties, which remain illegal in races for federal office.
The majority opinion for the court was written by Justice Kennedy.
Justice Kennedy addressed many of the issues we have considered, such as whether the First
Amendment's protections for speech depend in any way upon the identity of the speaker,
and whether the possibility that corporations might drown out other voices with their vast
resources is reason enough to limit speech.
In ruling that restrictions on campaign communications by corporations and unions were a violation
of the First Amendment, the court explicitly overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce.
You'll recall that in Austin, the court had upheld a state law that prohibited corporations
from using money to support or oppose candidates.
As a result, the Citizens United decision permits corporations and unions to spend money both
on electioneering communications and to campaign directly for candidates they support or oppose.
The court did not, however, address the question of whether they can contribute directly to
candidates or political parties.
Now, apart from its status as a landmark case, I want to note that Citizens United is also
a very useful primer on some of the things we have learned in this course so far.
The court begins its analysis of the speech claims in Citizens United by noting that the
Constitution protects speech because, in the court's words, speech is an essential mechanism
of democracy for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people.
The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach
consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it.
The First Amendment has its fullest and most urgent application to speech uttered during
a campaign for political office.
The majority argued that independent expenditures are a form of speech and limiting a corporation's
ability to spend money also limits its ability to speak.
Moreover, spending money in an election or a campaign is not just speech, it is political speech.
What do we know about political speech?
Political speech we have learned is high value speech and thus entitled to the highest
degree of protection.
To quote again from the majority opinion,
Laws that burden political speech are subject to strict scrutiny which requires the government
to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve
that interest.
The court likewise noted that as a general proposition, the state may not suppress speech
based on the viewpoint of the speaker.
This last point should sound familiar, but its application to speech in Citizens United
may not seem immediately obvious.
The statutory restrictions at issue, limits on certain campaign communications within
a certain period of time before elections, do not obviously suggest a purpose to silence
particular points of view.
But here is the court's take on the issue and again I think it is important to use
the court's own words.
Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands against attempts
to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints.
Prohibited to are restrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by
some but not others.
As instruments to censor, these categories are interrelated.
Speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply a means
to control content.
Do you see the connection?
In the court's view, the distinction between silencing speech and silencing certain speakers
is too facile.
What sometimes look like restrictions grounded in identity are really a kind of viewpoint
discrimination and viewpoint discrimination is generally disfavored constitutionally.
Perhaps just as importantly, Justice Kennedy argued, and again I simply have to quote the
court, that by taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others, the government
deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish
worth, standing, and respect for the speaker's voice.
This quote intrigues me.
Words like worth, standing, and respect for the speaker's voice seem to me to remind us
that our commitment to the First Amendment rests not only on the importance speech has
for self-government, but also for its importance for flourishing and dignity.
But I wonder too, does it make any sense to talk about those terms when the speaker is
an artificial entity, a corporation or a union, and not a living, breathing person?
Justice Kennedy also identified another reason why the government ought not to have authority
to restrict speech based on the identity of the speaker.
Such restrictions, he argued, deny the public its right and privilege to determine for itself
what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration.
In the words of the court, when government seeks to use its full power, including the
criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information, or what distrusted
source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought.
This is unlawful.
The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.
In these words, perhaps you can hear the echo of Justice Scalia's dissent in Austin versus
Michigan Chamber of Commerce.
On the speech versus identity issue then, the court concluded that the First Amendment
has as its object the protection of speech, not the protection of speech that can be attributed
to a particular class of citizens.
Because corporations are groups of individuals, they must receive the same free speech privileges
as individual citizens.
As a quick aside, as I was editing this lecture, I saw in the morning's news a report that
Justice Stevens, now retired, criticized the court on this very point, saying that the
court eventually will have to confront the question of whether the ruling in Citizens
United applies also to the ability of foreign corporations and potentially even terrorist
groups to spend money freely.
He predicted that the Justices would decide that it does not, quoting Justice Stevens.
The court must then explain its abandonment of, or at least qualify its reliance upon,
the proposition that the identity of the speaker is an impermissible basis for regulating campaign
speech.
It will be necessary to explain why the First Amendment provides greater protection for
some non-voters than for other non-voters.
So far, our consideration of Citizens United has proceeded at a fairly high level of abstraction.
But the opinion had much to say also about how the restrictions in McCain Fine Gold would
work in the real world, too.
Just as Kennedy noted that since the First Amendment does not distinguish between the
media and other sorts of corporations, the acts restrictions would allow Congress to
suppress political speech in newspapers, books, television, and even blogs, or indeed
in almost any kind of media.
True, McCain Fine Gold itself included an exception for media corporations.
But the court was not persuaded, observing that there was simply no precedent to support
a distinction between corporations which are exempt as media corporations and those which
are not.
The court said, and I quote,
"'We have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional
privilege beyond that of other speakers.'"
Whether the press has or should have any special protection under the First Amendment is a topic
we'll take up later in Lecture 8.
Moreover, the court noted that with the advent of the internet and the decline of print and
broadcast media, the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political
and social issues has become far more blurred.
Now, I've said earlier that Citizens United is an occasion to think about what we've learned
about the First Amendment so far.
Another thing we've learned is that even high value political speech may sometimes be limited
or regulated by the state, especially if the state can advance it at a compelling state
interest that justifies restrictions that are narrowly tailored.
This raises a second question in Citizens United.
Is the possibility that corporations might drown out other voices with their vast resources
reason enough to limit speech?
Is that a compelling state interest?
You'll recall that we spoke earlier about this in terms of equalization or as an anti-distortion
rationale for limiting speech.
The court dismissed the anti-distortion interest in Citizens United with little discussion,
in part because the government itself did not press the claim.
It is important, therefore, to be precise about the purported state interest in Citizens United.
We might describe the state's interest as preventing favoritism or the appearance of
favoritism generated by corporate money flowing to campaigns and the consequent effect that
citizens might lose confidence in the ability or capacity of elected officials to govern
impartially or in the public interest.
The court's response to this concern is illuminating.
Justice Kennedy said simply, and I quote,
�The appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our
democracy.
The fact that a corporation or any other speaker is willing to spend money to try to persuade
voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials.�
This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse to take part in
democratic governance because of additional political speech made by a corporation or
any other speaker.
On this point, Justice Stevens, writing for himself and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer and
Sotomayor, replied that the court's ruling and a quote threatens to undermine the integrity
of elected institutions across the nation.
And he continued, �A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe
laws are being bought and sold.�
If I may interject, I wonder precisely how it is that the majority knows that the appearance
of influence will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.
What evidence does the court have at its disposal that would lead it to announce such a conclusion
so confidently?
The court did note that it could find very little direct evidence of votes being traded
for contributions, but doesn't that ask the question too narrowly?
And in the same vein, what makes Justice Stevens so sure that the confidence of the people
in the integrity of the electoral process will be damaged irreparably?
Stevens predicted that if the public believes that corporations dominate elections, disaffected
voters will stop participating, citing recent data indicating that 80% of the public view
corporate independent expenditures as a method used to gain unfair legislative access.
But how much confidence can we have in this kind of survey data?
Here perhaps is a better, more focused version of the same question, one that applies to
the majority and to the dissenters with equal force.
Why is the court better suited to make this judgment than the political branches?
After all, one might conclude that congressional representatives and presidents, by virtue
of their vast everyday experience in running campaigns and raising money to run them, are
in the best position to assess whether corporate money is a systemic or institutional problem.
Or should we say instead that it is precisely the isolation and the aloofness of judges
from the sullied life of politics that makes them best suited to judge whether money corrupts?
The court in Citizens United also considered whether there is a compelling state interest
in protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political
speech.
The court rejected this claim for a number of reasons, noting for instance that in its
view there was little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders through
the procedures of corporate democracy itself.
Moreover, if Congress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would
not have banned corporate speech in only certain media within 30 or 60 days before an election.
A dissenting shareholders' interest would be implicated by speech in any media at any
time.
Finally, the court observed that this asserted interest, like Austin's anti-distortion rationale,
would effectively allow the government to ban the political speech even of media corporations.
What should we make of Citizens United?
It is undeniable that one effect of the decision has been to greatly increase corporate and
union spending in elections.
The relative merits of that I leave you to judge.
But as you work your way through the issues, I urge you not to forget the fundamental questions
we've covered in this lecture.
Should spending money be protected as speech under the First Amendment?
Does the answer depend on what purposes we think the First Amendment is meant to serve?
Does it matter if the expression in question is commercial or political in character?
Does the answer depend upon the character of the speech or on the identity of the speaker?
What state interests, if any, might justify restrictions on corporate or commercial speech?
And as you ponder those fundamental questions, here's one final related question that might
be food for thought.
If corporations have speech rights under the First Amendment, should they have other constitutional
rights as well?
The court has addressed this question on a number of occasions, but has yet to come
to a comprehensive position.
In Dartmouth College versus Woodward, decided in 1819, for example, the court recognized
that corporations like persons have a right to contract under the property clauses of
the Constitution.
And in another case, Santa Clara County versus Southern Pacific Railroad, decided in 1886
the court noted that corporations are persons under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th
Amendment.
But more generally, the question remains unresolved.
In sum, in this lecture we have learned that the question is not whether money talks, but
whether it is speech.
In the answer, at least according to the Supreme Court, is that sometimes the expenditure
of money is protected as speech, in part because the information it conveys can help consumers
and voters to come to informed decision about those matters.
This leads to several related issues.
Are some things that seem like speech, in fact not considered expression under the First
Amendment, perhaps because they don't convey useful information?
That's the topic we'll take up in our next lecture.
