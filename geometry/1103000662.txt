1.1 An introduction to IT
(Information Technology)
Information Technology has great 
influence on all aspects of life. Almost 
all work places and living environments 
are being computerized and the use 
of Information Technology is being 
enhanced.
Definition of Information Technology :
"IT 
(Information 
Technology) 
encompasses all of the technologies that 
we use in order to create, collect, process, 
protect and store information. It refers to 
hardware, software (computer programs), 
and computer networks". 
ICT (Information and Communication 
Technology) concept involves transfer 
and use of all kinds of information. ICT 
is the foundation of economy and a 
driving force of social changes in the 21st 
century. Distance is no longer an issue 
when it comes to accessing information; 
for example, work-from-home, distance 
learning, e-banking, and e-governance 
are now possible from any place with 
an internet connection and a computing 
device. Lets first perceive two important 
concepts - Data and Information : 
1.2 Data and Information
It is being said that the terms "data" 
and "information" are interchangeable 
and mean the same thing. However, they 
are not same and there is a difference 
between the two words. Data can be any 
character, text, word, number or raw facts. 
However, Information is data formatted 
in a manner that allows it to be utilized by 
human beings in some significant way. In 
the above example, the data appears to 
be a set of random words and numbers. 
However, when that data is interpreted, 
organized and formatted, one can tell 
that it is contact information of a person 
named as XYZ. 

2
Fig : 1 Computer System and Peripherals
Need of information : Information is 
required to take short term and long term
decisions and also to make strategic 
decisions in an organization. Since we 
live in the "Information age", Information 
Technology has become a part of our 
everyday life.
1.3 Various concepts used under IT
Before getting started let us learn 
some of the important concepts used 
under Information Technology : 
1.3.1 Computer : The word Computer is 
derived from a Latin word "computare" 
which means to "to calculate", "to count", 
"to sum up" or "to think together". An 
electronic device which accepts input 
from the user, processes it according to 
the instructions given to it and gives the 
required result in the form of output, is a 
computer.
Computer System : 
A computer can process data, images, 
audio, video and graphics. A computer 
performs five major computer operations 
or functions irrespective of their size and 
make. These are -
1)	 It accepts data or instructions by way 
of input. 
2) 	It stores data.
3) 	It can process data as required by the 
user.
4)	 It gives results in the form of output.
5) 	It controls all operations inside a 
computer.
1.3.2 Architecture of Computer : 
Computer Architecture is a specification 
detailing of how a set of software and 
hardware technology standards interact 
to form a computer system. In short, com­
puter architecture refers to how a comput­
er system is designed and how it works.
SPEAKERS

Data
Data Flow
Control Flow
Every computer system has the following
three basic components :
1. Input Unit 
2. Central Processing Unit
3. Output Unit
1. Input Unit : This unit helps users to 
enter data and commands into a computer 
system. Data can be in the form of 
numbers, words, actions, commands, etc. 
The main function of input devices is to 
direct commands and data into computer. 
Computer then uses its CPU to process 
data and produce output. 
	
For example, a keyboard is an 
input device that enters numbers and 
characters. Similarly, even a mouse can 
be an input device for entering directions 
and commands. Other examples include 
barcode reader, Magnetic Ink Character 
Recognition (MICR), Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR), etc.
Another example of input devices 
is touch-screens. Users can simply 
touch these screens without using any 
other device to enter commands. From 
smartphones to ATM machines, these 
input devices are becoming very popular 
now a days.
2. Central Processing Unit (CPU) : 
After receiving data and commands from 
users, a computer system has to process 
it according to the instructions provided. 
Here, it has to rely on a component called 
the Central Processing Unit. The CPU 
further uses these three elements :
	
a) Arithmetic and Logic Unit : 
This part of the CPU performs 
arithmetic operations. It does basic 
mathematical calculations like 
addition, subtraction, division, 
multiplication, etc. Further, it can

even perform logical functions 
like the comparison of data.
	
b) 	Control Unit :  This unit is the back
bone of computers. It is responsible 
for coordinating tasks between all 
components of a computer system. 
The control unit collects data 
from input units and sends it to 
processing units depending on its 
nature. Finally, it further transmits 
processed data to output units to 
facilitate users.
	
c) 	Memory Unit : Once a user 
enters data using input devices, 
the computer system stores this 
data in its memory unit. This data 
will now remain here until other 
components of CPU process it. 
The memory unit uses a set of 
pre-programmed instructions to 
further transmit this data to other 
parts of the CPU.
Types of Memory- There are two types
of memory
1) Primary Memory  2) Secondary Memory
1) 	Primary Memory : Primary memory 
is internal memory of the computer. 
It is also known as main memory. 
Primary Memory holds the data and 
instruction on which computer is 
currently working.
Types of Primary Memory- Primary 
memory is generally of two types.
1. RAM    2. ROM
	
1. 	 RAM 
(Random 
Access 
Memory): It stands for Random 
Access Memory. RAM is known as 
read /write memory. It is generally 
referred to as main memory of the 
computer system. It is a temporary 
memory. The information stored in 
this memory is lost as the power 
supply to the computer is switched 
off. That's why RAM is also called 
as "Volatile Memory".
	
2. 	 ROM (Read Only Memory) : It 
stands for Read Only Memory. 
ROM is a Permanent Type 
memory. The content is not lost 
when power supply is switched 
off. Content of ROM is decided by 
the computer manufacturer and 
permanently stored at the time 
of manufacturing. ROM cannot 
be overwritten by the computer. 
It is also called "Non-Volatile 
Memory".
2) Secondary Memory : It is an external 
memory of the computer. It is used 
to store the huge amount of different 
programs and information.
The secondary storage devices are :
	
1. 	Magnetic (Hard) Disk
	
2. 	Magnetic Tapes
	
3. 	Pen Drive
	
4. 	Flash memory
	
5. 	Optical Disk (CD,DVD)
	
6. 	SSD etc.

5
3. Output Unit : The third and final 
component of a computer system is 
the output unit. After processing of 
data, it is converted into a format 
which human can understand. After 
conversion, the output unit displays 
this data to users. Examples of output 
devices include monitors, screens, 
printers and speakers etc. Thus, output 
units basically reproduce the data 
formatted by the computer for user's 
benefit.

  	Try to find out names of the modern 
input devices used in shops/malls. 
1.3.3 Units of Memory : Computer 
storage and memory is often measured in 
Megabytes (MB) and Gigabytes (GB). Let 
us understand the evolution of memory.
Bit : 	
It is a binary digit that holds only 
one of two values : 0 or 1.
Nibble : 	A group of 4 bits is called a 
nibble (For example:1011, 1001, 
1111).
Byte :	
A group of 8 bits is called a 
byte. A byte is the smallest unit, 
which can represent a data item 
or a character. (For example : 
11101100, 10000001)

1.3.4 Concept of Hardware and 
Software : 
Hardware 
: 
Computer 
hardware 
comprises of the physical components 
that a computer system requires to 
function. In simple words hardware 
are the parts which we can see, we can 
touch them, feel them. It encompasses 
everything with a circuit board that 
operates within a Personal Computer 
or Laptop; including the motherboard, 
graphics card, CPU (Central Processing 
Unit), ventilation fans, webcam, power 
supply, and so on.
Software : A set of instructions given 
to the computer is known as a program. 
Program or set of programs are called as 
software. This helps us to interact with the 
computer in order to perform a particular 
task. Software is a generic term used to 
describe computer programs.
1.3.5 Categories of a software : 
Open source software : It refers to the 
software which releases code in public 
domain for anyone to use. The source code 
can be copied, modified or distributed 
by other users and organizations. As the 
software is open to the public, the result is 
that it constantly updates, improves and 
expands as more people can work on its 
improvement. Many states are following 
FOSS policy i.e. Free Open Source 
Software Policy and it enabled them to 
save some million of rupees each year 
in licensing costs. The Kerala state is in 
news as they have adopted FOSS policy 
and saved rupees 300 crore as a license fee 
for proprietary or closed source software.

6
Closed source software : It is opposite to 
Open Source Software and means that the 
software is used by the proprietary and has 
a closely guarded code. Only the original 
authors of organization of a software can 
access, copy, and alter that software. In 
case of closed source software, user has to
purchase the software before using it.
1.3.6 Computer software can be 
classified into two types based on its 
utility :
Application Software : Application 
software is a program or group of 
programs 
designed 
for 
end 
users. 
Applications 
software 
(also 
called 
end-user programs) include programs 
like database programs, word processors, 
web browsers, presentation software, 
spreadsheets etc.
System Software : System Software is a 
set of instructions required for a computer 
to work. For Example, Linux Operating 
system is a program that allows different 
applications and various components of 
hardware such as monitor, printer, mouse, 
keyboard etc. to communicate with each 
other.
Let's understand more about an 
operating system
	 A computer would not be able 
to function correctly without an 
operating system. 
	 An operating system is a software 
program that empowers the computer 
hardware to communicate and operate 
with the computer software.
	 The operating system boots up the 
computer and makes sure that 
everything is operational. 
	 The operating system is also what 
runs the cell phone and most of the 
electronic devices. 
	 The operating systems usually come 
preloaded on any computer, tablet, 
laptop  or cell phone that you buy. 
	 Most people use the operating system 
that comes with their device as 
default. 	
	 It is necessary to use licensed operating 
system and not a copied or a pirated 
one.
	 There are many open source operating 
systems available on the web which are 
freely downloadable. It is advisable to 
use those OS instead of pirated ones. 
*Refer Page 61(Software Piracy)
   Do it yourself 
  	List out the open source and closed 
source software. 
1.3.7 Operating Systems for Personal 
Computers :
DOS : DOS (Disk Operating System) 
was the dominant operating system for 
microcomputers in the 1980's and the 
early 1990's. For working with DOS 
the user needs to know how to input the 
commands using the Command Prompt 
Window.
Windows : Windows is a series of 
operating systems that are designed by 
Microsoft. The first two versions of the 
Windows operating system, introduced 

7
in 1985 and 1987 respectively, were 
primitive. Windows is the most commonly 
used operating system.
Mac OS : Apple Corporation's registered 
operating system is called Mac OS.
Chrome OS : Chrome OS is an 
open-source operating system created 
by Google to create a better computing 
experience for people who spend most of 
their time on the web.
UNIX : UNIX was trademarked in 1969 
by a group of AT&T employees at Bell 
Labs as a multitasking, and multi-user 
computer operating system.
Linux : Linux is an open-source, portable, 
multi-user (multiple users can access 
system resources like memory/RAM/
application programs at the same time), 
multiprogramming, operating system. It 
is very similar to other operating systems, 
such as Windows and a source code is 
available to the public.
1.3.8 Operating Systems for Mobile 
Phones :
There are many different operating 
systems for mobile phones and devices. 
These are Android, Asha, Blackberry, 
iOS, Windows Phone etc.
Android : Android is a free and open 
source operating system provided by 
Google. It is most popular OS amongst 
all other OS.
Asha : Asha is used by Nokia phones. 
This is closed source OS.
Blackberry : This is a closed source 
operating system for smartphone and 
tablet devices.
iOS :  iOS is Apple's closed source 
operating system for Apple's iPhone, 
iPod Touch, iPad and second-generation 
Apple TVs. 
Windows Phone : Windows Phone is 
developed by Microsoft as a closed source 
operating system for mobile phones.
1.4 Introduction to GNU/Linux (GNU 
Not Unix) 
GNU/Linux is a family of operating 
systems that are created by various 
companies, organizations, and individuals. 
It is created by using Free Software 
Philosophies. This means that GNU/ 
Linux operating systems are usually free 
of charge, free to distribute, and they 
are open source. Open Source is when 
a person can view and modify the code 
for a piece of software. This is important 
because by having the ability to look 
and audit the code, user can be sure that 
the program does not perform malicious 
tasks. It also allows the user to program 
their own features, or fix problems, and 
help the developers. This results in higher 
quality code and more secure programs. 
This is why GNU/ Linux is used as the 
predominantly backbone of the Internet. 
Most websites that user visits run on 
GNU/Linux. In fact, as of 2018, all the 
world's fastest 500 computers run Linux. 
Ubuntu is one of the most popular 
GNU/Linux distribution. 
There are two main ways to interact 
with the computer : The GUI (Graphical 
User Interface) and the CLI (Command 
Line Interface)

8
Fig. : 4 Desktop Environment of Ubuntu 18.04
Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
The graphical user interface is when 
the user interacts with the computer using 
images, icons, and dialog boxes. The 
Fig. no. 4 shows what the Ubuntu 18.04 
looks like. This GUI is called GNOME. 
There are a lot of GUI's (Or desktop 
environment) that user can install, but 
this is the default. 
The left bar is called the Panel. There 
are shortcuts to programs, as well as 
currently open programs. The top bar 
has the date and time. If it is clicked a 
menu will pop up with the calendar and 
notifications. Fig. no. 4 shows that the 
top right side will show user the battery 
information, if on a laptop, network

The command line interface is when 
user interacts with the computer using 
text. This is done by typing commands 
into a terminal. The default CLI on 
Ubuntu 18.04 is called 'bash'. It is a 
command processor that runs in a text 
window where the user types commands 
that causes actions. The commands are 
programs that are run when user types 
command name. There are number of 
different commands that user can use. 
Some are explained in Table no. 2.

Table: 2  Few Linux Commands
The GNU/Linux File System Hierarchy 
Standard 
In GNU/Linux, the topmost directory 
is called the root directory, and it is 
written as /. All directories are stored 
under the root directory. For example if 
the user is ABC, the home directory will 
be created at /home/ABC. Everything in 
Linux is represented as a file, this includes 
Cameras, Storage devices, Microphones, 
Network devices, etc. 
This is a brief summary of the file 
system : 
 	 / : The root directory. All files and 
directories are stored under this 
directory, including all hard drives, 
pen drives, CD-Drives, etc.
 	 /bin : Essential system programs are 
stored here.
 /dev : All connected devices are 
stored here. Including internal devices, 
temperature sensors, and batteries.
 	 /etc : System configuration files are 
stored here.
 	 /proc : Files that provide information 
about processes. This is information 
like, how much RAM is free, or how 
fast the CPUs are running.
 	 /tmp : Temporary files are stored here
 	 /home : Users home directories are 
stored here.
There are many more directories. 
The user can read more about them by 

11
searching for "File System Hierarchy 
Standard (FHS)" online. 
Why Learn and Use GNU/ Linux ?
There are huge number of benefits of 
learning GNU/Linux. Sooner or later in 
the career, GNU/Linux will be used in 
the workplace. Millions of desktops and 
servers run on GNU/Linux. The Android 
operating system, that the smartphone 
runs on, is a modified version of GNU/ 
Linux. 
1. Linux is Free and Open Source : 
The word "Free" here does not just 
mean free of charge but also means 
"Freedom". Anyone is free to use this 
software, distribute them freely and 
even study and modify the source 
code to suit one's own need. 
2. 	 Linux Operating System is free from 
viruses : The user need not install any 
anti-virus software. This saves money 
as well as valuable time. The users 
are free from the trouble of updating 
the virus definitions and checking 
unknown USB disk that is plugged 
in. Moreover, anti-virus software is 
not hundred percent reliable. The user 
always runs the risk of losing the data 
if the computer is infected due to the 
failure of anti-virus software. Finally, 
anti-virus software often gives a 
false alarm and may delete the files 
assuming the existence of the virus.
3. 	 Easy  to keep all the software up-
to-date 
: 
Proprietary 
operating 
systems can update themselves. But 
they cannot update other software, 
especially 
proprietary 
software. 
The user has to keep track of each 
application on his own. Linux 
distributions mostly use free software 
so it keeps track of all the softwares 
through repositories. Repositories is 
a collection of software for a Linux 
distribution on the server. The package 
manager updates the operating system 
as well as other softwares periodically.
4.	 Linux 
is 
flexible 
and 
easily 
customizable : The user can change 
the desktop, the position of the menus, 
status bar position, style, default 
file manager, icon theme and lot 
more. Almost everything in Linux is 
customized.
5. 	 Excellent Support : There are 
thousands of forums and millions 
of people ready to help open source 
software users. Each distribution has its 
own community of users and they help 
each other. Many software companies 
and developers of free software 
also offer solutions to the problems 
through community platforms and 
also through professional channels. 
1.5 Computer Network
1.5.1 Introduction : It is a group 
of interconnected computers or devices to 
have communication within themselves. 
A computer network consists of a 
collection of computers, printers and other 
equipment that is connected together so 
that they can communicate with each 
other.
1.5.2 Types of networks : There are 
three types of network based on the 
geographical area they cover : LAN, 
MAN and WAN.

12
The entire use and implementation 
of these types depends upon the 
geographical area they cover, i.e. LAN 
covers the smallest area; MAN covers 
an area larger than LAN and WAN 
comprises the largest of all.
 	 Local Area Network (LAN) :
 
 LAN covers smaller geographical 
area (Size is limited to a few 
kilometers) and are privately 
owned.
	
 Usage area is limited to areas 
such as an office building, home, 
hospital, schools, etc.
	
 It covers a short distance, and so 
the error and noise are minimized.
	
 	 LAN is easy to setup.
	
 	 Data transmits at a very fast rate 
as the number of computers linked 
are limited.
	
 	 It is a less expensive hardware and 
maintenance cost is also low.
 Metropolitan Area Network     	 	
	
(MAN) :
 
 MAN is larger area than that 
of a LAN and smaller area as 
compared to WAN.
	
 	 It connects two or more separate 
computers that reside in the same 
or different cities.
	
 	 It covers a large geographical area 
and may serve as an ISP (Internet 
Service Provider).
	
 	 It is hard to design and maintain a 
Metropolitan Area Network.
	
 	 Examples of a MAN are the part 
of the telephone company network 
that can provide a high-speed DSL 
line to the customer or the cable 
TV network in a city.
  Wide Area Network (WAN) :
 
 	 Wide Area Network is a computer 
network that extends over a large 
geographical area.
	
 It might be confined within the 
bounds of a state or country.
	
 	 A WAN could be a connection of 
LAN connecting to other LAN's 
via telephone lines and radio 
waves.
	
 	 The technology is high speed and 
relatively expensive.
	
 	 A Communication medium used 
for WAN is Telephone Network or 
Satellite Link.
	
 Due to long distance transmission, 
the noise and error tends to be more 
in WAN.
1.6 Network Configurations :
Network architecture is the design of 
a computer network. It is a framework 
for the specification of a network's 
physical components and their functional 
organization and configuration. 
Two of the most widely used types of 
network architecture are peer-to-peer and 
client/server. 
1. 	 Peer-to-Peer Architecture : In this 
type of architecture, all the machines, 
called as "peers", have the same 
status and they can communicate with 

13
Fig. :7 Peer-to-Peer Architecture
any other peer directly. A Peer-to-Peer 
network has no dedicated servers. Its 
implementations are meant for small 
networks. For Example, when students 
creates a network to share files through 
Bluetooth or SHAREit, the mobile 
device forms peer-to-peer network for 
transfer of files.
2. Client-Server Architecture : This 
type of architecture is most suitable 
for larger network. So there are two 
types  of machines in network, client 
and server.
	
Client : A computer which is seeking 
any resource from another computer 
is a client computer. For Example: 
Downloading an image file from a 
website, browsing Intranet/Internet 
etc. The network user normally uses a 
client computer to perform his day to 
day work.
	
Server : If a computer has a resource 
which is served to another computer, 
it is a server computer. The client 
establishes a connection to a server 
and accesses the services installed 
on the server. A server is not meant 
for a network user to browse in 
internet or do spreadsheet work. 
For Example : Multimedia server, File 
storage servers, Webserver etc.
Fig. : 8 Client-Server Architecture
1.6.1 Internet :
Internet means connecting computer 
to any other computer anywhere in 
the world. Internet is the highway of 
information. 
The Internet has one very simple 
job: to move computerized information 
(known as data) from one place to 
another. The Internet is generally defined 
as a global network connecting millions 
of computers. 
The Internet is a massive network of 
networks, a networking infrastructure. 
With the help of the internet one can 
easily be in touch with any one in the 
whole world by sending electronic mail, 
by chatting. Travel bookings can be 
made very easily, one can order books or 
buy anything online. In simple terms it 
can be said that internet provides a very 

14
strong connection or network between 
computers globally, bringing people and 
their working close to each other.
1.6.2 History of Internet :
The first workable prototype of the 
internet came in the late 1960's with the 
creation of ARPANET, or the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency Network. 
Originally funded by the U.S. Department 
of Defense, ARPANET used packet 
switching to allow multiple computers 
to communicate on a single network. 
The technology continued to grow in 
the 1970's after scientists Robert Kahn 
and Vinton Cerf developed Transmission 
Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, 
or TCP/IP, a communications model 
that set standards for how data could be 
transmitted between multiple networks. 
ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 
1983, and from there researchers began to 
assemble the "network of networks" that 
became the modern Internet. The online 
world then took on a more recognizable 
form in 1990, when computer scientist 
Tim Berners-Lee invented the World 
Wide Web (WWW).
1.6.3 Protocols :
A protocol is a set of rules that 
governs the communications between 
computers on a network. In order to have 
two computers to talk to each other, they 
must be speaking the same language. 
Examples of Protocols are-
 	 TCP/IP : Transmission Control 
Protocol & Internet Protocol - It 
breaks down the message into packets 
and sends them out into the network.
 	 DNS : Domain Name System-It 
translates network address (such as 
IP addresses) into terms understood 
by humans (such as Domain Names) 
and vice-versa.
 	 DHCP : Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol - It can automatically assign 
internet addresses to computers and 
users.
 	 FTP : File Transfer Protocol - A 
protocol that is used to transfer and 
manipulate files on the internet.
 	 HTTP : HyperText Transfer Protocol- 
An internet-based protocol for sending 
and receiving web pages.
 	 IMAP : Internet Message Access 
Protocol - A protocol for receiving 
e-mail messages from server on the 
Internet. It maintains a copy of all the 
emails on server. We can sort, filter 
emails.
 	 IRC : Internet Relay Chat - A 
protocol used for Internet chat and 
other communications. It facilitates 
communication in the form of text.
 	 POP3 : Post Office Protocol Version 3 
- A protocol used for receiving e-mail 
from remote mail servers. It does not 
maintain copy on the server.
 	 SMTP : Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol - A protocol for sending 
e-mail messages to the Server on the 
Internet.

1.7 IT Enabled Services
1.7.1 Meaning of IT Enabled Services : 
IT Enabled Services (ITES), also 
called web enabled services or remote 
services or tele-working, covers the 
entire amount of operations which exploit 
Information Technology for improving 
efficiency of an organization. The most 
important aspect is the value addition of 
IT Enabled Service. The value addition 
could be in the form of Customer 
relationship 
management, 
improved 
database, improved look and feel, etc.  
The outcome of an IT Enabled Service is 
in two forms :
	 Direct Improved Service.
	 Indirect Benefits.
Whereas direct benefits can be 
realised immediately, indirect benefits 
can occur over a period of time, and can 
be harnessed very effectively, if planned 
well up front.

2.1 Introduction
In our day to day life every person 
uses database in various ways. Like 
people use phone diary or phone book 
which contains name, address email id, 
phone number etc. 
Doctor maintains medical history of 
patients. Librarian maintains records of 
their book details, issue date, return date. 
etc. Teacher keeps records of students like 
name, roll number, Marks etc. In these 
examples every one maintains records in 
a systematic manner. 
In a computer system, we always 
maintain our records. At this point a 
database is very useful.
2.2 Definition of a Database
Database is collection of interrelated 
data which helps in efficient retrieval, 
inserting and deleting of data. In exams, 
marks obtained by the student in subjects 
is data before it is entered in the report

card. In a report card, the combined 
(marks) data of all subjects speaks about 
students performance. Thus when data 
is maintained in an organized manner 
it becomes meaningful or organized 
information.

2.3 Introduction to Database 
Management System (DBMS) 
A database, often abbreviated as DB, 
is a collection of information organized 
in such a way that a computer program 
can quickly select desired pieces of data. 
A Database Management System 
(DBMS) is a software for creating 
and managing databases. The DBMS 
provides users and programmers with a 
systematic way to create, retrieve, update 
and manage data. It stores data in such 
a way that it becomes easier to retrieve, 
manipulate, and update information. 
Examples of popular DBMS are : 
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Access, Oracle, 
SQL Server, IBM, DB2 and Sybase.
2.4 Some Applications of DBMS
 	 Railway Reservation System :
	
Database is required to keep record of 
ticket booking, train's departure and 
arrival status, status of seats available 
etc.
 	 Library Management System : 
	
There are thousands of books in the 
library so it is very difficult to keep 
a record of all the books in a copy or 
register. So DBMS is used to maintain 
all the information related to book 
issue dates, name of the book, author 
and availability of the book.
 	 Banking :
	
People 
make 
thousands 
of 
transactions through banks daily and 
they can do this without going to the 
bank. So now banking has become 
so easy that by sitting at home bank 
customers can send or get money 
through banks. All this is possible just 
because of DBMS that manages all 
the bank transactions.
 	 Universities and Colleges : 
	
Examinations are done online today 
and universities and colleges maintain 
all these records through DBMS. 
Student's registration details, results, 
courses and grades all the information 
is stored in a database.
 	 Credit Card Transactions : 
	
For purchase of credit cards and 
all the other transactions are made 
possible only by DBMS. A credit 
card holder knows the importance of 
his information that all are secured 
through DBMS.
 	 Social Media Sites : 
	
We all are on social media websites to 
share our views and connect with our 
friends. Daily, millions of users sign 
up for these social media accounts 
like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest 
and Google plus. But how is all the 
information of users stored and how 
are we able to connect to other people? 
Yes, this is all because of DBMS.
2.5 Advantages of DBMS
 Reducing Data Redundancy :
	
The file based data management 
systems contained multiple files 
that were stored in many different 
locations in a system or even across 
multiple systems. Because of this, 
there were sometimes multiple copies 
of the same file which lead to data 
redundancy.

22
	
	
This is prevented in a database 
as there is a single database and any 
change in it is reflected immediately. 
Because of this, there is no chance of 
encountering duplicate data. 
 	 Sharing of Data :
	
In a database, the users of the 
database can share the data among 
themselves. 
There 
are 
various 
levels of authorisation to access 
the data, and consequently the data 
can only be shared based on the 
correct authorisation protocols being 
followed. 
	
	
Many remote users can also access 
the database simultaneously and 
share the data between themselves.
 	 Data Integrity :
	
Data integrity means that the data 
is accurate and consistent in the 
database. Data Integrity is very 
important as there are multiple 
databases in a DBMS. All of these 
databases contain data that is visible
	
to multiple users. So it is necessary 
to ensure that the data is correct and 
consistent in all the databases and for
	
all the users.
 	 Data Security :
	
Data Security is vital concept in 
a database. Only authorised users 
should be allowed to access the 
database and their identity should be
	
authenticated using a username and 
password. Unauthorised users should 
not be allowed to access the database
	
under any circumstances as it violates 
the integrity constraints.
 	 Privacy :
	
The privacy rule in a database means 
only the authorized users can access 
a database according to its privacy 
constraints. There are levels of 
database access and a user can only 
view the data. For example - In social 
networking sites, access constraints 
are different for different accounts a 
user may want to access.
 	 Backup and Recovery :
	
Database 
Management System 
automatically takes care of backup 
and recovery. The users don't need 
to backup data periodically because 
this is taken care of by the DBMS. 
Moreover, it also restores the database
	
after a crash or system failure to its 
previous condition. 
 	 Development and Maintenance Time : 
	
DBMS 
reduces 
application 
development 
and 
maintenance 
time. It supports many important 
functions that are common to many 
applications, accessing data stored 
in the DBMS, which facilitates the 
quick development of application.
2.6 Data types in the DBMS
When you create a table or add a 
field to a table in the database, fields 
are created with specific data type. Data 
types are classifications that identify 
possible values for and operations that 
can be done on the data, as well as the 
way the data in that field is stored in the 
database.

2.7 Data model 
Database is designed according to 
certain rules. This logical structure of 
database is known as a model. Data 
models define how the data is connected 
to each other and how they are processed 
and stored inside the system. 
It describes the method of storing and 
retrieving the data. There are different 
models like network model, hierarchical 
model and relational model. Let us see 
relational model. 
Relational Model : 
	
The most popular data model in DBMS 
is the Relational Model. Relational data 
model is the primary data model, which 
is used widely around the world for data 
storage and processing. This model is 
simple and has all the properties and 
capabilities required to process data with 
storage efficiency.
	
A transaction is a unit of work that
is performed against a database.
For example, if you are creating
a record or updating a record or
deleting a record from the table, then
you are performing a transaction on
that table. It is important to control
these transactions to ensure the data
integrity and to handle database
errors.
Properties of Transactions : 
Transactions have the following four 
standard properties, usually referred to 
by the acronym ACID.

Atomicity : It ensures that all
operations within the work unit are
completed successfully. Otherwise,
the transaction is aborted at the

point of failure and all the previous 
operations are rolled back to their 
former state. 
 	 Consistency : It ensures that the da­
tabase properly changes states upon a 
successfully committed transaction. 
 	 Isolation : It enables transactions to 
operate 
independently 
of 
and 
transparent to each other.
 	 Durability : It ensures that the result 
or effect of a committed transaction 
persists in case of a system failure.
2.8 Introduction of RDBMS
	
RDBMS 
stands 
for 
Relational 
Database 
Management 
System. 
In 
RDBMS a database is considered as a 
collection of interrelated data. 
Basic Database Concept 
 Table : The table is the basic data 
storage unit in a Relational database. 
Table consists of columns and rows. 
A database consists of one or more 
tables according to which data is 
stored in a table. Database designer 
decides the name of the table and 
titles of columns.
 	 Field : A table consists of information 
which is stored under different 
headings, called as fields or columns.
Columns are shown vertically in a 
table. Each field or column has an 
individual name. Two columns cannot 
have the same name. In Fig. no. 1, the 
first row represents the different field 
names or titles of columns. 
 	 Record : All the columns in a table 
make a row. Each row contains 
information on individual topics. 
A record is composed of fields and 
contains all the data about one 
particular person, company, or item 
in a database. Record is also called 
as a Tuple.
 	 Key : A column or a combination of 
columns which can be used to identify 
one or more rows (tuples) in a table is 
called a key of the table.

 	 Primary Key : The group of one 
or more columns used to uniquely 
identify each row of a relation is 
called its Primary Key.
 	 Foreign Key : It is a field (or collection 
of fields) in one table that refers to the 
Primary Key in another table. 
Relationships in database :
Relationships 
link 
data 
from
individual tables to increase the usefulness 
of the database. 
 A relationship in the context of 
databases, is a situation that exists 
between two relational database tables 
when one table has a foreign key that  is 
used as a reference to the primary key of 
the other table. 
For example, a table called Employees 
has a primary key called employee_id. 
Another table called Employee Details 
has a foreign key which references 
employee_id in order to uniquely identify 
the relationship between the two tables.
There are 3 types of relationships in 
relational database design. They are :
 	 One-to-One
 	 One-to-Many (or Many-to-One)
 	 Many-to-Many
These are explained below.
One-to-One :
In a one-to-one relationship, one 
record in a table is associated with one 
and only one record in another table. For 
example, in a company database, each 
employee has only one Person_ ID, and 
One-to-Many (or Many-to-One)
This is the most common relationship 
type. In this type of relationship, a row 
in table City can have many matching 
rows in table Customer, but a row in table 
Customer can have only one matching 
row in table City
each Passport_ ID is assigned to only one 
person.
A one-to-one relationship looks like 
below in the relationships graph :
Example of one-to-many relationship
One-to-Many relationships can also 
be viewed as Many-to-One relationships, 
depending on which way you look at it.
In the above example, the Customer 
table is the "many" and the City table 
is the "one". Each customer can only 
be assigned one city,. One city can be 
assigned to many customers.
Fig. 2
Fig. 3

26
Many-to-Many
A many-to-many relationship occurs 
when multiple records in a table are 
associated with multiple records in 
another table. 
Multiple records in Table Product 
are linked to multiple records in Table 
Suppliers.

2.10 Categories of SQL Commands
Data Definition Language (DDL)
Commands 
DDL statements or commands are 
used to define and modify the database 
structure of your tables or schema. When 
you execute a DDL statement, it takes 
effect immediately.

2.9 Introduction to SQL 
SQL is Structured Query Language,  
which is a computer language for 
storing, manipulating and retrieving data 
stored in a relational database. SQL is 
the standard language for Relational 
Database Management System. All 
relational database management systems 
like MySQL, Base, Oracle, Sybase, 
Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use 
SQL as standard database language.
	SQL became a standard of the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
in 1986, and of the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
in 1987.
Using SQL You  Can :
  Create new databases.
	 	Create new tables in a database
	 	Insert records in a database
  	Retrieve data from a database

Impressive Web Designing
Fig. : 3.1 Working of Web 
The internet is a powerful media 
to transmit information. The pages of 
information displayed on the internet are 
referred to as webpages. The standards 
and formats for presenting text and 
graphics on the internet are developed 
and approved by WWW governing 
authorities.
The growing demand for attractive 
presentation 
of 
information 
using 
electronic means gave rise to the invention 
of websites.

3.4 Introduction to HTML5
HTML is a standard language for 
developing 
and 
creating 
interactive 
websites, introduced by Tim Berners Lee. 
HTML documents are created in any 
text editor for and can be run(executed) 
on any computer that has a web browser. 
HTML is compatible with most of the 
web browsers.
Basic structure : HTML tags are 
keywords 
enclosed 
within 
angular 
brackets,  that define how your web 
browser must format and display the 
content. Tags are not case sensitive. Every 
HTML page is enclosed within two tags 
<html> and </html>. This page is divided 
into two sections internally, head section 
and body section. Head section contains 
title of the document which is enclosed 
within <Title> and </Title> of <Head> and 
</Head>. The actual text of the document 
is written within <Body> and </Body>.
An attribute : An attribute defines a 
property for an element, consists of an 
attribute/value, and appears within the 
element's start tag. Sometime we need 
additional information with a tag.
3.3 Components of web 
Web uses the following Terms :
	
Webpage :  A simple text file created
using HTML.
	
Website : A collection of interlinked
web pages containing text, images,
audio and videos. For Example,  www.
ebalbharati.in
	
Web Browser : A web browser is a
software used to view web pages or
websites available on the internet For
Example Internet Explorer, Google
Chrome, Mozilla Firefox.
	
Web Server : A Web server is an
application or a computer that sends
webpages over the internet using the
HTTP protocol. The functionality of
website is managed by web server. For
Example Apache, nginx, IIS, etc..
	
URL(Uniform Resource Locator) :
It is an address of a web page on the
internet. The web pages are retrieved
from the original location with the
help of URL.
	
HTTP : HTTP (HyperText Transfer
Protocol) is a protocol used by WWW
for client server communication.
	
HTML 
: 
Hyper 
Text 
Markup
Language, enables to write code for
a webpage. All the webpages in a
website are linked with one another,
with the help of hypertext links.
Do it yourself
 	 A collection of webpages is called...
 ............is an address of a webpage.

Classification of HTML Tags
HTML tags are categorized as :
1.  Container tags	 2.  Empty tags
1. 	 Container Tags : Container Tags are 
also called paired tags. Container 
Tags have a beginning tag and an 
end tag. The end tag is similar to the 
beginning tag but with a ''/'' in front 
of it. For Example <head> </head>, 
<body> </body>.
2. 	 Empty Tags :  Empty tags are 
standalone tags and do not have 
an end tag. <Br> is an example of 
singular tag/Empty tag.
Basic structure of  HTML 
Purpose of tags :
	 <html> and </html> : This tag 
indicates that the document is an html 
file.
	 <head> and </head> : It includes 
<Title> within it, the text within 
<head> is not displayed on the 
webpage. This is used for search 
engine optimization.
	 <title> and </title> : The content 
within this tag is displayed on the title 
bar.
	 <body> and </body> : This tag 
includes all content which is to be 
developed in the web browser. Most 
of the tags are included in this tag.
Structure of web page using HTML5 :
The first line on the top, <!DOCTYPE 
html>, is a document type declaration 
and it lets the browser know the flavor of 
HTML.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head> <title>Your Website</title>

3.5 Text formatting element 
Text formatting is used to make 
a document look attractive thereby 
enhancing it's appearance. The list of 
different text level formatting tags are as 
shown in Table no. 1 :
This text is bold
This text is italic
This text is marked
This text is inserted to the document
This text is deleted from the document
This is subscript and superscript

3.6 Heading levels 
HTML provides six levels of heading 
tags. The range is from 1 to 6. These 
heading levels are represented as <H1> 
Text content </H1>. The <H1> tag 
displays text in bold and with largest 
heading level whereas <H6> tag displays 
text in the smallest heading level.
Note : All the heading levels have 
attribute align with values left, right 
and center..
Note : Use any text editor to type the 
code and save it with ' filename. html' 
or ' filename. htm'. Use  a browser to 
display the output.

3.7 Inserting an image, a horizontal 
ruled line and a paragraph
 <IMG> tag   is used to insert an image 
within a webpage. It uses following 
attributes :
	 src : It is used to specify the path of 
an image file. The popular extensions 
of image file are png, jpg and gif.
	 height : Specifies height of the image 
in pixels.
	 width : Specifies width of the image 
in pixels.
	 alt : It is referred as alternate text. It  
specifies the description of the image.

35
<IMG> is a empty tag. The syntax used 
in code is as :
<IMG src="Desert.jpg" height="400" 
width="400" alt="Desert image">
 <HR> tag : <Hr> tag is used to display 
horizontal ruled line. It is  a singular 
tag. The attributes with <hr> tag
	 color : Sets color for the horizontal 
ruled line.
	 width : It specifies the length of the 
ruled line in % or pixels.
	 size : It sets thickness of a ruled line.
 <P> tag : It is used to define paragraphs. 
It is a container tag.
3.8 Creating a table 
A table is made up of rows and 
columns. A table in a webpage is created 
by using <table> tag, which is a container 
tag. The tags and attributes used to create 
a table are as follows : 
<table> :	 It is used to indicate creation of 
a table.
<caption> :	 It is used to specify a table 
heading. It has align attribute which can 
have 'top' or 'bottom' as it's values. Top is 
the default value.
<tr>  :  This tag is used to create each 
row of the table.
<th> : It indicates table heading. <th> 
is generally used for first row column 
content of the table. It displays content in 
the bold format. It can be replaced with 
<td>.
<td> :  It specifies data within the table 
(cell content).
The attributes of table are :
1.	 border : This attribute is required to 
display a border for the entire table. 
It has a numbered value. If border 
attribute is not specified, a table is 
created without the border for both 
table as well as columns.
2.	 bordercolor : It displays border in  a 
specific color.
3.	 align : It aligns the table either to the 
left, right or center.
4.	 bgcolor : Sets the background color 
for the table.
The attributes of the <tr>, <th>, <td> :
1.	 align : It aligns the text horizontally. 
The values are aligned to the left, right 
or center. 
2.	 colspan : This attribute is used within 
<td> or <th>. It creates a single column 
spanning across the table. It takes a 
numbered value, based on the number 
of columns to be spanned in a table.
3.	 rowspan : This attribute is used within 
<td> or <th>. It creates a single row 
spanning across the table. It takes a 
numbered value, based on the number 
of rows to be spanned in a table.
<tr>, <th>, <td> tags can have bgcolor 
attribute for specifying background 
color to a row or a column respectively.

3.9 Creating hyperlinks in a webpage
Hyperlinks are used to connect one 
document with another document. 
In HTML, Links are created by using 
<a> tag.
Syntax :
<a href = ''Mypage. htm''> Click here for 
my page </a>
The href attribute in the above syntax 
is used to specify address of the file (URL) 
which needs to be opened on clicking.
HTML Link colours :
	 A hyperlink by default appears blue 
in colour with an underline.
	 It is not visited by any user.
	 A visited link is underlined and purple.
	 An active link is underlined and blue.
Image hyperlink : 
Many websites have images as 
hyperlink. For example The previous 
arrow is an image which on clicking 
displays a previous webpage. The arrow 
is actually an image hyperlink.
Syntax :
<a href = "Mypage2.htm"><Img src = 
"arrow. gif" alt = "Click on arrow"></a>
Note : When you open any website and 
click on a text or an image it takes you 
to that page. It is known as hyperlink.

3.10	Forms in HTML 
Forms in HTML is used to accept 
user input. The form in html is created by 
using <form> element as <form></form>.
Form controls
A form is a collection of different 
elements also called as controls like 
textbox, radio button, checkbox, submit 
button and many more.
Attributes used with form element and 
Input element.
<Form> tag can have following attributes 
 	 Name : It specifies a name to a form.
 	 Action 
: 
The 
action 
attribute
specifies the path where the form is 
to be submitted. When user clicks on 
submit button if the action attribute 
is committed, the action is set to the 
current page.
 	 Method : The method attribute 
specifies get or post method to be 
used when submitting the form data. 
Method of form are GET or POST. 
i)	 GET method : The default method 
of submitting form data is GET. The 
data submitted by using GET is visible 
in the address bar. It is better for data 
which is not sensitive. The number of 
characters in GET method depends on 
browser.
ii)	 POST Method : The POST method 
of sending data does not display the 
form data in the address bar. So it is 
a secure method to submit sensitive or 
personal information. It does not have 
size limitations as in GET method.
The <Input> tag
	
The <Input> tag is used to specify 
the different types of controls by using 
type attribute. Syntax of using <Input> 
with type attribute is; 
Type of control
Purpose
<Input type = 
"text">
Creates a one line textbox
<Input type = 
"radio">
Creates a radio button. 
The radio button allows one 
option selection against 
multiple choices.
<Input type = 
"checkbox">
Creates a checkbox. It 
allows more than one 
selection against multiple 
choices.
<Input type = 
"submit">
Displays a button for 
submitting the form data to 
a server.
<Input type = 
"password">
The password input type is 
used to create text 
contents in the form of '*' 
asterik or '•' disc.
<Input type = 
"reset">
The reset control clears the 
text content entered in the 
form.
<Input type = 
"button">
It displays push button 
which activates on events.
	 Attributes of <Input> : Apart from 
type attribute, there are attributes 
which are specific to a particular 
type of controls. The following table 
specifies the description.
Table: 2 <Input> with values of type      
attribute 

39
Attribute
Description
Type
It describes, the name of the 
control like text radio etc. eg 
type = "radio"
Name
Each input field must have 
a name. The name attribute 
is a user defined value. If 
the name attribute is not 
specified, the data of that 
input field will not get 
submitted.
Maxlength
This attribute is used with 
text and password type. 
It specifies the maximum 
number of characters which 
can be entered in a text or 
password box.
Size
The 'Size' attribute can be 
used with text and password 
type. It specifies the width of 
the text box.
Checked
The 
'Checked' 
attribute 
specifies the default selection 
for options in a checkbox or 
radio button.
Value
The 'Value' attribute can be 
used with text, checkbox, 
radio, submit or reset.
 When used with text type 
it specifies default value 
in a text box.
 For checkbox and radio it 
defines value which is sent 
on submit.
<Textarea> tag  :
	The <textarea> is used to create a 
textbox with multiple lines. The number 
of lines and width of the textbox are 
specified by using rows and cols attribute 
respectively. The <textarea> can have 
following attributes.
 	 name : It is used to specify name for 
the textarea. For example name = 
"ta1".
 	 rows : It specifies the number of lines 
in a textarea. For example rows = "5"
 	 cols : It specifies the width of a text 
area.
 	 maxlength : It specifies the maximum 
number of characters allowed in the 
textarea.
 	 placeholder : It specifies a short hint 
that describes the expected value of a 
textarea. For example              placeholder 
= "your address"
 	 required : It specifies that textarea 
must be filled out. i.e. It can not be 
blank.
Syntax :
<textarea name = "tal" rows = "5" cols 
= "30" placeholder = "your address" 
required> </textarea>
<Select> tag : <select>  tag is  used. 
to create drop-down list. 
The attributes of <select> tag are :
1)	 Name - Assigns name to the 
control.
2)	 Multiple - It allows the user to 
select more than one value.

Note 
: 
It's 
best 
practice 
to 
terminate JavaScript statements with 
semicolon(;). It's not required if you 
write each statement on a new line. 	
Client Side Scripting
(For Commerce and Science stream)
3.11 Introduction 
There are a variety of scripting 
languages used to develop dynamic web  
pages. JavaScript was initially created 
to 
"make 
webpages 
alive". 
They 
don't need a special preparation or a 
compilation to run. Using HTML one 
can only design a web page but cannot 
implement any logic on web browsers 
like addition of two numbers, check 
any 
condition, 
looping 
statements  
(for, while), decision making statements  
(if-else) etc. This is possible by embedding  
JavaScript block into HTML.
3.12 Scripting language 
A script is a list of commands that 
are executed by a scripting engine. 
Scripts are used to generate dynamic 
Web pages on the Web. Scripts can 
be opened and edited by using a  
text editor. 
Insertion of JavaScript in HTML :
 JavaScript can be use for client 
side or server side scripting language. 
JavaScript code can be inserted in 
HTML 
program 
between 
<script> 
and  </script> tag. type attribute is used 
to set scripting language. You can 
place any number of scripts in HTML. 
There 
are two methods to insert 
JavaScript in the HTML. Scripts can be 
placed in <body> or in <head> section 
of an HTML or in both.  
3.13 Variables 
The variable is a basic unit of storage 
in a JavaScript program. 
Rules to declare variables :
Variable name may consist of 
alphabets, digits and underscore and 
dollar character with following rules :
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>First</title> </
head>
<body>
<script type="text/Javascript">	
//  javascript statements
    </script>
</body>
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title> Second </title> 
<script type="text/Javascript">	
// javascript statements
    </script>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
Script Placed inside head section
Script Placed inside body section

43
1.	 They must start with an alphabet.
2.	 Uppercase and lowercase are distinct.
This means that variable 'sum' is not
same as 'SUM'.
3.	 It should not contain blank space or
special symbol except underscore.
4.	 Standard keywords are not allowed
as variable name. For Example
document, while.
5.	 Variable name can be limited up to
255 characters.
Variable name in javascript is
declared with keyword 'var'. 
Syntax :	
var variablename; 	
var variablename, variablename;
	
//To declare more than one variable, 
variablenames are separated by a 
comma.
Example :
var a //variable a has been declared.
var a,b,c // variables a, b and c have been 
declared.
	 var z=40,y=100// declaring variables 
with initialization
3.14 Data Types
	
Computer 
is 
mainly 
used 
to 
store information and to do complex 
calculations. When we store information 
it is in the form of alphabets, numbers or 
alphanumeric values. JavaScript provides 
data types to store and use different types 
of values that are : 
1.	 Number type : Numerical value
specially belongs to the 'number'
data type. Number data type stores
(holds) both whole number (integer)
or decimal point numbers which stores
fractional part of number (also called
as floating point numbers). Number
data type can hold positive as well as
negative values.
2.	 String Type : Strings are used for
storing text. Strings must be inside of
either double or single quotes.
3.	 Boolean Type : It represents only two
values 'true' and 'false'. All relation­
al, conditional and logical operators
produce Boolean values true/false or
yes/no.
4. Infinity : Division by 0 gives you an­
other special value.
Do it yourself
 	 Define five correct and five incorrect
variable names.	
List some scripting languages.
Example : 
var y=100000 		
var z= -67.99	
   Example : 
      var x=''Hello"
     var str= 'Information Technology' 
Example :  a=3/0    
Result: Infinity

44
5. null : In JavaScript null is, just a value
which means "nothing", "empty",
"unknown". It is supposed to be
something that doesn't exist.
6.	 undefined 
: 
JavaScript 
returns 
'undefined' when variable which is
declared but not assigned. Then java
interpreter shows that it is undefined.
3.15 Operators
Operators are used to do arithmetic 
and logical operations. Operators that

   c=a*b;
   document.write("<br><h1>multiplication of two numbers : " +c+"</h1>");
</script></body></html>
Note : -  Type your Javascript program in editors and execute it in browser 
similar to HTML programs.
require one operand is called as unary 
operator and operators that require two ope
rands are called as binary operator. Most 
of the operators can be divided into groups :  
Arithmetic, 
Relational 
and 
Logical 
operators. 
3.15.1 Arithmetic operators : 
Arithmetic operators are used in 
mathematical expressions in the same 
way that they are used in algebra. For 
following example consider:	
var a = 40, b = 4.5;

3.15.3 Assignment Operators (=) :
It is important to know that assignment 
operator is not 'equal to' operator. 
Assignment operator is used to assign 
value of an expression to a variable. This 
means that value of an expression on the 
right hand side is assigned to the single 
variable on the left hand side. Value of 
variable may change during the next 
programming instruction.
Expression : There is a difference 
between 
algebraic 
mathematical 
equations and computer programming 
statements. 
Following 
statements 
are valid expressions in algebraic 
mathematics, but they are invalid in 
programming languages.
Example :  
var p=400; //assigns value to the variable p
var e=457.930;//assigns value to the variable e
var a=a+7;// evaluates expression a+7 and  		
assigns value to a
var str="Hello"; //  assigns string value to  			
variable str
var c=d; //assigns value of d to c	
a+b=10;  		
//error
	 a+b=c+d;		
//error
	 c+d=p;		
//error
	 10=x;		
//error
	 X=10;		
//valid
Note :   Remember that in a programming 
statement = operator just evaluates 
right side expression and assigns it to 
the left hand side variable so at the 
left hand side  of = , operator always 
contains a single variable.
Example :  var a=15+"Hello" 
Result : 15Hello
Example :  var a=15+7+"Hello" 
Result : 22Hello
Program to calculate multiplication of two numbers
Multiplication of two numbers : 7558.2
Here, document. write() is used to 
display or write content on a web page.
3.15.2 '+' operator in JavaScript : 
In JavaScript '+' operator has two 
meanings, arithmetic addition and string 
concatenation operator.
Output 8 :
Do it yourself
 	Find the result of....	
1. 20+'20'	
2. 10+20+''2"	
3. 10+'2'+'2'

46

3.15.4 Relational Operators :
Relational operators are used to check conditions or comparison of operands.  
Result of relational operators is Boolean value 'true' or 'false'. They are used in 
looping and control structures. Following table shows JavaScript relational operators. 
For result consider the values as :  a=10 and b=30... 
Operator
Description
Example Result
<
Less than
a<b
True
>
Greater than
a>b
False
<=
Less than equal to
a<=b
True
>=
Greater than equal to
a>=b
False
==
Equal to
a==b
False
!=
Not equal to
a!=b
True
3.15.5 Logical Operators :
Logical operators are used to verify more than one condition at a time or to 
negate the condition. JavaScript has three logical operators.
Operator
Description
Example 
Result
&&
(and)
This operator evaluates 
to 'true' only when all 
its operands are 'true'.
var age=25; 
var  salary=50000;
if(age>55 && 
salary>25000)
First condition evaluates to false and 
second condition evaluates to true, so 
that whole expression returns Boolean 
value as false.
||
(or)
This operator evaluates 
to 'true' when any one 
of the operand is 'true'.
var number =-1;
if(number<0 ||  
number>100)
First condition evaluates to true and 
second condition evaluates to false, so 
whole expression returns Boolean value 
true.
!
(not)
This unary operator 
is used to invert the 
Boolean expression. 
var z=0; 
if(!(z==0))
Expression returns Boolean value as 
false.

3.15.6 Increment (++) and Decrement (--)Operators :
Increment (++) operator in JavaScript is used to increment value of variable by one 
and Decrement operator in JavaScript is used to decrement value of variable by one. 
They can be used in two ways :
++x Pre- increment
Value of variable x is incremented before it is used in 
expression
x++ Post -increment
Value of variable x is incremented after it is used in 
expression
--x
Pre- decrement
Value of variable x is decremented before it is used in 
expression
x--
Post -decrement Value of variable x is decremented after it is used in 
expression
Example :	
Comments in JavaScript
Comments are non-executable statements in program. Comments are used 
to provide information or explanation about your programming construct. 
Statements added in comments are ignored by JavaScript. It supports two types 
of comments.
1.		
Single line comment (//..............) : Single line comment begin with //. The 
JavaScript ignores everything from // to the end of the line.
2.		
Multiline comment : Multiline comments are used to comment on more than
one line. It starts with /* and end with */
var a=100;  
b=++a
output :  b=101 and a=101
var a=100;
b=a++;
output :  b=100 and a=101

Note : length is a property of string object used to calculate length of string.
Note : alert(), prompt() and confirm() are window functions we can use it without 
the window prefix.
3.16 Commonly used Built-In Functions in JavaScript

1)	 if  statement :	
Syntax :
If the conditional expression given in 
the parenthesis is true, then the statements 
within the block will be executed, followed 
by execution of the remaining program. 
If the conditional expression evaluates 
to false, then the statement block will not be 
executed. Note that if statement block 
constitutes a single statement, then 
drawing curly brackets is optional.

3.18  User Defined Functions 
A function in any scripting and 
programming languages is small part 
of program that we require again and 
again. It helps to make program smaller, 
A function is a subprogram designed to 
perform a particular task. Functions can 
be called either by an event or by giving 
call to that function.

3.18.1 Event Handling :
JavaScript 
is 
an 
event-driven 
language. Event is an action done by 
the user or an application. JavaScript's 
interaction with HTML is handled through 
events that occur when user or browser 
manipulates page. When the page loads, 
it is called an event, When the user clicks 
a button, that click is also an event. Other 
examples include events like pressing 
any key, closing a window, resizing a 
window, etc.
JavaScript lets you execute a code 
when events are detected. You can respond 
to any event using an Event Handler, 
which is just a function that's called 
when an event occurs. This event handler 
may cause button  to close windows, 
messages to be displayed to users, data 
to be validated and virtually any other 
type of response. Some commonly used 
events are :
Event Handler

Mouse Events
onMouseOut
When user moves the 
mouse away from an 
element
onClick
When user clicks an 
element
onMouseOver
When user moves 
the mouse over an

<colgroup>  and <col> Tags
<colgroup> 
The <colgroup> (short for column 
group) tag specifies a group of one or more 
columns in a table for formatting. The 
<colgroup> tag is used to apply styles to 
one or more columns. This eliminates the 
need to apply theses styles at individual 
<TD> level. The <colgroup> tag is written 
as <colgroup>... </colgroup>
<Col>
<Col> tag is used within <colgroup> 
tag. The <col> tag has no end tag.

HTML <tbody>, <thead>, <tfoot>Tag :
Table rows may be grouped into a 
table head, table foot and one or more 
table body sections, using the <thead>, 
<tfoot> and <tbody> tags, respectively.
Browsers can use these elements to enable 
scrolling of the table body independently 
of the header and footer. Also, when 
printing a large table that spans multiple 
pages, these elements can enable the table 
header and footer to be printed at the top 
and bottom of each page.
<thead> tag is used in conjuction with 
<tbody>&<tfoot>tag. <tr>&<td>tags are 
used inside<thead>, <tbody>&<tfoot>tag 
to create data item of respective section.

CYBER LAW
4.1 Introduction 
Today we use computers for storing 
confidential data from various sectors 
such as banking, finance, health, personal 
property etc. We also use internet for 
transactions of information related to 
these sectors.  But in many situations, the 
confidential data may be illegally used, 
and corrupted by unauthorised users. The 
increase in Internet traffic has led to a 
higher 
proportion 
of 
legal 
issues 
worldwide. So it is very necessary to 
protect such data from Cyber criminals. 
Cyber cases related to interference and 
investigation are increasing at 
an 
alarming rate. To control such crimes, it 
is necessary  to follow ethics in field of 
computer. Cyberlaw is being amended 
quite regularly.
Introduction to Cyberlaw :
Cyberlaw is the area of law that deals 
with 
the 
Internet's 
relationship 
to 
technological and electronic elements, 
including computers, software, hardware 
and information systems (IS).
Let us Learn 
 	 Introduction to Cyber Law.
	 	 Ethics and Morals.
	 	 Cyber crime and its examples.
	 	 Cyber Safety and Security
	 	 IT Act 2000.
	 	 Case Studies
Cyberlaw is the part of the overall 
legal system that deals with the Internet, 
cyberspace, and their respective legal 
issues. Cyber law covers a fairly broad 
area, encompassing several subtopics 
including freedom of expression, access 
to and usage of the Internet, and online 
privacy.
Advantages of Cyber Law :
The IT Act 2000 attempts to change 
outdated laws and provides ways to deal  
with cybercrimes. We need such laws so 
that. 
	 People can perform transactions over 
the Internet through credit cards 
without fear of misuse. 
	 The IT Act offers the much-needed 
legal framework so that information 
is not denied legal effect, validity or 
enforceability, solely on the ground 
that it is in the form of electronic 
records.
	 In view of the growth in transactions 
and communications carried out 
through electronic records, the Act 
seeks 
to 
empower 
government 
departments to accept filing, creating 
and retention of official documents in 
the digital format. 
	 The IT Act has also proposed a legal 
framework for the authentication and 
origin 
of 
electronic 
records/
communications 
through 
digital 
signature.

61
4.2  Ethics and Morals 
 Ethics : Also called moral philosophy 
is the discipline concerned with what 
is morally good and bad, right or 
wrong.
 Morals : The standards of behaviour; 
principles 
of 
right 
and 
wrong 
behaviour. Thus morals are dictated 
by society, culture or religion while 
ethics are chosen by the person himself 
which governs his life. This chapter 
introduces the do's and dont's of cyber 
world.
4.3  Cyber Crime
Computer Crime is alternatively 
referred to as cybercrime, e-crime, 
(electronic crime) or hi-tech crime. 
Computer crime is an act performed by a 
knowledgeable computer user, sometimes 
referred to as a hacker who illegally 
browses or steals a company's or 
individual's private information. In some 
cases, this person or group of individuals 
may be malicious and destroy or otherwise 
corrupt the computer or data files.
Cyber crimes can involve criminal 
activities that are traditional in nature, 
such as theft, fraud, forgery, defamation 
and mischief, all of which are subject to 
the Indian Penal Code.
Some Examples of cyber crime : 
Below is a list of the different types of 
computer crimes -
 	 Software Piracy : Software piracy is 
nothing but copyright violation of 
software created originally by an 
individual or an institution. It includes 
stealing of codes/ programs and other 
information illegally and creating the 
imitated copy by unauthorized means 
and utilizing this data either  for own 
benefit  or for profit  making.
	
Example : When you download a 
copy of a licensed software. For 
example downloading games from a 
file sharing website without paying 
for it, it is a software piracy.
 	 Unauthorized access : Gaining 
access without the users' permission is 
known 
as 
unauthorized 
access. 
Authorization means granting access 
rights to resources, which is related to 
information security computer security 
and to access control in particular sector. 
This is typically possible when the 
particular software/service  is purchased 
through legal and formal procedure. 
Attempting to get information (like 
emails, bank account, intellectual or any 
other 
personal 
and 
confidential 
information) from unauthorized person 
is known as accessing the machine 
illegally. Examples of unauthorized 
access are :
 	 Hacking financial / bank account 
related information.
 	 Stealing organizational /
intellectual information.
 	 Illegal monitoring of information 
owned by other users.
 	 Illegal use/break of login and 
password of other users.
   Do it yourself 
  	Search Cyber crime related Laws & 
punishment for it.

62
 	 Causing intentional irritation to 
other users by means of damaging 
software 
and 
important 
information.
	 Copyright violation : A copyright is 
a legal right that gives the creator of a 
literary, artistic, musical, or other 
creative work the sole right to publish 
and sell that work. Copyright owners 
have 
the 
right 
to 
control 
the 
reproduction of their work, including 
the right to receive the royalty payment 
for that reproduction. © is copyright 
symbol.
	 Cracking : Activity such as decipher 
codes or passwords and breaking  
security systems for illegal reasons is 
called cracking. The cracker will use 
a program or script known as a crack 
that has been written specifically to 
do what they're hoping to achieve.
	 Cyberbully or Cyberstalking : 
Cyberstalking is a criminal practice 
where an individual uses the Internet 
to systematically harass or threaten 
someone. This crime can be perpetrated 
through email, social media, chat 
rooms, instant messaging client and 
any other online medium.
	 Phishing : This a technique of 
extracting confidential information 
such as credit card numbers and 
username 
password 
combos 
by 
pretending as a legal enterprise. 
Phishing is typically carried out by 
email spoofing. 
	 Plagarism  : Plagarism is presenting 
someone else's work or idea as your 
own without their consent. The 
widespread use of computers and the 
advent of the internent has made it 
easier to palagiarize the work of 
others. For example plagarism is 
found in document such as essay, 
reports etc.
 	 Hacking 
: 
Hacking 
refers 
to 
unauthorised intrusion into a computer 
or a network. Hacker is a person 
intensely interested in the deep and 
hidden or concealed working of any 
computer 
operating 
system 
and 
programming language. They might 
discover loopholes within systems 
and reasons for such loopholes. 
Protecting Ourselves From 
Cyber Crime :
4.4 Cyber Safety and Security
Cyber safety is the safe and responsible 
use of information and communication 
technology. It is not just about keeping 
information safe and secure, but also 
about being responsible with  that 
information, being respectful of other 
people online, and practising good 
'netiquette' (internet etiquette). In recent 
years,   all systems are exposed to Internet; 
hence there is increased challenge in 
maintaining and protecting them from 
the attackers.
Any organisation plays a key role in 
promoting internet safety. They are 
primarily  responsible  for  keeping

Security Procedures
		 Encryption : It is a method of 
converting the original message 
into random text, which should be 
complex to understand and difficult 
for a hacker to decode. The idea is 
to ensure security and safety of data 
and its transmission.
		 SSL (Secure Socket Layer) : It is 
the most consistent security model. 
Through the SSL, transmission of 
data is encrypted, client-server 
information is authenticated and 
also message integrity for TCP/IP 
connections secured.
		 Firewall : Firewall refers to network  
security (Hardware and Software) 
system which blocks certain type of 
information, forming a barrier 
between a trusted and untrusted 
network. It attempts to block the 
spread of computer attacks.
Don'ts : 
1.	 Don't share your personal information: 
real name, date of birth, phone number 
etc. unnecessarily.
2.	 Don't send your pictures to unknown 
persons or share them on social media.
3.	 Don't open emails and attachments 
from strangers.
4.	 Don't respond to any suspicious email, 
instant message or web page asking 
for personal information.
5.	 Don't share your password/OTP with 
anyone.
6.	 Don't save your username and 
password on the browser. 
7.	 Don't steal other's information.
8.	 Don't access or use files without the 
permission of the owner.
9.	 Don't copy software which has 
copyright 
without 
the 
author's  
permission.
10.	Don't bully others online by teasing, 
threatening, using rude or offensive 
language, making derogatory or 
hateful comments.
11.	Don't meet unknown (even if they are 
known only through online interaction) 
people alone; always inform an adult 
or a friend.
12.	Don't 
open 
or 
download 
any 
attachments from an unknown  source 
as they may be harmful. 
Parental guidance :
A lot of cybercrimes revolve around 
unsuspecting 
teenagers 
and 
school 
children. Parents play a vital role in 
ensuring that their children are safe on 
the internet and not vulnerable to hackers 
and identity theft. To start with, treat 
confidential information as confidential. 
Never reveal sensitive data on the internet. 
Tell children not to give out personal 
information like address or telephone 
number or Facebook password to friends. 
Ensure, children don't do that as vital 
information should be kept secret.

Fake Call Frauds
Several instances have occurred 
wherein people receive phone calls that 
appear to be from their bank. The caller 
usually pretends to be a bank presentative 
or someone from the bank's technical 
team. In most cases, the caller sounds 
professional and provides a convincing 
reason for calling the customer. After 
giving a false sense of security, the caller 
then tricks the victim into giving away 
their  personal and confidential data such 
as :
	 One-Time-Password (OTP), Credit/
debit card number, The card's CVV 
number, Expiry date, Secure password, 
ATM pin,  Internet Banking login ID 
and password and other personal 
information
With all such crucial information at 
hand, the fraudster can easily carry out 
illegal financial transactions using the 
victim's name.

In this SOP we are going to learn GIMP, Inkscape
GIMP
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) was created in 1995 as a computer sci­
ence project by students, Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis. Today GIMP has become 
a very sophisticated software with plenty of documentation and support. GIMP is a 
Free and Open Source Software. You can freely distribute the program as well as its 
source code to any number of users. You can even study the source code and enhance 
it. GIMP runs on Linux and most of the other desktop Operating Systems.

Digital Content Creation (GIMP, Inkscape)

97
Gimp Opening Screen  (The appearance may vary depending upon your version)
GNU/Linux distribution already comes with a GIMP package. Installing through 
package manager is a preferred method of installing GIMP, as the distribution main­
tainers take care of all the dependencies and bug fix updates. 
GIMP is very easy to learn. The opening screen of 
GIMP is shown above. Please ensure that you use 
the 'Single Window Mode' which is suitable for 
beginners. To do this,  tick  Windows -> Single-
Window Mode if it is not ticked already.
GIMP toolbox contains set of tools. These tools can be used 
to do various operations on images. Tool icons visually describe 
the corresponding operations. We will cover a few of them.
Students are required to explore the other tools by using 
them and referring to the GIMP documentation, manual and 
web tutorials which are freely available.
The most frequently used  tool is Foreground 
and Background colour tool. The upper rectangle 
represents foreground colour while the lower 
represents background. 
Clicking on each of the rectangles gives a colour selection dialog from which users 
can choose required forground or background color. Note that each colour selection is 
represented by set of numbers. You can note down these numbers and reproduce the 
colour at any time. 
Let us do a small activity. We will create a colourful baloon with some text on it. 
Step 1 : Create a blank image, also called as 'Canvas'. File->New (or Ctrl+N).
Fig 2 : Single Window Mode Option
Fig 3 : GIMP Toolbox
Fig 4 : Canvas Creation

98
We start with a new blank  image of size 640 x 400 pixels. The new image will 
have white background and black foreground.
This 640 x 400 image will be the surface of our baloon.
We want our baloon to have very attractive colours. So let us fill the whole image 
area with some bright colour. We can use single flat colour or even mixture of few col­
ours. Here we will use gradient colour. Gradient colour is a gradually fading mixture 
of two colours
Step 2 : Change Foreground and Background colour with colours of your 
choice. The tool will show you the colours you have chosen in the form of 
small icon.
Fig 5 : Colour Toolbox
Step 3 : Now select the Blend Tool ( short cut L )  from the tool box and drag the 
mouse from left to right on your canvas. After you release the mouse, the canvas will 
be filled by the gradient of foreground and background colour. The baloon made up 
of this canvas will look nice. But we will decorate the canvas further by putting some 
text and coloured ovals on it.
Fig 6 : Gradient Color

99
Step 4 : Next click on Text tool ( short cut  T ) The resulting dialog will give you 
various options to change font, font size, colour of the font etc. You can type text in the 
language of your choice provided that additional languages are added in Region and 
Language Settings of your Linux Distribution. You can refer QR Code to install 
Marathi Font.
Step 5 :  After you are satisfied with the font, size and other attribute, press escape. 
Note that a new layer is created with the text you entered. As you add various objects 
like text,graphics,drawings etc to your image, new layers are created. This enables 
you to selectively move the objects and change their colour, size etc. Later you can 
merge down these layers into your main image.
Step 6 : Using move tool, we can move the text roughly to the centre of the image but 
instead we prefer to put it precisely in the centre, using the Align Tool. Click on Align 
Tool ( short cut Q )  and then select the Text layer and text. In the Align dialog, Select 
relative to image and click on Vertical Centre and then Horizontal Centre buttons. The 
text layer should now occupy the exact centre of the image.
Step 7 : Drawing coloured oval (Ellipse) : Change the background and foreground 
colours again with two different colours. We have chosen Red and Yellow respectively.
Create a new layer in your image. Now click on the Ellipse select tool (short cut E) 
and select the oval shaped area on the image. It will not have any colour.  Use the 
menu Edit->'Fill with FG colour' to give Red colour to your oval. Similarly draw 
another one and fill with BG color. 
Step 8 : Using move tool place these ovals near the Text. Do not move them too far 
from the center or they will go to the rear side of the baloon. Select the layers one by 
one and merge them using the command Layer->Merge Down. We now have a colourful 
single layer. Let us create a baloon from this canvas.

Step 9 : Do Filters->Map->Map Object. Select Map to Sphere, Check 'Update preview 
live' and Uncheck the 'Transparent Background'. This will give you a dialog showing 
the preview of the resulting balloon (sphere)
Press Ok and the image will now turn into nice 
balloon with 3D effect. 
The balloon is little elongated since our canvas 
was rectangular.

                                                                                     Fig 9 : Map to Object Tool
Fig 10 : Output for Step 9

101
Step 10 : We will tweak the balloon further and give it more realistic shape. Apply the 
Distort Filter with Curve Bend option. That is Filter->Distort-> Curve Bend. In the 
resulting dialog choose Automatic preview and Lower curve border. Then drag the 
Mid point of the Curve Indicator line using the mouse :
Press Ok and you will get a nice colourful balloon with 3D effect.
Step 11 : Let us remove the unwanted portion around the balloon. To do this simply 
do Image-> Crop to content.
Fig 11 : Curve Bend filter Option
Fig 12 : Output for Step 10

102
Step 12 : Finally export the image to PNG (jpg format does not support transparency) 
You can use this balloon as the object to other images. Open an image where you want 
to insert the balloon.
Fig 13 : Output after cropping
Fig 14 : Image for Step 12

103
File -> Open -> Image ->As Layer. Then move the balloon layer to the desired location 
and merge the balloon layer to the original image. Note that the transparent part is not 
visible. All images are rectangular in shape. Due to transparency our image appears to 
have balloon like shape.
Fig 15 : Output for Step 12

104
Inkscape 
Inkscape is a free and open source software for creating vector images. 
Vector Images are stored as drawing rules and not as a set of pixels. 
Whenever we resize a vector  image, the image is redrawn using the rules.  
Hence the resized images have the same quality as that of original images.
The image rules or descriptions are stored in xml format with the 
extension SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Inkscape is primarily used for diagrams, 
charts, graphs, illustrations, logos, icons, line arts, user interfaces of softwares etc.
Inkscape is availble on all major desktop operating systems. It is included in official 
repositories of all major Linux distributions. One can easily install it from package 
manager like Synaptic.
Fig 16 : Inkscape Opening Screen

105
The opening screen gives you a toolbar on the left. On the top you have a tool 
control bar. When a tool is selected, this bar shows various settings for the currently 
selected tool. The right side is reserved for additional dialogs such as fill and stroke 
align and distribute etc.
We will draw simple objects in order to learn basic skills using the given tools. 
We use only geometric shapes such as line, circle, ellipse, rectangle and square for 
these drawings. You might already have used similar tools in many other drawing and 
painting softwares. But Inkscape gives you far better control than most of the other 
softwares.
Circle/Ellipse Tool :
Let us start with Circle or Ellipse tool. 
1) 	Select the tool button from left tool bar showing circle icon. 
2) 	Drag it with the mouse to any place in the client area. You will 
get a circle or an ellipse from starting point to the end point where 
you release the mouse button. To get the exact circle, press the Ctrl 
key while dragging. This will guide you by snapping to the exact 
square.  
3) 	After the ellipse is complete choose the selection tool (topmost from the left tool 
bar). Then click on the ellipse. The ellipse will then show 8 size handles. You can 
resize the ellipse by dragging these handles. Also clicking once again on it will turn 
the sizing handles to rotation handles. You can toggle between Size and Rotation 
handles.
Fill Colour in the object :
To fill the ellipse with colour, just click on any desired colour given in the bottom 
colour palette. 
To choose  more precise and accurate colours, use the menu Object - Fill and 
Stroke. This will give a dialog with a few tabs and also Red, Green and Blue (RGB) 
colour options. You can choose any combination of Red, Green and Blue to obtain very 
precise colour from it. Note that you have 0 to 255 that is total 256 choices for each 
of Red, Green and Blue so total 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216  colours can be chosen.

106
Duplicate the object :
Using duplicate, you will get an exact copy of the object. Using Edit-Duplicate 
(Shortcut Ctrl-d) you get exact copy of the same object. The duplicate will be at the 
same place so you need to move it in order to make the duplicate object visible.  
Activity :
Draw different sized ellipses, fill them with colour, rotate and then 
move and position them in order to draw a simple object as shown 
below . Our example object is an animal made up of ellipses.  A 
squirrel is shown using only ellipse. We have applied duplication 
of objects, colouring, rotation and order of objects at appropriate 
places. You can draw any other animal using simple objects.
Objects may overlap each other. This order of Objects can be changed by using menu 
Object -> Raise to Top, Lower to Bottom.
To draw line segments, use Bezier tool. After selecting the tool, click at starting 
point and drag with mouse to draw line , double click to finish the segment at desired 
point. Now to increase the line width, click on menu Object -> 'Fill and Stroke',   while 
the line segment is selected. In the 'Stroke Style' tab, adjust the width.
To change the stroke paint, go to stroke paint tab in the same dialog and choose 
the desired colour. You may have to press shift at the time you click on colour in 
order to apply it. To draw a vertical or horizontal segment with precision, keep Ctrl key 
pressed during the drawing. This will correct the angle in steps of 15 deg as you move 
closer to the angle.
Using the node tool, transform the drawn segment into a 
curve. Select the tool and stretch (drag) the  middle part 
of the segment. It will turn into  a curve
Let us fill this curve with a colour. It is very simple. Just select the 
object (curve in our case). Ensure that 8 sizing handles are surrounded 
by the object. Then click on the required colour. We have chosen 
Green colour. This will fill the region under the curve.
Now we draw a circle or ellipse. You are already familiar with this. Pick this 
tool from the left tool box and drag it on the canvas with left mouse button. 
Rlease the mouse button after you get the desired size of the ellipse. To 
produce exact circle, keep the ctrl button pressed. In the same way, 
rectangles or squares are drawn. We also draw two small ovals and fill 
them with a suitable colour.

107
We will draw another curve by stretching the line segment 
downwards.  Fill it with some colour and join these two curves. 
Bring together these shapes to form a simple basic human figure. 
You need to select and move them in order to put them at proper 
places. You can use Edit->Duplicate (Shortcut Ctrl+d)  for pair of 
feet.. Also use rotate handles to rotate the object. Sizing handles are 
converted to rotate handles on click and vice versa. 
Here is another example. A small bird with colourful wings, 
tail, beak and legs. All the components are geometric shapes 
that are joined together. Legs and Wings can be drawn and 
duplicated.
The adjacent diagram shows the drawing components 
used to make bird.
Gradient in Inkscape :
Let us now learn another concept in colouring, the Gradient. Gradient is a gradual 
mixture of colours. Gradients are used to give special effects to paintings. Gradients 
look attractive. They often give a kind of depth to the shapes. 
Activity to draw a staircase :
1) 	Draw a parallelogram using beziar tool. Ensure that the last node will coincide 
with the first. This will make the region closed.
2) 	Now choose a plane colour to fill this region. We have chosen red. Go to menu 
Object->Fill and Stroke. Ensure that the region is filled with proper colour and the 
Fill tab is selected.
3) 	Finally click on Gradient tab. The region is now filled with red gradient slowly 
fading towards the other end with white colour. This is the upper surface of a 
staircase step. 
4) 	Duplicate this object and move a little down words to get the bottom surface.

108
5) 	Next draw another paralelogram of appropriate size for the front surface. Fill this 
surface with Green Gradient.
6) 	We do not require the rear surface. A small edge may be drawn instead to indicate 
the rear surface of the step block.
7) 	Join all components. Completed single staircase block is shown in the adjacent 
figure. 
8) 	Finally take multiple copies of this block and make a staircase object.
Always ensure that the desired color is filled in the region of the 
object before selecting gradient tab.
When duplicate is created it will be placed just above the original 
object. Select and move it immediately from its place to avoid 
multiple copies one below the other. This will unnecessarily 
increase the size of the image.
Palette gives only the standard set of colours. You can use Fill and Stroke dialog 
and RGB model tab to adjust the colour with more accuracy. There are CMYK and 
other models to select the colour. Study of colour models is beyond the scope of this 
text book. Students are encouraged to study this advance topic.
Activity to draw a simple flower :
1)	 Draw one elongated ellipse. This is a petal of our flower.
2) 	Fill with pink colour.
3) 	Click on it to get sizing handles. Again click it to get rotation handles. Look 
carefully at the center of the ellipse. There you will find the center of rotation. If 
you try to rotate this petal using the handle, it will rotate around this center. We will 
move this center to left corner. To do this just drag it with mouse.
4) 	Now duplicate the petal (Ctrl+D). This operation will also copy the new location 

109
of the center. Now if you rotate the petal. It will move along its corner like needles 
of the clock.	
5)	 Duplicate and move these petals successively to get complete
round of petals resulting into a flower.	
6)	 We can decorate the flower further by adding colourful center.
Draw a circle. Fill it with a bright colour, say red. In the fill
and stroke dialog, increase the stroke width in stroke style tab.
Choose a different stroke paint, we have chosen yellow. Now
move this circle to the center of the flower.		
7)	 Finally, we attach a stem to our flower. There is a calligraphy
tool. This tool a used to write stylish text. This is a kind of
angled pen. As you change the direction of the stroke, the
width of the stroke changes. Draw a smooth curved stroke as
shown. Also draw two ellipses for leafs. Give green colour to
these objects. Use duplicate the leaf and use flap command to
avoid repetitive work.	
8)	 The completed flower is shown in the adjacent picture.
Gradients can also be used to colour the petals. You can see
in another example, the petals are coloured with yellow and
orange color gradients. Try to draw different  flowers and find
out more tools that can be used for creating flowers.
Activity to draw Star and Polygon :
The next tool that we are going to try is Star and Polygon tool. 
1)	 Open this tool. You can switch between star and polygon by the buttons given in
this tool's settings.
2)	 Drag Stars or Polygons of various sizes. One fascinating thing about star tool is
that the underlined algorithm can produce different design patterns as you change
basic parameters which create the star. Try experimenting on number of corners,
spoke ratio and rounded setting.

110
Corners : 9
Corners : 16
Corners : 24
Corners : 24
Spoke Ratio : 0.608 Rounded : 0.050
Randomized : 0.128
Spoke Ratio : 0.560
Rounded : 5.010
Rounded : 4.600
Rounded : 5.010
Rounded : 6.990
Activity to draw a Snail :
Just below the star tool, there is spiral tool which can be used to 
draw the spirals of all sizes and styles. You can set number of turns 
and also the other parameters. Let us use spiral object to draw an 
interesting object, a snail. The shell of a snail has spiral pattern. 
1)	
Draw a spiral and increase the stroke width.
2)	 Draw ellipse for body of the snail and use appropriate tools for other parts.
3)	 Draw traingle as a tail, small circles as eyes, rectangle & filled circel as antenna
of the snail.
Activity to draw a Car :  
We will now take a look at the Simplify path command. This command gives 
smootness to the curve. The edges or corners are removed and replaced by smooth 
curve. It is a recurring process, that is you can give the command Path -> Simplify 
(Shortcut Ctrl + L)  repeatedly till you get the desired result. 
As an activity, let us draw a simple car object using bezier 
segments.  

111
	 1) 	 Using Bezier tool, draw an outline of a car by 
using a series of segments. Close the outline by 
choosing the first node as last node. 
	 2) 	 Now select the car outline and press Ctl+L 
(Shortcut for Path -> Simplify. Corner nodes 
will slowly turn into curves. You can stop when 
desired seamless shape is obtained. In case you 
go ahead and smooth it more than required, you 
can always press Ctrl+Z (undo) 
3) 	After you get the outline in good proportion,colour the car.
4) 	Create two wheels (circles) with thick stroke.
5) 	Give appropriate fill and stroke colour.
6) 	You may draw some strips to represent street.  You may need to order the object 
using Object -> Raise to Top, Lower to Bottom.
Activity : Move the mouse pointer on the toolbar and identify the tools. Make a list.

Installing GNU/Linux (Ubuntu) - An Important Skill for Digital Literacy 
We will now install Ubuntu 18.04. Installation skill is often required in everyday 
life as your computer sometimes gets formatted or your hard disk may  crash.  We will 
learn three different methods of creating an installer. Students are required to learn all 
of them.
	 1. 	 Creating Installation DVD of GNU/Linux
	
	 GNU/Linux distribution comes as an ISO image file. An ISO image file is an 
image of a CD or DVD which is stored as a usual binary file on disk. From the 
respective Linux distributions website, download the installation ISO file 
(Image). We will download Ubuntu 18.04 desktop 64 bit ISO image from 
Ubuntu official website www.ubuntu.com.
	
	 The easiest way to make an installation DVD is to Right Click on the iso file 
from your file manager. Most probably your current OS would have image burn­
ing feature built-in. If it shows burn image options menu then you can insert 
blank DVD in the DVD drive and burn the image straight away. 
	
	 If you are using an old operating system, you might have to use separate image 
burning software. Few free and open source DVD burners are Infra Recorder, 
cdrtfe, DVD Flick, DVDStyler, Burn and also many more are available. Install 
one of these softwares and burn the Installation DVD.  
	
	 You can also create a GNU/Linux Installation USB disk as given in the following 
paragraph which is the most preferred method.
Creating GNU/Linux Live USB Installer (Recommended Method)
Burning DVD from ISO is perhaps the simplest way to create GNU/Linux 
installer but there are certain disadvantages of this method. DVD has a short shelf life. 
If the disk has even a small read error it becomes useless.  Active GNU/Linux 
distributions are updated regularly. Every few months, new improved versions keep 
coming with new features and security updates. Hence your installer DVD will 
become obsolete in a few months. Also, read/write speed of DVD is far less than USB. 
Hence it will take a long time to install. On the other hand, USB is much faster if you 
want to run GNU/Linux live session without installation. The Read Only DVD is 
wasted in case of any error during the writing process. But USB disk can be formatted 
and reused once the installation is finished. Thus USB can reduce e-waste to some 
extent.
  Step For Installing Linux OS

120
Creating Live installation USB is also easy. Let us learn this skill now. We 
assume that you have Ubuntu 18.04 ISO file stored in your disk. The method is the 
same for all other distributions. You can very well install them with this method.
There are a many free and open source tools that can be used to create such USB 
installer disk. We will show here two such tools namely Rufus and Etcher. We will 
also show how to use one of the advance disk duplicator tool dd. Do try other tools, 
if you like, and compare them with the tools given here.
	 1. 	 Rufus : Rufus (Pronounced as ROO-Fuss) has General Public License (GPL). It 
means that you are free to distribute and even modify Rufus software to suit your 
needs. The source code is available in public repositories.
The advantage of Rufus is that it is very small in size (about 1 mb). Also Rufus 
is a portable software. It means that you can Rufus from the executable file without 
installing it. So go and download Rufus from its website. Plug the usb disk (at least 4 
GB). Start Rufus by double-clicking on the downloaded file. In the device menu, you 
can see your USB name. In boot selection menu select the downloaded ISO file. Most 
of the other entries will be filled automatically once you load the iso file.  Accept these 
defaults and click on the start button. You may be asked permission to download sys­
tem file syslinux. Click okay.  In a newer version, this dialog may not appear. 
Next, you will be shown hybrid image dialog. Leave defaults and click on okay. 
In rare cases, if the hybrid image method does not work, you have the option of dd im­
age method. We will also learn this method separately in the last section. 
Finally, you will be warned that all the data on the disk will be destroyed. If you 
have not already taken the backup of the data on the disk, you can cancel the process 
and copy the data from the disk to a safe place. Otherwise, the press continues to start 
the process. It will take about 3 to 8 minutes depending upon the read/write speed of 
your USB disk. The indicator will tell you the progress status. Once the process is over 
the ready message will appear. You can now close the application and eject your USB 
disk. Using this Live USB, you can install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on any desktop or laptop.

121
	 2. 	 Etcher : Etcher is a cross-platform free and open source utility distributed under 
Apache license. Etcher is very easy to use. To download etcher. first, plug in your 
USB drive. Then start Etcher. 
	
	 Now there are only three natural steps needed to make boot-able pen drive :
	
	 1) Select Image  2) Select  Drive 3) Flash
In the first step select downloaded iso image from the disk. In the next step, select 
this as your target USB drive (if it is not selected by default). 
In the last step, select flash to start the process. Once the process is over your 
USB disk is ready as Linux Installer.
Fig. 2 : Etcher USB creator
	 3. 	 dd Command (Quick Advanced Method) : Our last utility "dd command" is an 
advanced method which is applicable only for GNU/Linux distributions. This 
method is useful if you have already installed Linux on one of the machines and 
you would like to create USB installer. The advantage of dd command is that it 
is a one-line command. With just one line, the USB installer is created. Moreover, 
the command is always available in all GNU/Linux distribution. dd Stands for 
Data Duplicator. It is an internal command for all GNU/Linux distributions.
Please use dd command with care, preferably under the guidance of your teacher 
or you may accidentally format the hard disk of your computer.
Step 1 : 	 First, go to the terminal by using terminal menu or press Ctrl + Alt +T. 
(The shortcut may be different). Plug in your USB disk. 
Step 2 : 	 Find out the drive letter by giving the $lsblk command. 
Most probably sda will be the letter for hard disk and sdb will be your USB drive 
letter. Confirm again by carefully examining the output. Ignore the partition letters, if 
any, like sda1, sda2, sdb1 etc. The volume label will confirm your drive letter and also 
the size. It will be little less than 4 GB for a 4 GB disk. (3.7 G in the adjacent picture).
Step 3 : 	 Once you confirm the drive letter you can go and give the dd command. It is 
assumed that you have kept the ISO image in the default home folder where 
the terminal is opened by default.

122
Step 4 : 	 Make USB boot-able using dd command 
	
$sudo dd bs=4M if=  "Ubuntu 18.04.iso" of=/dev/sdb  status=progress
	
Enter the Admin password when asked. The terminal will show process 
indicator in percentage (as shown in fig 3). 
Step 5 : 	 Once this process is over, do not be in a hurry to take out USB. You must 
flush the output buffer by the command 
$sync :
That's it. Wait for sync to finish. Your USB GNU/Linux installer is ready.
Installing GNU/Linux (Ubuntu)
The first step before installing Ubuntu is taking a backup. Copy all the important 
file to an external hard drive. Make sure to not miss any files. Installing GNU/Linux 
involves formatting your hard drive. This means all the data on the hard drive will be 
deleted. You can copy the files back once you have installed GNU/Linux. 
Once the backup is done, remove your backup drive, and insert your Installation 
USB/DVD that you created in the previous section. Now restart your computer. In 
order to start the installation, you need to access the boot menu/BIOS/UEFI. This is 
different on every computer. Steps for various vendors are given below. 
Generally, you can press the [DEL] key, [F2] key, [F10] key, or the [F12] key 
while the computer is turning on. This has to be done right after you press the power 
button. Look up for the correct method to do this for your computer. 
You should now be on a blue background menu. Use the keyboard to navigate. 
You need to make sure of the following things :
	  	 Secure Boot is disabled
	  	 Boot Mode is Legacy/BIOS and not UEFI
	  	 Your installation DVD/USB has the highest boot priority.
Once that is done, choose the save and reboot option. You should now be in the 
Ubuntu Installer (as shown in fig. 4). Choose "Try before installing" using the keyboard 
and press Enter.
Fig. 3 : Output of 'ISblk' command

123
 
Once your desktop loads, you can explore the system.  To start the installation, 
double-click on the "Install Ubuntu 18.04" icon on the desktop. 
It will ask what language and keyboard layout you have (as shown in Fig. 5). Keep 
those as default. You can choose "English - India" if you want the (Rupee) symbol, 
among other things.
Next, it will ask if you want to connect to WiFi. Click on "I don't want to connect 
to WiFi right now." If you connect to WiFi you can choose to download updates from 
the internet while installing, but that significantly increases the installation time. Click 
on next.
The next menu is "Updates and other software" (as shown in Fig. 5). Check the 
"Install third party software" box. This will allow you to view movie DVDs, etc. Un-
check the "Download updates while installing Ubuntu". You can install updates after 
you have installed Ubuntu. 
Fig. 4 : Ubuntu Installation welcome screen
Fig. 5 : Ubuntu Installation Keyboard layout selection

124
Also, choose "Normal installation". This will take more space, but includes a 
large amount of software. Again, click on next.
Now, click "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" and click on "Install now" (as shown in 
fig. 7). 
Ubuntu will give you a Summary of the changes it is going to make. Click on 
"Write change the disk" to confirm (as shown in fig. 8).
Fig. 6 : Ubuntu Installation Updates
Fig. 7 : Ubuntu Installation Types

125
Before installing, Ubuntu will ask for your user information. First is your time­
zone. In India, the IST (Indian Standard Time) is used. The (as shown in fig. 9) city for 
IST is Kolkata.
Choose that and click on next, then input your Name, Computer name, Username, 
and Password. And finally, click on "Install now." (as shown in fig. 10)
Fig. 8 : Ubuntu Disk Partition confirmation screen
Fig. 9 : Ubuntu Timezone setting screen

126
The installation will take 30 min to 1hour.
After its done, Ubuntu will ask you if you want to restart your computer. Click on 
"Restart now", and remove the DVD/USB when it will you to do so. You should now 
have Ubuntu installed on your computer.

127
You can install Libre Office suite from its official website for free of cost :
http://www.libreoffice.org
It is available for various operating systems.
For GNU/Linux Operating System :
As a general rule, you are advised to install LibreOffice via the installation 
methods recommended by your particular Linux distribution (such as the Ubuntu 
Software Center, in the case of Ubuntu Linux). This is because it is usually the 
simplest way to obtain an installation that is optimally integrated into your system. 
Indeed, LibreOffice may already be installed by default with your Linux operating 
system. 
In short, you will be able to download LibreOffice packages tailored to your 
system's packaging standard (RPM or deb), or even get a .tar.gz archive for Libre 
Office. You will then need to install these packages, first the main LibreOffice 
binaries, then the additional components such as language packs and built-in help.
Just follow the instructions provided by the wizard and install Libreoffice. 
For Windows Operating System :
Download
If you are unsure which Windows version you have, press  Win+Pause to open 
your system properties window. The LibreOffice Main Installer download page can be 
selected with a built-in help file for your language :
	 	 Click here for the 32-bit version.
	 	 Click here for the 64-bit version.
Click the green button with white writing which says "DOWNLOAD VERSION". 
If the download does not automatically begin, click 'Save File'. You are invited to 
give an optional donation.
Install
Open the folder where the Main Installer has been downloaded and double-click 
on the Installer.
Welcome
The Installation Wizard Welcome dialog box opens it and advises that the 
installation process is about to be started. Click on "Next >"
  Step For Installing Libre Office

128
Setup Type
Another dialog box opens, giving you a choice whether you want a default instal­
lation, or whether you want to choose special locations and components. If you want 
a default installation, just press "Next >". If you want to make special choices, click 
on "Custom" and then press "Next >".
Custom Setup
The Custom Setup enables changes to the features that will be installed.
If you would like to install the spelling dictionaries, hyphenation rules, thesauri 
and grammar checkers :
	 	 Click   Optional Components
	 	 Click   Dictionaries
Once all required changes to the features have been completed, click on "Next >"
File Type
Another dialog box opens, inviting you to choose whether to open Microsoft 
Office documents with LibreOffice. By default, this feature is not enabled. If you want 
LibreOffice to open Microsoft Office files (documents, spreadsheets and 
presentations), put a checkmark in all four checkboxes. Click on "Next >"
Shortcut and Load during system startup
Another dialog box opens, asking you whether :
	 	 A shortcut to open Libre Office should be placed on your desktop. The default 
option is to create a shortcut.
	 	 To load LibreOffice during system start-up.
After your selection press "Install".
Libre Office is Installing
If the User Account Control dialog shows, click on "Yes" to continue the 
installation.
LibreOffice Installation Completed
Click "Finish".
