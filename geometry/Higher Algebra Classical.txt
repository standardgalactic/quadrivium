INEQUALITIES 
1.1. Introduction. 
Throughout this chapter we are concerned with real numbers only. 
When two real numbers are not equal, a relation of inequality is said 
to exist between them. The property of trichotomy in the set of all real 
numbers states that any two real numbers a, b must satisfy one and only 
one of the following relations-
(i) 
a is equal to b 
(a= b), 
(ii) 
a is greater than b (a> b), 
(iii) 
a is less than b 
(a< b). 
The last two relations are inequality relations. 
Therefore, if a be a real number different from 0, one of the following 
inequality relations must hold-
(i) a > 0, 
(ii) a < 0. 
When a > 0, a is said to be positive; when a < 0, a is said to be 
negative. 
We define a > b if a - b > 0, and 
a < b if a - b < 0. 
The relations a > b and b < a state the same inequality relation, since 
a> 0 ~-a< 0. 
The symbol a > 
b means a is greater than or equal to b; 
a < b means a is less than or equal to b. 
For example, if a is a real number then a2 > O; 
if a is a positive real number then a2 > 0. 
1.2. Properties. 
If a, b, c be real numbers, then 
(i) 
a > b and b > e =? a > e, 
(ii) 
a > b =? a+ e > b + e, 
(iii) 
a> band e > 0 =? ae > be, 
(iv) 
a > b and e < 0 =? ae < be, 
( v) 
a > b and e = 0 =? ae = be.

HIGHER ALGEBRA 
Proof. ( i) a - c = ( a - b) + ( b - c) 
> 0, since a - b > 0 and b - e > 0. 
Therefore a > c. 
(ii) (a+ c) - (b + c) = a - b 
> 0, since a > b. 
Therefore a + c > b + c. 
(iii) ac - be= (a - b)e 
> 0, since a - b > 0 and e > 0. 
Therefore ae > be. 
(iv) ae - be= (a - b)e 
< 0, since a - b > 0 and e < 0. 
Therefore ae < be. 
(v) obvious. 
Corollary. 
(i) a> band b > c =>a> e, 
(ii) 
a > b and b > e => a > e, 
(iii) 
a > b => a + e > b + c, 
(iv) 
a > b and e > 0 => ae > be, 
( v) 
a > b and c < 0 => ac < be. 
Theorem 1.2.1. If ai, a2, . . . , an; bi, b2, ... , bn be all real numbers such 
that ai > bi for i = 1, 2, ... , n, then 
ai + a2 + · · · + an > bi + b2 + · · · + bn. 
Proof. (ai + a2 +· · ·+an) - (bi + b2 + · · · + bn) 
= ( ai - bi) + ( a2 - b2) + · · · + ( an - bn) 
> 
0, since ai - bi> 0 for i = 1,2, ... ,n. 
Therefore ai + a2 +···+an > bi + b2 + · · · + bn. 
Theorem 1.2.2. If ai, a2, ... , an; bi, b2, ... , bn be all positive real mun-
hers such that ai > bi for i = 1, 2, ... , n, then 
aia2 .. . an > bib2 ... bn. 
Proof. aia2 - bib2 = ai (a2 - b2) + b2(ai - bi) 
> 0, since each term is positive. 
Therefore aia2 > bib2. 
Thus ai > bi and a2 > b2 => aia2 > bib2. 
Similarly, aia2 > b1b2 and a3 > b3 => a1a2a3 > b1b2b3• 
Successive applications give a1 a2 .. . an > b1 b2 ... bn. 
Note. The theorem does not hold if the numbers be not all positive. 
For example, 5 > -2 and 2 > -10 but 5.2 < (-2).(-10).

Theorem 1.2.3. If a, b be positive real numbers with a > b, and n be a 
positive integer, then an > bn. 
Proof. The theorem holds for n = 1. 
Let us assume that the theorem holds for a positive integer, say m. 
Then am> bm. 
Now am> bm > 0 and a> b > 0:::::} am+l > bm+1. 
This shows that the theorem holds for n = m + l if it holds for n = m. 
And the theorem holds for n = I. 
By the principle of induction, the theorem holds for all positive inte-
gers n. 
Note. If a, b are real numbers with a > band n is a positive integer, it 
does not necessarily follow that an > bn. 
For example, 2 > -3 implies (2) 2 < (-3)2 , but 2 > -1 implies 
(2)2 > (-1 )2. 
Theorem 1.2.4. If a> b > 0 and n be a negative integer, then an < bn. 
Proof. Let n = -m. Then mis a positive integer.

b-a . 0 .

d b

a - b = ab < ' since - a < 
an a > . 
Therefore ¼ < ¼. 
Since mis a positive integer and O < ¼ < ¼, (¼)m < ( ¼ )m, by the 
previous theorem. 
Therefore a-m < b-m, i.e., an< bn. 
Theorem 1.2.5. Ha> b > 0 and n be a rational number, then an> or 
< bn according as n is positive or negative. 
Proof When n is an integer, positive or negative, the theorem reduces 
to the theorems 1.2.3 and 1.2.4. 
Case I. Let n be a positive fraction and n = ! , where p, q are positive 
integers prime to each other and q =I= I. 
Let us consider two positive numbers al/q and b1fq, where a1fq de-
notes the positive qth root of the positive number a. (Such a positive 
root always exists, since a is positive.) 
We assert that a1fq > b1fq. Because, a1fq < b1fq :::::} (a1fq)q < 
(b1fq)q => a < b, a contradiction. 
Since pis a positive integer, a1fq > b1fq :::::} (a1fq)p > (b1fq)P, i.e., 
an> bn.

Case II. Let n be negative fraction and n = -m where m is positive.

This completes the proof. 
Worked Examples. 
1. If a, b, c be all real numbers, prove that a2 + b2 + c2 > ab + be + ca. 
a2 + b2 + c2 -
( ab + be + ca) = ½ ( a - b) 2 + ( b - c) 2 + ( c - a) 2 > 0, 
since each term is non-negative. 
Therefore a2 + b2 + c2 > ab+ be+ ca, the equality occurs when 
a= b = c. 
2. If a, b, c be all positive real numbers, prove that

Therefore 2(a2 + b2) >(a+ b)2 , the equality occurs when a= b

Hence a+b + b+c + c+a

The equality occurs when a = b = c. 
3. If a, b, c, d be all real numbers greater than 1, prove that 
(a+ l)(b + l)(c + l)(d + 1) < B(abcd + 1). 
(a - l)(b - 1) > 0 since a - 1 > 0, b - 1 > 0 
or, ab + l > a + b 
or, 2 ( ab + l) > ab + 1 + a + b = ( a + l) (b + 1). 
Therefore (a+ l)(b + 1) < 2(ab + 1) ......... (i) 
Similarly, (c + l)(d + 1) < 2(cd + 1) ......... (ii) 
ab> 1, cd > 1. Using (i), we have 
(ab+ l)(cd + 1) < 2(abcd + 1) ......... (iii) 
Hence (a+ l)(b + l)(c+ l)(d + 1) < 4(ab + l)(cd + 1), by (i) and (ii); 
and 4(ab + l)(cd + 1) < B(abcd + 1), by (iii) 
Therefore (a+ l)(b + l)(c + l)(d + 1) < B(abcd + 1).

4. If a, b, c be all positive real numbers and n be a positive rational 
number, prove that 
an(a - b)(a - c) + bn(b - a)(b - c) + cn(c - a)(c - b) > 0. 
Case 1. Let a = b = c. 
L.H.S.= 0, since each term is 0. 
Case 2. Let two of a, b, c be equal. a= b, say. 
L.H.S.= cn(c - a)2 > 0, since c > 0, (c - a) 2 > 0. 
Case 3. No two of a, b, c are equal. 
Without loss of generality, let a > b > c. 
Then a - b > 0, b - c > 0, a - c > 0. 
an(a - b)(a - c) + bn(b - a)(b - c) = (a - b)[an(a - c) - bn(b - c)]. 
a > b > c =} a - -~
b - c > 0 and a > b > 0 =} an > bn, since n > 0. 
Therefore an(a - c) > bn(b - c), by Theorem 1.2.2. 
Hence an(a - b)(a - c) + bn(b - a)(b - c) > 0. 
Also we have cn(c - a)(c - b) > 0. 
Therefore an(a - b)(a - c) + bn(b - a)(b - c) + cn(c - a)(c - b) > 0. 
Combining all cases, we have 
an(a - b)(a - c) + bn(b- a)(b- c) + cn(c - a)(c - b) > 0, the equality 
occurs when a= b = c. 
1.3. Standard inequalities. 
1. Weierstrass inequalities. 
If a 1, a2 , . .. , an are all positive real numbers less than 1 and Sn = 
a1 + a2 +···+an, then 
1 -
Sn < 
{1 - a1)(l - a2) ... (l - an) < 1)sn 
and 
1 + Sn < {1 + a1)(l + a2) ... (l + an) < 1!sn, 
provided in the last inequality it is assumed that Sn < 1. 
Proof. (1 - a1)(1 - a2) = 1 - (a1 + a2) + a1a2 
> 1 - (a1 + a2). 
(1 - a1)(1 - a2)(1 - a3) > [1 - (a1 + a2)](l - a3), since 1 - a3 > 0 
> 1 - (a1 + a2 + a3). 
Successive applications give 
(1 - a1)(l - a2) ... (l - an) > 1 - (a1 + a2 +···+an) 
i.e., > 
1 -
Sn, 
In the same manner, (1 + ai)(l + a2) ... (l + an) > 1 + Sn,

The ordered array of n real numbers a1 , a2, ... , an is denoted by 
(a1, a2, .. . , an). Let (a) = (a1, a2, ... , an), (b) = (b1, b2, ... , bn). Then 
(a) = (b) if ai = bi for i = 1, 2, .. . , n. The ordered arrays (a) and (b) are 
said to be proportional if there exists a non-zero real number k such that 
ai = kbi for i = 1,2, ... ,n. 
For example, (1, 1, 2, 0, -1) and (2, 2, 4, 0, -2) are proportional. 
2. Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 
If a1 , a2, ... , an; b1, b2, ... , bn be all real numbers, then 
( a 1 2 + a2 2 + · · · + an 2) ( b1 2 + b2 2 + · · · + bn 2) > ( a 1 b1 + a2 b2 + · · · + an bn) 2, 
the equality occurs when 
either (i) 
ai = 0 for i = 1, 2, ... , n; or bi = 0 for i = 1, 2, ... , n; or both 
ai = 0 and bi = 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n; 
or (ii) 
ai = kbi for some non-zero real k, i = 1, 2, ... , n. 

INEQUALITIES 
7 
Proof. Case I. If ai = 0 for i = 1, 2, ... , n; or bi = O for i = 1, 2, ... , n; 
or both ai = 0 and bi = 0 for i = 1, 2, ... , n; then the equality holds 
each side being zero. 
' 
Case II. Let not all of ai and not all of bi be zero. 
Sub-case (i). Let ai = kbi for some non zero real k, i = 1, 2, ... , n. 
Then ( a12+a22 + · · ·+an 2) (b12+b22 + · · · + bn 2) = k2 ( b1 2 + b/ + · .. + bn 2) 2 
and (a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn)2 = k2(b12 + b22 + .. . + bn 2)2. 
Therefore the equality holds in this sub-case. 
Sub-case (ii). Let (a1, a2, ... , an) and (b1, b2, ... , bn) be not proportional. 
Let us consider the expression 
(a1 - ,\b1)2 + (a2 - .Xb2)2 +···+(an - ,\bn)2, where,\ is real. 
For all real ,\, the expression > 0. The equality occurs only when 
a1 -
-Xb1 = 0, a2 - Ab2 = 0, · · · , an - ,\bn = 0 
i.e., when (a1, a2, . .. , an) = ,\(b1, b2, . .. , bn) 
i.e., when (a1, a2, ... , an) and (b1, b2, ... , bn) are proportional. 
Therefore, in this sub-case (a1 --Xb1)2+(a2-Ab2)2+· · ·+(an -,\bn)2 > 
0 for all real ,\, 
or, (a12 + a22 + · · · + an2) - 2,\(a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn) + ,\2(b12 + 
b2 2 + .. · + bn 2) > 0 
or, B,\2 - 2C,\ + A > 0, where A = a12 + a22 + · · · + an 2, 
B = 
b12 + b-i2 + • • • + bn2, 
C = a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn. 
The roots of the equation Bx2 - 2Cx +A= 0 must be imaginary, 
because otherwise, there would exist some real ,\ for which the equality 
B,\2 - 2C,\ +A= O would hold, a contradiction. 
Therefore AB > C 2 
or, (a12 + a22 +··•+an 2)(b12 + b22 + · · · + bn 2) > (a1b1 +a2b2 + · · · + 
anbn)2. 
This completes the proof. 
Note. In particular, if a1, a2, ... , an; b1, b2, ... , bn be all positive real 
numbers, then 
(a12+a22+- • •+an 2)(b12 +b22+· · ·+bn 2) > (a1b1 +a2b2+· · ·+anbn)2, 
the equality occurs if ri = f = · · : = t ·

Let us consider ordered triplets (1, 1, 1) and ( J3a + 1, J3b + 1, J3c + 1). 
By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, 
( J3a + 1 + J3b + 1 + J3c + 1)2 ~ (1 + 1 + 1)[(3a+ 1) + (3b+ 1) + (3c+l)]

Proof. Case 1. Let p, q have the same sign. Let i and j be any two 
of the numbers 1, 2, ... , n. Since p, q are of the same sign, aiP - ajP and 
aiq - al are both positive or both negative or both zero.

Case 2. Let p, q have opposite signs. Then aiP - ajP and aiq - ajq have

Therefore (aiP - ajP)(aiq - al) < 0. 
Proceeding with similar arguments as in case 1, we can prove

Let us consider the case when n is not a power of 2. Then 2m-l < 
n < 2m for some positive integer m > 1. In this case there exists a 
positive integer p such that n + p = 2m. 
Let us consider n + p positive numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, a, a, ... , a where

Proof. Case 1. Let m > 1. 
Since a> 0 and =/= l, am > O and =/= l. 
Let us consider two unequal positive numbers am and 1 with associ-
ated positive rational weights 1 and m - 1 respectively. 
Then 1.am+;:i-1).1 > [am.1]1/m 
or, am + m - 1 > ma

Case 2. Let O < m < l.

Case 3. Let m < 0. Then 1 - m > 1. 
Since a> 0 and =/= l, ¼ > 0 and =/= l. 
By Case 1, (¼)l-m - 1 > (1- m)(¼ -1) 
or am - 1 > (1 - m) l-a

This completes the proof.

2. COMPLEX NUMBERS 
2.1. Introduction. 
It follows from the properties of real numbers that the square of a 
real number is never negative. Consequently, the elementary quadratic 
equation x2 + 1 = 0 has no solution in the system of real numbers. 
Introduction of a new type of numbers, called complex numbers, has 
made it possible to provide solutions of the equation x2 + 1 = 0 and also 
of the more general type of equations 
aoxn + a1xn-l +·· · +an= 0, 
where ao, a1, ... , an are real numbers. 
2.2. Complex numbers. 
Definition. A complex number z is defined to be an ordered pair of real 
numbers (a, b) that satisfies the following condition (i) and the following 
laws of operations (ii) and (iii) 
(i) 
(a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a= c, b = d (condition of equality) 
(ii) 
(a, b) + (c, d) = (a+ c, b + d) (definition of addition) 
(iii) 
(a, b).(c, d) = (ac - bd, ad+ be) (definition of multiplication). 
Of the ordered pair ( a, b), the first component a is said to be the real 
part of z and is denoted by Rl z and the second component b is said to 
be the imaginary part of z and is denoted by Im z. 
Theorem 2.2.1. Addition of complex numbers is commutative. 
This says that if z1, z2 be complex numbers then z1 + z2 = z2 + z1. 
Proof. Let zi = (a1, b1), z2 = (a2, b2), 
Then z1 + z2 = (a1 + a2, b1 + b2), z2 + z1 = (a2 + a1, b2 + bi). 
But a 1 + a2 = a2 + a 1 , b1 + b2 = b2 +bi, since addition of real numbers 
Is commutative. 
Therefore zi + z2 = z2 + z1. 
Theorem 2.2.2. Addition of complex numbers is associative. 
This says that if zi, z2, z3 be complex numbers then 

38 
HIGHER ALGEBRA 
(z1 + z2) + Z3 = z1 + (z2 + Z3). 
Proof. Let z1 = (a1,b1), z2 = (a2,b2),za = (a3,b3). 
Then z1 + z2 = (a1 + a2, b1 + b2), z2 + Z3 = (a2 + a3, b2 + ba), 
(z1 + z2) + z3 = [(a1 + a2) + a3, (b1 + b2) + ba, 
z1 + (z2 + za) = [a1 + (a2 + a3), b1 + (b2 + b3)]. 
But (a1 + a2) + a3 = a1 + (a2 + a3), (b1 + b2) + ba = b1 + (b2 + b3), 
since addition of real numbers is associative. 
Therefore (z1 + z2) + z3 = z1 + (z2 + z3). 
Theorem 2.2.3. Multiplication of complex numbers is commutative. 
This says that if z1 , z2 be complex numbers then z1 .z2 = z2 ,z1. 
Proof. Let z1 = (a1, b1), z2 = (a2, b2). 
Then z1.z2 = (a1a2 - b1b2, a1b2 + b1a2) 
z2z1 = (a2a1 - b2b1, a2b1 + b2a1)-
But a1 a2 = a2a1, b1 b2 = b2b1, a1 b2 = b2a1, b1 a2 = a2b1, since multi-
plication of real numbers is commutative. 
Therefore a1a2 - b1b2 = a2a1 - b2b1, a1b2 + b1a2 = a2b1 + b2a1, since 
addition of real numbers is commutative. 
Therefore z1.z2 = z2.z1. 
Theorem 2.2.4. Multiplication of complex numbers is associative. 
This says that if z1, z2, z3 be complex numbers then (z1.z2).z3 = 
z1.(z2.z3). 
Proof. Left to the reader. 
Theorem 2.2.5. If z1, z2, Z3 be complex numbers then 
Z1.(z2 + z3) = Z1.Z2 + Z1,Z3. 
Proof. Let z1 = (a1, b1), z2 = (a2, b2), Z3 = (a3, b3). 
Then z1.(z2 + za) = (a1, b1).(a2 + a3, b2 + b3) 
= [a1 (a2 + a3) - b1 (b2 + ba), a1 (b2 + ba) + b1 (a2 + a3)] 
= [(a1a2 - b1b2) + (a1a3 - b1ba), (a1b2 + b1a2) + (a1b3 + b1a3)] 
= (a1a2 - b1b2, a1b2 + b1a2) + (a1a3 - b1b3, a1b3 + b1a3) 
= (a1, b1).(a2, b2) + (a1, b1).(a3, b3) 
= z1.z2 + z1.z3.

COMPLEX NUMBERS 
The complex number (1, 0) satisfies the property -
(a, b).(l, 0) = (a, b) for all complex numbers (a, b). 
( 1, 0) is said to be the unit complex number and is denoted by 1. 
39 
Negative of a complex number zi, denoted by - zi, is defined to be a 
complex number z2 such that zi + z2 = 0. 
Let zi = (ai, bi), z2 = (a2, b2). 
zi + z2 = 0 
⇒ (ai + a2, bi+ b2) = (0, 0) 
⇒ ai + a2 = 0, bi + b2 = 0 
⇒ a2 = -ai, b2 = -bi. 
Therefore z2 = (-ai, -bi). 
Thus -(ai, bi)= (-ai, -bi). 
Subtraction. Let zi, z2 be two complex numbers. zi - z2 is defined to 
be the complex number z1 + (-z2). 
Thus (a1, bi) - (a2, b2) 
(a1, bi)+ [-(a2, b2)] 
(a1, b1) + (-a2, -b2) 
(a1 - a2, b1 - b2). 
Multiplicative inverse of a non-zero complex number z1, denoted by 
z11, is defined to be a complex number z2 such that z1. z2 = 1. 
Multiplicative inverse of the zero complex number is not defined. 
Let z1 = (a1, b1), z2 = (a2, b2). 
Then z1.z2 = I 
⇒ (a1a2 - bib2, a1b2 + a2b1) = (1, 0) 
⇒ a1a2 - b1b2 = I, a1b2 + a2b1 = 0.

Theorem 2.2.6. If the product of two complex numbers be zero then

HIGHER ALGEBRA 
Proof. Let z1 = (a1, b1), z2 = (a2, b2 ) be two complex numbers such that 
Z1Z2 = 0. 
Then (a1a2 - b1b2, a1b2 + b1a2) = (0, 0). 
Therefore a1a2 - b1b2 = 0 ...... (i) 
a1b2 + b1a2 = 0 ...... (ii) 
Let z2 I 0. 
Then a22 + b2
2 =I 0. 
Multiplying (i) by a2 and (ii) by b2 and adding, we have 
a1 (a2 2 + b22) = 0. 
Multiplying (i) by b2 and (ii) by a2 and subtracting, we have 
b1 ( a2 2 + b2 2) = 0. 
Consequently, a 1 = b1 = 0. Thus z2 =I 0 =} z1 = 0. 
By similar arguments, z1 =I= 0 =} z2 = 0. 
The complex numbers of the form (a, 0) having imaginary part Oare 
of special interest. For such complex numbers 
(a1, 0) + (a2, 0) = (a1 + a2, 0) and (a1, 0).(a2, 0) = (a1a2, 0). 
It is evident that the operations of addition and multiplication for 
such complex numbers take the form of arithmetic addition and multi-
plication for real numbers. 
The complex number (a, 0) is identified with the real number a. vVe 
write a= (a, 0). In particular, 0 = (0, 0). 
The complex numbers of the form (0, b) having the real part 0 and the 
imaginary part non-zero are of special interest. Such a complex number 
is said to be an imaginary number. For such complex numbers 
(0, b1) + (0, b2) = (0, b1 + b2) and 
(0, b1).(0, b2) = (-b1b2, 0). 
The sum of two imaginary numbers is imaginary and the product of 
two such numbers is real. 
In particular, the complex number (0, 1) is said to be the imaginary 
unit and it is denoted by i. 
Thus i.i = (0, 1).(0, 1) = (-1, 0) = -1. 
Also (0, b) = (0, l).(b, 0) = (b, 0).(0, l). 
Hence (0, b) can be expressed as ib or bi. 
2.3. Normal form. 
The complex number (a, b) can be expressed as (a, b) = (a 0) + (0, b). 
Again, (0, b) = (0, l).(b, 0) = (b, 0).(0, 1). 
' 
Therefore (a, b) = (a, 0) + (0, 1).(b, 0) = (a, O) + (b, 0).(0, 1) 

COMPLEX NUMBERS 
41 
= a + ib or a + bi. 
Since (a,b)+(c,d) = (a+c,b+d),(a+bi)+(c+di) = (a+c)+(b+d)i. 
Since (a, b).(c, d) = (ac - bd, ad+ be), (a+ bi).(c + di) = (ac - bd) + 
(ad+ bc)i. 
It is observed that the sum and the product of two complex numbers 
a + bi and c + di take the same form as the sum and the product of two 
real binomials a+ bi and c + di (treating i as real) if we take care always 
to replace i2 by -1. 
For example, (2 + 3i).(3 + i) = (2.3 - 3.1) + (2.1 + 3.3)i 
= 3 + lli, by definition. 
The ordinary multiplication gives 
(2 + 3i).(3 + i) = 2.3 + 2.i + 3.3i + 3i2 
= 6 + lli - 3 = 3 + lli. 
The quotient ~t~~ where (c, d) -=j; (0, 0) can be computed as 
a+bi _ 
(a+bi)(c-di) 
_ (ac+bd)+(-ad+bc)i _ ac+bd + -ad+bc .

2.4. Geometrical representation. 
Just as real numbers are represented as points on a line, complex 
numbers (which are also ordered pairs of real numbers) can be represented 
as points on a plane. 
With respect to a given rectangular co-ordinate system in a plane, 
the complex number z = a + bi can be represented by the point with 
co-ordinates ( a, b). 
The first co-ordinate axis is called the real axis and the second co-
ordinate axis is called the imaginary axis. 
The plane in which this representation is made is said to be the com-
plex plane, or the Gaussian plane, after the name of Gauss, a celebrated 
German mathematician. 
The origin represents the zero complex number. The points on the 
real axis represent all real numbers of the form ( a, 0) and the points on the 
imaginary axis, other than the origin, represent all imaginary numbers 
of the form (0, b). 
2.5. Conjugate of a complex number. 
Let z =a+ bi be a complex number. The conjugate of z, denoted by 
z, is defined to be the complex number a - bi. 
Thus z == a - bi when z = a + bi. 
Geometrically, the point z is the reflection of the point z in the real axis

2.6. Modulus of a complex number. 
Let z =a+ bi be a complex number. The non-negative real number 
✓ 
a2 + b2 is said to be the absolute value or the modulus of z and ~ 
denoted by I z I, or mod z, or mod (a+ bi). 
Geometrically, mod z is the distance of the point z from the origin 
in the complex plane. In general, I z1 - z2 I is the distance between the 
points z1 and z2 . It is also evident from the definition that 
I z1 - z2 l=I (a1 - a2) + (b1 - b2)i I = ✓(a1 - a2)2 + (b1 - b2)2. 
Since I z I is a real number, the statement / z1 I>/ z2 I has a meaning. 
But the statements like z1 > z2, z1 < z2 have no meaning unless z1, z2 
are purely real. 
It follows from definition that l z I= I z /. 
Also zz =(a+ bi)(a - bi)= a2 + b2 =/ z j2 . 
Theorem 2.6.1. The modulus of the product of two complex numbe~ 
is the product of their moduli.

Theorem 2.6.2. The modulus of the quotient of two complex numbers

Theorem 2.6.3. (i) I z I> (Rl z), the equality occurs when z is a 
non-negative real number.

Theorem 2.6.4. Triangle inequality. 
If z1 , z2 be two complex numbers, then / z1 + z2 I</ z1 I + I z2 /, the 
equality occurs if (i) one or both of z1 , z2 be zero, 
or (ii) ~ is a positive real number.

<I z1 /2 + / z2 12 +2 I z1 I/ z2 /, since / z2 l=I z2 I

Therefore / z1 + z2 /</ z 1 I + I z2 I, since I z1 + z2 I, I z1 I, I z2 I are 
each non-negative. The equality occurs when z1z2 is real and > 0. 
i.e., when either (i) one or both of z1 , z2 be zero

2. 7. Polar form. 
Let z = a+ bi be a complex number. In the complex plane z is 
represented by the point whose Cartesian co-ordinates are ( a, b) referred 
to two perpendicular lines as axes, the first co-ordinate axis being called 
the real axis and the second the imaginary axis. 
Taking the origin as the pole and the real axis as the initial line, let 
( r, 0) be the polar co-ordinates of the point ( a, b). Then a = r cos 0, b = 
r sin 0. 
Geometrically, r is the distance of the point ( a, b) from the origin. r 
is said to be the modulus of the complex number z. 
For every point other than the origin, r > 0. For the point (0, 0), 
r = 0. Thus every non-zero complex number has a positive modulus. 
0 is the angle made by the radius vector through the point ( a, b) with 
the real axis. 0 is called an argument or an amplitude of z. 
0 cannot be determined for the zero complex number. 
Consequently, a non-zero complex number z is represented in the form 
z = r ( cos 0 + i sin 0). 
This is called the polar form or modulus-amplitude form of the com-
plex number z. 
As 0 is indeterminate for the zero complex number, the zero complex 
number has no polar representation. 
For a non-zero complex number z, 0 has infinitely many values dif-
fering from one another by a multiple of 21r. 
If z = r( cos 0 + i sin 0), r is determined from the relations r cos 0 = 
a, r sin 0 = b giving r = ✓a2 + b2 and 0 is determined from the relations 
cos 0 = £, sin 0 = Q. 
r 
r 
All values of 0 are expressed as Arg z ( or Amp z). If a be a value of () 
satisfying the relations cos 0 =£, sin0 =Q then Arg z (Amp z) = a+2n1r, 
r 
r 
n being an integer. 
The principal argument (amplitude) of z, denoted by arg z (amp z), 
is defined to be the angle 0 which satisfies the inequality -1r < 0 < 1r. 
For example, 3; is an argument of the complex number -i but it is 
not the principal argument because 0( = 3;) does not satisfy the relation 
~1r < 0 < 1r. The principal argument of -i is -; and Arg (-i) = 
T + 2n1r, or - i + 2m1r, where n and m are integers. 
Note. An argument of the complex nu1nber a+ bi is to be determined 
from the relations cos 0 = 53:, sin 0 = !!. simultaneously and not from the

Proof Let z1 = r1(cos 01 + i sin 01), z2 = r2(cos 02 + i sin 02). 
z1z2 = r1r2[(cos 01cos 02-sin 01sin 02) + i (cos 01sin 02+sin 01cos 02)]

This shows that 01 + 02 is an argument of z1 z2. 
Note. The theorem does not hold, in general, if the principal arguments

-1r < 01 < 1r, -1r < 02 < 1r. Then arg z1 = 01, arg z2 = 02. 
z1z2 = r1r2[cos (01 + 02) + i sin (01 + 02)]. 
01 + 02 is argument of z1z2. But 01 + 02 may not be the principal

arg (z1z2) = 01 + 02 + 2k1r where k is an integer such that -1r < 
01 + 02 + 2k1r < 1r. But -21r < 01 + 02 < 21r.

Three cases arise.

Theorem 2.8.1. De Moivre's theorem 
When n is an integer, positive or negative, and 0 is a real number 
( COS 0 + i sin 0)n =COS n0 + i sin n0; 
when n is a fraction, positive or negative, and 0 is a real number 
cos n0 + i sin n0 is one of the values of ( cos 0 + i sin or. 
Proof Case I. Let n be a positive integer. 
The theorem holds for n = l, since (cos +i sin 0) 1 = cos B+i sin 0 = 
cos 10 + i sin 10. 
Let us assume that the theorem holds for n = m , where m is a positive 
integer. 
Then (cos 0 + i sin 0)m =cos m0 + i sin m0. 
Therefore (cos 0 + i sin 0)m+l = (cos m0 + i sin m0)(cos 0 + i sin 0) 
= (cos m0cos 0-sin m0sin 0) + i(cos m0sin 0+sin m0cos 0) 
=cos (m + 1)0 + i sin (m + 1)0. 
This shows that the theorem holds for n = m + l if we assume it to 
hold for n = m. And the theorem holds for n = l.

Case 3. Let n be a fraction, positive or negative. 
Let n = p / q where p, q are integers and q > l , p may be positive or

Since (cos I!!!.. --1- i sin I!!!.. )q =cos p0 + i sin p0, by case 1 
q 
q

i.e., cos n0 + i sin n0 is one of the values of ( cos 0 + i sin 0)n. 
Corollary. When n is a positive or a negative integer and 0 is a real 
number 
(cos 0 - i sin 0)n =cos n0 - i sin n0; 
when n is a fraction and 0 is a real number 
( cos n0 - i sin n0) is one of the values of ( cos 0 - i sin 0)n. 
This follows from the relation 
(cos 0 + i sin 0)-1 =cos (-0) + i sin (-0) =cos 0 - i sin 0. 
Note. The generalised form of De Moivre's theorem states that if n be a

Proof. Let z = r(cos 0 + i sin 0), where r > 0, -7r < O < 7r. 
Let z1/n = w = p(cos </> + i sin <f>). 
. • 
This implies wn = z and therefore Pn ( cos nc/J + i sin n</)) = r( cos 0,. 
i sin 0). 
This gives pn cos n</> = r cos 0 and pn sin n</> = r sin 0 • 
We have pn = r, i.e., p = efr where ::fr is the positive nth root of r; 
and n<j) = 0 + 2k1r, where k is an integer. Therefore ¢ = 
2
k:+
0
. 
Hence w = efr ( cos 2k:+0 + i sin 2k1;t0 ) , where k is an integer. 
For different values of k, we get different values of wand this suggests 
that there are infinitely many values of z1fn. 
We now prove that these are not all distinct. 
Let Zm denote the value of w corresponding to k = m, i.e., Zm::: 
y'r(cos 2m;+0 + i sin 2m:+0 ). 
We prove that only n values zo, z1, . .. , Zn-1 are distinct and every 
other value of w (as k runs through all other integers) takes one of these 
distinct values. 
To prove that zo, z1, ... , Zn-1 are distinct, let us assume the contrary 
that zp = zq where O < p < n - 1, 0 < q < n - I and p > q.

That is, p~g is an integer, which is a possibility only when p = q, 
since p - q < n. This proves our assertion. 
Let Zt be any value of w where t is other than 0, 1, ... , n - l . 
By division algorithm there exist integers ,\ and µ such that t = n.X+µ, 
where O < µ < n - 1. 
Therefore Zt = y'r( cos 2t1r+9 + i sin 2t1r+0)

Note 2. The value corresponding to k = O is called the principal nth 
root of z. The principal nth root of z is yr(cos ! + i sin !), where 
r =mod z, 0 =arg z (principal argument). 
Theorem 2.9.2. If z is a non-zero complex number and m, n are positive 
integers prime to each other, then (z1/n)m = (zm)l/n. 
Proof. Let z = r ( cos 0 + i sin 0), where -1r < 0 < 1r. Then 
(z1ln)m = ( yr)m[cos 2k:+o + i sin 2k:+0 ]m, where k = 0, I, ... ,n -1 
= ( yr)m[(cos ! + i sin !)wk]m, where w = cos 2: + i sin 2:

= ( efrm[cos ":i0 + i sin ":i8 ]wk, where w = cos 2; + i sin 2: 
and k = 0, I, ... , n - I. 
Since m and n are prime to each other, the numbers 0, m, 2m, ... , 
(n - l)m when divided by n, leave the remainders 0, 1, 2, ... , n - l in 
some order. Therefore as k runs through the values 0, 1, 2, ... , n - l, the 
two sets of values of wkm and wk are same. 
Therefore (z1ln)m = (z~)I/n. 
Note 1. The n numbers in either set are the values of zm/n. 
Therefore zm/n = efrm[cos (2k7r:O)m + i sin (2k7r:O)m] 
= y'rm(cos [(2k1r+0)1;:] +i sin [(2k1r+0)7;]), where k = 0, l, ... ,n-l. 
Note 2. If z is a non-zero complex number and m, n are positive integers 
prime to each other, then z-';: = (¼) ':: = [(¼)m]-¼ = (z-m)¼. 
Also z- 1: = ( ¼) 7: = [ ( ¼) fi] m = ( z-¼ ) m. 
Note 3. If z is a non-zero complex number and m, n are positive integers, 
then (z1/n)m =/ (zm)Ifn, in general. 
For example, let z = i, m = 4, n = 6. Then

These have three distinct values. 
Theorem 2.9.3. If z is a non-zero c01nplex number and p, q, 1n, n are 
positive integers where P. = m with gcd(m, n) = 1, then zP/q = zm/n. 
q 
n 
Proof. Here np = qm. Let w = zP/q. Then w = (z1fq)P, by definition. 
wn = {(zlfq)p}n = (zlfq)Pn = (zlfq)qm = { (zlfq)q}m = zm. 

54 
HIGHER ALGEBRA 
Therefore w = (zm)I/n = (z1fn)m, since gcd(m, n) = 1 
= zm/n. 
Therefore zP/q = zm/n. 
This completes the proof. 
Note. The theorem gives a method for evaluating zP/q, where p, q are 
positive integers not prime to each other . 
. zP/q = (z* )m = (zm)l/n, where ! = 7;;: and m, n are positive integers 
pnme to each other. 
For example, ii= (ii)4, by definition. [art. 2.8] 
And also i!= i~ = (i½)2= (i2)½, by the theorem. 
It follows that i ! has three distinct values. 
It is worthwhile to note that ( i4) ½ has six distinct values. 
2.10. nth roots of unity. 
When the complex number is 1, the roots are of special interest. They 
are called the nth roots of unity.

Let us denote cos 2

are wk, where k = 0, 1, ... , n - 1. 
So the roots are 1, w, w2, ... , wn-l. 
Let z be an arbitrary non-zero complex number r( cos 0 + i sin 0), 
where -1r < 0 < 1r. 
Then nth roots of z are 
ffe(cos 2k:+e + i sin 2k:+0), where k = 0, 1, . .. , n - 1. 
= ffe( cos ! + i sin ! ) ( cos 2~1r + i sin 2~1r) 
= ffe(cos ! + i sin !)wk 
= z0wk where zo = y'r(cos ! + i sin !), the principal nth root of z. 
Thus all the nth roots of z can be expressed as zo, zow, z0w2, ... , 
z0wn-l and they can be obtained by multiplying then nth roots of unity 
by the principal nth root of z. 
Note. If vz denote the principal square root of z then the square roots

If ffe denote the principal cube root of z then the cube roots of z a.re

converges for all x and the sum is denoted by e · e 18 a 
ction of 
real variable x defined for all x. This is called the exponential functio~ 
of a real variable x. 
For a complex variable z = x + iy, the exponential function of 
written as exp z, is defined by exp(x + iy) = ex(cos Y + i sin y). 
z, 
This definition agrees with the real exponential function when z is 
purely real. 
When z is purely real, y = O and exp z = ex(cos O + i sin 0), i.e. , 
exp x = ex. 
. 
When z is purely imaginary, x = 0 and exp z = (cos y + i sin Y), 
1.e., exp(iy) = cos y + i sin y. 
Since ex > O for all real x, ex ( cos y + i sin y) represents a complex 
number in polar form, ex being the modulus and y being an amplitude 
of exp z. 
Since ex =I=- 0 for any real number x, exp z is a non-zero complex 
number for any complex number z. 
Let u + iv be a non-zero complex number and let its polar represen-
tation be r(cos 0 + i sin 0). Since r is positive, log r is real and r can 
be expressed as r = e10g r. 
Therefore u + iv = 
e10g r ( cos 0 + i sin 0) 
exp (log r + i0). 
Thus when u + iv is a given non-zero complex number, there exists 
a complex number z = log r + i0 such that exp z = u + iv. This means 
that the range of the exponential function of z is the entire complex plane 
excluding the origin. 
Properties. 
1. exp z1.exp z2 =exp(z1 + z2), where z1, z2 are complex numbers. 
Proof Let z1 = X1 + iy1, z2 = x2 + iy2• 
Then z1 + z2 = (x1 + x2) + i(Y1 + Y2). 
exp z1 = ex1 (cos Y1 + i sin Y1),exp z2 = ex2 (cos y2 + i sin y2),

• exp z2 
Proof. Since exp z2 is a non-zero complex number exp zi is defined. 
. 
. 
' exp z2 
Let z1 = x1 + iy1, z2 = X2 + iy2. 
Then z1 - z2 = (x1 - x2) + i(y1 - Y2). 
exp z1 = ex1 ( cos Y1 + i s\n Y1) ,exp z2 = ex2 ( cos y2 + i sin y2 ).

exp(z1 - z2). 
Corollary. ex! z = exp(-z). 
This follows from the property since exp ( 0) = 1 
3. If n be an integer, (exp z)n = exp(nz). 
67 
This follows from the property 1 and the relation ( exp z )-1 = 
exp(-z). 
Note. If 0 be real and n be an integer, it follows that ( exp i0) n = exp in0, 
i.e., (cos0 + isin0)n = cos n0 + isin n0. This is De Moivre's theorem. 
4. If n be an fraction say p/q, (exp z)n has q distinct values but exp(nz ) 
is unique. In this case, exp(nz) is one of the values of (exp z)n. 
Note. If 0 be real and n be a fraction, it follows that ( exp in0) is one 
of the values of (expi0)n, i.e., cosn0 + isinn0 is one of the values of 
( cos 0 + i sin 0) n. 
5. If n be an integer, exp(z + 2n1ri) = exp z. 
This follows from the property 1 and the relation exp(2n1ri) = 1. 
This states that exponential function is periodic with period 21ri. 
Note. A complex function f is said to be a periodic function on its 
domain D c (C if there exists a non-zero constant w such that for all 
integers n, f(z + nw) = J(z) (*) holds for all z E D. If no submultiple 
of w satisfies the relation (*), then w is said to be the period off. 
Let w be a non-zero complex number. Then there always exists a 
complex number z such that exp z = w. 
By the property 5, exp z = w => exp(z + 2n1ri) = w, where n is an 
integer. 
Thus for a non-zero complex number w there exist infinitely 1nany 
complex numbers z such that exp z = w.

2. Find all complex numbers z such that exp z = -1. 
Let z = x + iy. 
Then exp z = -1 implies ex(cos y + i sin y) = -1. 
Therefore ex cos y = -1, ex sin y = 0. 
We have ex= 1 and cosy= -1,sin y = 0. 
ex= l => x = 0, 
cos y = -1 and sin y = 0 => y = (2n + l}rr, where n is an integer. 
Therefore z = (2n + l)n-i. 
3. Find all complex numbers z such that exp(2z + 1) = i. 
Let z = x + iy. 
Then 2z + 1 = (2x + 1) + i2y. 
exp(2z + 1) = i implies e2x+1(cos 2y + i sin 2y) = i. 

COMPLEX NUMBERS 
Therefore e2x+l cos 2y = 0, e2x+l sin 2y = l. 
We have e2x+l = 1 and cos 2y = 0,sin 2y = 1. 
e2x+ 1 = 1 => X = -½' 
69 
cos 2y = 0 and sin 2y = 1 => y = (4n + l)f, where n is an integer. 
Therefore z = -½ + (4n + l)fi. 
4. Solve exp z = 1 + \/'3i. 
Let z = x--+ iy. 
Then exp z = 1 + v'3i implies ex ( cos y + i sin y) = I + \f'3i. 
Therefore ex cos y = I, ex sin y = v'3. 
We have ex= 2 and cosy= ½,sin y = {!'. 
These determine x = log 2 and y = 2n1r + J, where n is an integer. 
Therefore z = log 2 + (2n1r + J )i. 
2.13. Logarithmic function. 
Let z be a non-zero complex number. Then there always exists a 
complex number w such that exp w = z. 
w is said to be a logarithm of z. 
Again exp w = exp(w + 2n1ri), where n is an integer. This shows 
that if w is a logarithm of z, then w + 2n1ri is also a logarithm of z. 
This means that "logarithm of z" is a many-valued function of z. 
This is denoted by Log z = w + 2n1ri. 
Of the many values of logarithm of z, a particular one is called the 
principal logarithm of z and is denoted by log z. 
Since z is a non-zero complex number, z has a polar representation. 
Let z = r(cos 0 + i sin 0), -1r < 0 < 1r (a polar form with amp z). 
Let w = u + iv be a logarithm of z. Then exp w = z. This gives 
eu(cos v + i sin v) = r(cos (} + i sin 0). 
Therefore eu cos v = r cos 0, eu sin v = r sin 0. 
We have eu =rand cos v = cos 0, sin v = sin 0. 
These determine u = log rand v = 0 + 2n1r, where n is an integer. 
Therefore w = log r + i(0 + 2n1r), -1r < 0 < 1r 
i.e., Log z = log r + i(0 + 2n1r) 
= log I z I +i(arg z + 2n1r). 
The principal logarithm of z, denoted by log z, corresponds ton= 0. 
Therefore log z 
log r + i0, -1r < 0 < 1r 
= 
log I z I +i arg z.

Note 1. Log z has been expressed as Log z = log r + i0 + 2n1ri, Wh 
() is the principal argument of z and n is an integer. 
ere 
An equivalent expresion is Log z = log r + ia + 2p1ri, where o is 
argument of z and pis an integer, since a= 2m1r + 0 for some integer a:, 
The difference in these two expressions is to be noted. 
The first expression gives the p.v. of Log z(i.e., log z) when n ::::-: 0 
but the latter does not give log z when p = 0. 
' 
Therefore in order to find log z (the p.v. of Log z) we shall necessarij 
stick to the polar representation of z with principal argument. 
y 
Note 2. From the definition of Log z it follows that 
(i) 
exp(Log z) = z for all z f= 0 
and 
(ii) 
one of the values of Log(exp z) is z, the other values being 
z + 2n1ri, n being a non-zero integer. 
The principal logarithmic function is the inverse function of the 
exponential function and 
(i) exp (log z)=z for all z f= O; and (ii) log (exp z)=z for all z EC. 
Worked Examples.

z = - l, 
(iii) 
z = 'l' 
( i V) 
z = -'l. 
(i) 
1 = 1( cos O + i sin 0). (polar form with principal argument) 
Log 1 = log 1 + i(O + 2nrr), where n is an integer. 
Therefore Log 1 = 2nrr and log 1 = 0. ( corresponding to n = 0) 
(ii) -1 = 1 ( cos 1r + i sin 1r). 
Log(-1) = log 1 + i(rr + 2nrr), where n is an integer. 
Therefore Log (-1) = (2n + l)1ri and log (-1) = 1ri. (corresponding 
ton= 0) 
(iii) 
i = 1 ( cos ; + i sin ; ) . 
Log i = log 1 + i(J + 2n1r), where n is an integer. 
Therefore Log i = (4n + 1); i and log i = ; i. 
(iv) -i = l[cos 2-rr + i sin 21rJ. 
Log(-i) = log 1 + i( 21r + 2n1r), where n is an integer. 
Therefore Log{ -i) = ( 4n - 1); i and log( -i) = -,ti. 
Note that Log(-i) can also be expressed as ( 3; + 2n1r )i. 

COMPLEX NUMBERS

2. Express Log(x + iy), (x, y) # (0, 0), in the form A+ iB where A and 
B are real and find log(x + iy). 
Since x + iy is a non-zero complex number, it has a polar representa-
tion. Let x + iy = r(cos 0 + i sin 0), -1r < 0 < 1r. 
Then r =mod(x + iy) and 0 = arg(x + iy) (principal argument). 
Let Log(x + iy) = u + iv. 
Then exp(u + iv) = x + iy = r(cos 0 + i sin 0) 
or, eu(cos v + i sin v) = r(cos 0 + i sin 0). 
This gives eu cos v = r cos 0, 
eu sin v = r sin 0. 
We have f 2u = r2 => eu = r => u = log r = ½ log(x2 + y2). 
Since eu = r, we have cos v = cos 0, sin v = sin 0. 
Therefore v = 0 + 2n1r, where n is an integer. 
Hence Log(x + iy) = u +iv= ½ log(x2 + y2) + i(0 + 2n1r). 
Therefore A= ½ log(x2 + y2) and B = 0 + 2n1r =Arg(x + iy). 
The principal logarithm of x + iy corresponds ton= 0 (since 0 is the 
principal argument). 
Hence log(x + iy) = ½ log(x2 + y2) + i arg(x + iy). 
3. Find Log z and log z, where z = l +i tan 0, i < 0 < 1r. 
Let z = r(cos ¢ + i sin ¢) 
Then r cos ¢ = 1, r sin ¢=tan 0. 
We have r2 = sec2 0 and this gives r = - sec 0 since sec 0 < 0. 
Therefore cos ¢ = - cos 0 and sin ¢ = - sin 0. 
These determine ¢ = 1r + 0. 
As 3; < ¢ < 21r, ¢ is not the principal argument of z. 
arg z = q> - 21r = 0 - 1r. 
Hence Log z = log(- sec 0) + i(0 - 1r + 2n1r), where n is an integer 
and log z = log(- sec 0) + i(0 - 1r).

Let z1 = r1(cos 01 + i sin 01), z2 = r2(cos 02 + i sin 02). 
Then z1z2 = r1r2[cos(01 + 02) + i sin(01 + 02)].

Proof. Let z = r(cos 0 + i sin 0).

73 
Then zm = rm(cos m () + i sin m 0). 
Log z = log r + i(O + 2n1r), where n is an integer; 
Log zm = log rm + i( mO + 2p1r), where p is an integer. 
m Log z = m log r + i(mO + 2mn1r) 
= log rm+ i(mO + 2p11r), where P1 = mn. 
Since pis arbitrary and Pl is a multiple of m, each value of m Log z 
is a value of Log zm but not conversely. 
So the set of values of m Log z is a proper subset of the set of values 
of Log zm. Therefore Log zm =/=- mLog z. 
For example, let z = i, m = 2. 
2 Log z = 2 Log i = (4n + l)1ri, where n is an integer. 
Log z2 =Log(-1) = (2k + l)1ri, where k is an integer. 
Each value of 2 Log i is a value of Log i2 but not conversely. 
Hence Log i2 =/=- 2 Log i. 
4. If z =/=- 0 and m be a positive integer, Log z1/m = ! Log z. 
Proof. Let z = r(cos 0 + i sin 0). 
Then z1/m = y1r(cos 2k~+0 +i sin 2k~+0 ), where k = 0, l, ... , m-1. 
Log z = log r + i(0 + 2n1r), where pis an integer; 
Log z1/m = ! log r + i( 2k~+0 + 2p1r), where pis an integer 
= ! log r + i[!, + 2(k!imp) 1r]. 
Since O < k < m - 1 and p is an arbitrary integer, k + mp is also an 
arbitrary integer. Let k + mp = q. 
Then Log z1/m = ! log r + i(!, + 2;;), where q is an integer and

2.14. Complex exponents. 
If a be a non-zero complex number and z be any complex number, az 
is defined by 
az = exp(z Log a). 
Since Log a is many-valued, az is a many-valued function. The prin-
cipal value of az corresponds to the principal logarithm of a. 
Let a= r(cos 0 + i sin 0), -1r < 0 < 1r; and z = x + iy. 
Then z Log a= (x + iy)[log r + i(2n1r + 0)1, where n is an integer 
= [x logr - y(2n1r + 0)] + i[x(2n1r + 0) + y logr]. 
Therefore az = 
ex log r-y(2n1r+9) [cos{ x(2n1r + 0) + y log r} + 
i sin{x(2n1r + 0) + y logr}], where n is an integer. 
The principal value of az corresponds to n = 0. 
The p.v. of az = ex logr-y9[cos(x0 + y logr) + i sin(x0 + y logr)]

Then cos(2n7rx) + i sin(2n1rx) = 1 and ax is the unique real number 
ex log a. 
Subcase (ii). Let x be a rational number !, where p and q are integers 
prime to each other ( q > I). 
Then cos( 2n;p) + i sin( 2nq1rp) has only q distinct values and they 
correspond to n = 0, 1, ... , q - 1. 
Therefore a~ has only a finite number of values. 
The principal value of a~ is e~ log a (corresponding ton= 0). 
Subcase (iii). Let x be an irrational real number. 
Then sin(2n1rx) #- 0 for all integers n f:. O. Therefore ax has infinite

4. Let a be a negative real number and z = x, a real number. • 
Let a= -b, where b > 0. 
Then r = b,0 = 1r,y = O. 
77 
ax = ex log b[cos(2n + l)1rx + i sin(2n + l)1rx], where n is an integer. 
The p.v. of ax is ex log b[cos1rx + i sin 1rx]. 
Now the p.v. of (-l)x = exp[x(1ri)] 
= (cos 1rx + i sin 1rx). 
Hence the p.v. of ax =(the p.v. of bx).[the p.v. of (-l)x]. 
5. Let a= cos 0 + i sin 0, where 0 is real and z = x + iy. 
Then az 
( cos 0 + i sin 0)x+iy

e-y(2mr+O)[cos x(2n1r + 0) + i sin x(2n1r + 0)] 
e-Y Arg a[cos(x Arg a)+ i sin(x Arg a)]. 
Hence the p.v. of ( cos 0 + sin 0)x+iy 
= e-Y arga[cos(x arg a)+ i sin(x arga)]. 
5a. Let a= cos 0 + i sin 0, where 0 is real and z = x, a real number. 
Then ax= (cos 0 + i sin 0)x = [cos x(2n1r + 0) + i sin x(2n1r + 0)], 
where n is an integer 
and the p.v. of (cos 0+i sin 0)x = cos(x arg a)+i sin(x arg a), where 
a = cos 0 + i sin 0. 
Subcase (i). Let x be an integer. 
Then ( cos 0 + i sin 0)x = cos x0 + i sin x0. In this case ( cos 0 + 
i sin B)x has only one value. 
Subcase (ii). Let x be a rational number ~' where p and q are integers 
prime to each other ( q > l). 
Then cos(2n1r + 0) ~ + i sin(2n1r + 0) ! has only q distinct values. 
So in this case ( cos 0 + i sin 0)x has only a finite number of distinct 
values and cos x0 + i sin x0 ( corresponding to n = 0) is one of these. 
Theprincipalvalueof(cos B+i sin 0)~ iscos(!arga)+i sin(!arga), 
where a = cos 0 + i sin 0. 
Subcase (iii). Let x be an irrational real number, then ( cos B+i sin 0)x = 
cos x(2n1r + 0) + i sin x(2n1r + 0), where n is an integer and cos x0 + 
i sin x0 ( corresponding to n = 0) is one of these values. 
The principal value of ( cos 0 + i sin 0)x is cos x arg a+ i sin x arg a, 
where a = cos O + i sin 0.

Examples. 
1. if x, y be real, 
1x+iy = exp[(x+iy)Log l]=exp[(x+iy)(2n1ri)], where n is an integer 
= e-2mry[cos 2n1rx + isin 2n1rx]. 
In particular, if y = 0, then 
1 x = [cos 2n1rx + i sin 2n1rx], where n is an integer. 
(i) li x be an integer, [cos 2n1rx + i sin 2n1rx] = 1 for all n. Therefore 
1x = 1. 
(ii) If x be a rational number ~' where p, q are integers prime to each 
other ( q > 1), [ cos 2n 1r. ! + i sin 2n1r. ~] has q distinct values. Therefore 
there are q distinct values of 1 x in this case. 
(iii) If x be an irrational number, 1 x = [cos 2n1rx + i sin 2n1rx], where n 
is an integer. 
Since x is irrational, sin 2n1rx =I- 0 for all integers n =I- 0. For n = O, 
sin 2n1rx = 0 and cos 2n1rx = 1. Therefore there are infinite number of 
values of 1 x of which one is real and all others are non-real. 
2. If x, y be real, 
(-l)x+iy = exp[(x + iy)Log (-1)) 
= exp[(x + iy)(2n + l)1ri)], where n is an integer 
= e-<2n+I)1ry[cos (2n + l)1rx + isin (2n + l)1rx]. 
In particular, if y = 0, then 
(-1ri: = [cos (2n + l)1rx + i sin (2n + l)1rx), where n is an integer. 
(i) If x be an integer, [cos (2n + l)1rx + i sin (2n + l)1rx] = ±1 according 
as xis even or odd. Therefore (-l)x = ±1 according as xis even or odd. 
(ii) If x be a rational number ! , where p, q are integers prime to each 
other (q > 1), [cos (2n + l)1r.! + isin (2n + l)1r,!] has q distinct values, 
Therefore there are q distinct values of (-l)x in this case. 
(iii) If x be an irrational number, (-l)x = [cos (2n + I)1rx + isin (2n+ 
l)1rx], where n is an integer. 
· 
Since x is irrational, sin(2n + 1 )1rx =J. 0 for all integers n. Therefore 
there are infinite number of values of ( -1 )x all of which are non-real,

Properties. 
1. If z1, z2 and a are complex numbers where a -:/= O, 
az1 .az2 i= az1 +z2' 
but (the p.v. of az1 ).(the p.v. of az2 ) = the p.v. of az1+z2. 
Proof. az1 = exp(z1 Log a) 
= exp[z1(log a+ 2ntri)], where n is an integer; 
az2 = exp[z2(log a+ 2mtri)], where mis an integer; 
az1+z2 = exp[(z1 + z2)(log a+ 2ptri)] 
= exp[(z1 + z2) log a+ 2p(z1 + z2)tri], where pis an integer. 
az1 .az2 
exp[z1 (log a+ 2ntri)]. exp[z2(log a+ 2mtri)] 
= exp[z1(log a+ 2ntri) + z2(log a+ 2mtri)] 
= exp[(z1 + z2) log a+ 2(nz1 + mz2)tri]. 
79 
When m, n, p are arbitrary integers, the set of complex numbers 
p(z1 + z2) is a subset of the set of complex numbers nz1 + mz2, but 
not conversely. 
Therefore az1 .az2 -=I= az1 +z2 • 
But the p.v. of az1 = exp(z1 log a), the p.v. of az2 = exp(z2 log a) 
and the p.v. of az1 +z2 = exp[(z1 + z2) log a]. 
Therefore (the p.v. of az1 ).(the p.v. of az2 ) = the p.v. of az1 +z2 • 
2. ff z, a and bare complex numbers and ab-:/= 0, (ab)z = az .bz, but the 
p.v. of (abY =/- (the p.v. of az).(the p.v. of bz). 
Proof. 
az = exp(z Log a), 
bz = exp(z Log b), 
(abl = exp[z Log(ab)]. 
exp[z Log (ab)] 
exp(z Log a+ z Log b) 
= exp(z Log a). exp(z Log b). 
Therefore ( ab )z = az .bz. 
The p.v. of az = exp(z log a), the p.v. of bz = exp(z log b) and the 
p.v. of (abY = exp(z log ab). 
But log ab -:/= log a + log a, in general. 
Therefore the p.v. of (ab)z i= (the p.v. of az).(the p.v. of bz). 
3. If a and z are complex numbers and a i= 0, 
Log az = z Log a+ 2ntri, where n is an integer. 
Proof. 
Let z = x + iy, a= r(cos 0 + i sin 0), where -tr< 0 < tr. 
Then z Log a= (x + iy)[log r + i(0 + 2mtr)], where mis an integer 
= x log r - y(2mtr + 0) + i[x(2mtr + 0) + y log r]; 
and az = ex log r-y(2m1r+O) [cos{x(2mtr + 0) + y log r} + i sin{ x(2mtr +

Hence Log az = [x log r-y(2m1r+0)] +i[x(2m1r+0) +y log

1. Find the general values of ii. 
ii 
exp( i Log i) 
= 
exp[i(2n1r + ~ )i), where n is an integer 
= 
exp(-(4n + 1)~] = e-C4n+l)½. 
Note. The values of ii are all real. 
2. Find the principal value of (1 + i)i 
1 + i = v'2 ( cos ~ + i sin i). 
Log (l+i) =½log 2+i(2n1r+i), where n is an integer and log(l+i) == 
½ log 2 + li. 
Hence the p.v. of (1 + i)i 
exp[i log(l + i)] 
= exp[-~ + ½ (log 2)i] 
= 
e-¾ [cos(½ log 2) + i sin(½ log 2)). 
3. Show that the ratio of the principal values of (x + iy)a+ib and (x _ 
iy )a-ib, where x, y, a, b are real, is 
(i) cos2(blog r + a0) + isin2(blog r + a0), where r = Ix+ iyl, 0 = 
arg(x + iy) f:. 1r; 
(ii) e-2b71"[cos(2blog r) + isin(2blog r)], where r = lxl, arg(x + iy) = 1r. 
Let x+iy = r(cos 0+isin 0),-1r < 0 < 1r. Then r = lx+ iyl, 
0 = arg(x + iy). x - iy = r(cos 0 - i sin 0) = r[cos(-0) + isin(-0)). 
arg(x - iy) = -0 provided 0 f:. 1r. If 0 = 1r, then arg(x - iy) = 1r. 
Case 1. 0 = arg(x + iy) f:. 1r. 
The p.v. of (x + iy)a+ib = exp[(a + ib) log(x + iy)] 
= exp[(a + ib)(log r + i0)] 
= exp[(alog r - b0) + i(blog r + a0)]. 
The p.v. of (x - iy)a-ib = exp[(a - ib) log(x - iy)] 
= exp[(a - ib)(log r - i0)] 
= exp[(alog r - b0) - i(blog r + a0)]. 
The ratio = exp[2i(b log r + a0)] 
= cos2(blog r + a0) + isin2(blog r + a0). 

COMPLEX NUMBERS 
Case 2. 0 = arg(x + iy) = 1r. 
The p.v.of (x + iy)a+ib = exp[(alog r - b1r) + i(blog r + a1r)]. 
The p.v. of (x - iy)a-ib = exp[(a - ib)(log r + i1r)] 
= exp[(alog r + b1r) - i(blog r - a1r)]. 
The ratio = exp [-2b7r + 2ib log r] 
= e-2b1r[cos(2blog r) + isin(2blog r)]. 
4. Discuss the reality of xY, where x, y are both irrational. 
Case 1. x > 0. 
xY = exp[y Log x] = exp[y(log x + 2n1ri)], where n is an integer 
= eY log x [ cos 2ny1r + sin 2ny1r]. 
81 
For n = 0, sin 2ny1r = 0 and cos 2ny1r = l. sin 2ny1r f= 0 for all n f= 0. 
Therefore xY has infinite number of values of which only one is real 
and all others are non-real. 
Case 2. x < 0. Let x = -t, where t > 0. 
xY = (-t)Y = exp[y Log (-t)] = exp[y{logt+ (2n+ l)1ri}] 
= eylogt[cos(2n + I)y1r + isin(2n + l)y1r]. 
Since y is irrational, sin(2n + l)y1r is non-zero for all integers n. 
Therefore xY has infinite number of values all of which are non-real.

Definition of Logaz, where a and z are non-zero complex 
numbers. 
We define Logaz = w such that z is any value of aw. 
We have aw= exp (w Log a). Therefore z =exp (w Log a). 
This gives Log z = w Log a 
~ 
or, w = Log .. a. 
Thus w is a doubly infinitely many-valued function of z.

4. If x, y are real, 
sin(x + iy) = sin x cosh y + i cos x sinh y, 
cos(x + iy) = cos x cosh y - i sin x sinh y.

The right hand side expressions give the real and imaginary parts of 
sin z and cos z, when z is a complex number. 
It follows that 
I sin(x + iy) 12 
I cos(x + iy) 12 
sin2 x cosh2 y + cos2 x sinh2 y 
sin2 x cosh2 y + (1 - sin2 x) sinh2 y 
sin2 x + sinh2 y. 
cos2 x cosh2 y + sin2 x sinh2 y 
cos2 x cosh2 y + (1 - cos2 x) sinh2 y 
cos2 x + sinh2 y. 
Since sinh y increaes steadily with y, it follows that the functions 
sin z and cos z are not bounded in absolute value. But if x be real, the 
functions sin x and cos x are bounded in absolute value, as I sin x I and 
I cos x I are never greater than 1. 
5. When z is a complex number, 
sin z = sin z, cos z = cos z and tan z = tan z. 
Proof. Let z = x + iy, where x, y are real. 
sin z = sin(x + iy) 
sin x cash y + i cos x sinh y. 
sin z = sin(x - iy) -
sin x cosh(-y) + i cos x sinh(-y)

Therefore ex = t + Jt2 + 1, since ex> 0

= cosh z cos(2k1r) + i sinh z sin(2k1r) 
= cosh z, if k be an integer. 
sinh(z + 2k1ri) = sinh z cosh(2k1ri) + cosh z sinh(2k1ri) 
= sinh z cos(2k1r) + i cosh z sin(2k1r) 
= sinh z, if k be an integer.

Z IS a 
It follows that cosh z and sinh z are periodic functions of period 21ri. 
cosh(z + k1ri) 
cosh z cos(k1r) + i sinh z sin(k1r) 
(-I)k cosh z, if k be an integer. 
sinh(z + k1ri) 
sinh z cos( k1r) + i cosh z sin( k1r) 
(-l)k sinh z, if k be an integer. 
Therefore tanh(z + k1ri) = tanh z, for all integers k and so tanh z is 
a periodic function of period 1ri.

sin x sinh y = 0 
(ii) 
From (i) 
cos x = 0, since cosh y =I 0. 
Therefore x = ( 2n + 1) ~, where n is an integer. 
From (ii) 
sinh y = 0, since sin x = sin(2n + 1); =I 0. 
Therefore y = 0. 
Hence z = (2n + 1);, where n is an integer. 
2. Find all values of z such that sin z = 0.

cos x sinh y = 0 
From (i) 
sin x-:- 0, since cosh y =I 0. 
Therefore x = n1r, where n is an integer. 
From (ii) sinh y = 0, since cos x = cos n1r =I 0. 
Therefore y = O. Hence z = n1r, where n is an integer.

cos z=2

Therefore t = 2 ± y'3. 
When

When 
t = 2 - v'3, 
iz = 
Log (2 - v'3)

Therefore z =

Combining, z = 2n1r ± i log(2 + v'3), n being an integer.

When

When 
t = (2 - v'3)i, 
iz = 
Log (2 - v'3)i

Therefore z = 2n1r + ! - i log(2 - v'3)

Combining, z = n1r + (-l)n{ ! - i log(2 + v'3) }, n being an integer.

sin w = z => cos w = ±✓1 - z2 • 
Then exp(iw) = iz ± ✓1 - z2

Since Log z is a multiple-valued function of z, w is a multiple-valued

The principal value of w is obtained by choosing cos w = ✓1 - z2

and sin-1(2) = i - i log(2 + \!'3). 
3. Find Cos-1(-1), cos-1(-1). 
Let Cos-1(-1) = z. 
Then cos z = -I. 
t+! 
or, ~=-1, where t = exp iz 
or, t2 + 2t + 1 = 0 
or, t = -1, -1 
or, expiz = -1. 
Therefore iz = Log( -1) 
= log 1 + (1r + 2n1r)i, where n is an integer. 
or, z = 1r + 2n1r, where n is an integer. 
Therefore Cos-1(-1) = 1r + 2n1r, where n is an integer 
and cos-1(-1) = 1r. 
4. Find Cos-1(i), cos-1(i). 
Let Cos-1(i) = z. 
Then cos z = i. 
sin2 z + cos2 z = l gives sin z = ±y'2. 
We have exp(iz) = cos z + i sin z = (1 ± v'2)i. 

COMPLEX NUMBERS 
When exp(iz) = (1 + v'2)i, z 
When exp(iz) = (1 - v'2)i, z 
-i Log ( v'2 + l)i 
-i[log( v'2 + 1) + (2n1r + ~ )i] 
2n1r + ~ - i log( v'2 + I). 
-i Log (I - v'2)i 
-i[log( v'2 - 1) + (2n1r -
; )i] 
(2n1r - ~) - i log(v'2- 1) 
2n 1r - { ~ - i log ( v'2 + 1)}. 
Therefore Cos-1(i) = 2n1r ± {~ - i log(v'2 + 1)}, 
and cos-1(i) = 
~ - i log(-/2 + 1). 
5. Find Sin-1(i), sin-1(i). 
Let Sin-1(i) = z. 
Then sin z = i. 
sin2 z + cos2 z = 1 gives cos z = ±-/2. 
We have exp(iz) = cos z + i sin z = -1 ± -/2. 
When exp(iz) = v'2 - 1, z 
-i Log ( v'2 - 1) 
-i[log( v'2 - 1) + 2n1ri] 
2n1r - i log( v'2 - 1) 
2n1r + i log( v'2 + 1). 
When exp(iz) = --/2 - 1, z 
-i Log (--/2 - 1) 
-i[log( v'2 +I)+ (2n1r + 1r)i] 
(2n + I)1r - i log( v'2 + 1). 
Therefore Sin -l ( i) = 
n1r + ( -1 )n log( v'2 + 1 )i 
and sin-1(i) = i log( v'2 + 1). 
6. Find Tan-1(-1) and tan-1(-1). 
t-l 
tan z = -I=> t+l = -i, where t = exp(iz). 
t 
Therefore t2 = ~ +~ = -i or, exp ( 2iz) = -i. 
This gives 2iz = Log(-i) = (2n1r - ½1r)i 
or, z = n; - ~. 
Therefore Tan - 1 ( -1) = n; - ~ and tan - 1 ( -1) = - ~. 
7. Find z such that tan z = cos 0 + i sin 0, 0 < 0 < ~. 
tan z = cos 0 + i sin 0

8. If cosh-1 (x + iy) + cosh-1(x - iy) = cosh-1 a, where x, y, a are real 
and a> 1, prove that the point (x, y) lies on an ellipse. 
Let cosh-1(x + iy) = u + iv. Then cosh(u +iv)= x + iy. 
Therefore cosh u cos v = x, sinh u sin v = y. 
Then cosh(u - iv)= x - iy 
or, cosh- 1(x - iy) = u - iv+ 2k1ri, where k is some integer. 
Therefore (u +iv)+ (u - iv+ 2k1ri) = cosh-1 a 
or, cosh(2u + 2k1ri) = a 
or, cosh 2u = a.

(ii) 
x2 + y2 + 1 - 2y coth 2/3 = 0. 
If (x, y) = (0, ±1), tan-1(x + iy) is not defined. 
tan-1 (x + iy) =a+ i/3 implies tan(a + ?/3) = x + iy. 
Therefore tan(a - i/3) = x - iy, since tan z = tan z.

3. INTEGERS 
3.1. Natural numbers. 
The set N consiting of numbers 1, 2, 3, ... is called the set of all 
natural numbers. The well ordering property of the set N states that 
every non-empty subset of N contains a least element. 
This means that if S be a non-empty subset of N, there is some natural 
number a in S such that a < x for all x in S. 
3.1.1. Principle of induction. 
Let S be a subset of N with the properties -
(i) 1 belongs to S, and 
(ii) whenever a natural number k belongs to S, then k + I belongs 
to S. 
Then S = N. 
Proof. Let T be the set of all those natural numbers which are not in S. 
The theorem will be proved if we can prove that Tis an empty set. 
Let us assume that Tis a non-empty set. Then by the well ordering 
property T possesses a least element, say m. Since 1 E S, m > 1 and so 
m - 1 is a natural number. Again since m is the least element in T, m - 1 
is not in T and so m - 1 is in S. 
Since m - 1 is in S, 
by (ii) (m - 1) + 1 is in S, i.e., mis in S which 
is a contradiction. 
Therefore our assumption is wrong and T is empty and the theorem 
is proved.

Then by the principle of induction S = N. 
Thus En is true for all n E N. 
Note. To establish a theorem (or a proposition) involving natural num.

Therefore 1 + 2 + • · · + k + (k + 1) = k(kil) + (k + 1) = (k+l)Jk+2). 
This shows that the statement is true for the natural number k + 1 if 
it is true for k. 
By the principle of induction, the statement is true for all natural

2. Prove that 32n - 8n - 1 is divisible by 64 for all n EN. 
We use the principle of induction to prove the statement. Let J(n):::: 
32n - 8n -1. 
Step 1. /(1) = 9 - 8 - 1 = 0. /(1) is divisible by 64. Therefore the 
statement is true for n = 1. 
Step 2. f(k + 1) - /(k) = [32k+2 - 8(k + 1) - 1] - [32k - 8k - 1] 
= 8(32k - 1) = 8(9k - 1) 
= 8.8(9k- l + gk-2 + ... + 1) 
= 64p, where pis an integer. 
Therefore f ( k + 1) is divisible by 64 if f ( k) is so. 
This proves that the statement is true for k + 1 if it is true for k.

Then S = N. 
Proof. Let T = N - S. We prove that T = </>. If not, T being a non-
empty subset of N must have a least element, say m, by the well ordering 
property of N. 
Since 1 E S, m =I- 1. 
Therefore m > 1. 
By the choice of m, all natural numbers less than m belongs to s. 
Hence 1, 2, ... , m - 1 E S.

3.2. Integers. 
The set of all integers, denoted by Z, consists of whole nuµibers 
0, ±1, ±2, ±3,... 
. .. The set of all positive integers (a proper subset 
of Z) is identified with the set N. We shall use the properties and prin-
ciples of N in connection with the proof of any theorem about positive 
integers. 
Theorem 3.2.1. Division algorithm. 
Given integers a and b with b > 0, there exist unique integers q and 
r such that 
a = bq + r, where O < r < b. 
Proof. Let us consider the subset of integers 
S = { a - bx : x E Z, a - bx > 0}. 
First we show that S is non-empty. 
Since b > l, I a I b > I a I- Therefore a+ I a I b > a+ I a I> 0. 
This shows that a - b(-lal) ES and therefore Sis non-empty. 
Since Sis a non-empty set of non-negative integers, either 
(i) S contains O as its least element, or 
(ii) S contains a smallest positive inetger as its least element by the 
well ordering property of the set N. 
In either case, we call it r. Therefore there exists an integer q such 
that a - bq = r, r > 0. 
We assert that r < b. Because if r > b, then 
a - (q + l)b = (a - qb) - b = r - b > 0. 
This shows that a - ( q + 1 )b belongs to S and also a - ( q + l )b = 
r - b < r. This leads to a contradiction to the fact that r is the least 
element in S. 
Hence r < b and consequently, a = bq + r where O < r < b. 
In order to establish uniqueness of q and r, let us suppose that a 
has two representations: 
a = bq + r, a = bq1 + r1 where O < r < b, 
0 < T1 < b. 
Then b( q - q1) = r 1 - r 
or, b I q - q1 I= I r1 - r I-
But O < r1 < b and -b < -r < 0 yield -b < r1 -
r < b, i.e., 
I r1 - r I< b. Consequently, I q - q1 I< 1. 
Since q and q1 are integers, the only possibility is q = q1 and therefore 
r == r1. 
This completes the proof.

Definition. An integer a is said to be divisible by an integer b -/- 0 if 
there exists some integer c such that 
a = be. 
We express this in symbol bla and read "b divides a". We also expr~ 
this by the statements- "b is a divisor of a", "a is a multiple of b" • 
If bis a divisor of a, then -bis also a divisor of a, because a=== be~ 
a= (-b)(-c). Thus divisors of an integer occur in pairs. 
Note. In the symbol bla, bis not 0 but a may be 0. Thus 0 is a multiple 
of every non-zero integer. 
The following properties are immediate ( assuming that a divisor is 
always a non-zero integer).

a I b and b I c => a I c, 
(ii) 
a I b and b I a if and only if a = ±b.

Theorem 3.2.3. If a I band a I c then a I (bx+cy) for arbitrary integers 
x and y. 
Proof. Since a I b, 
b = ad for some integer d. 
Since a I c, 
c = ae for some integer e. 
Therefore bx+ cy = adx + aey = a(dx + ey). 
This shows that a I (bx+ cy) whatever integers x, y may be. 
Worked Examples. 
1. Prove that the product of any m consecutive integers is divisible by 
m. 
Let the consecutive integers be c, c + I, c + 2, ... , c + (m - 1). 
By division algorithm, there exist integers q and r such that c = 
mq + r, 
0 < r < m. 
When r = 0, c = mq and therefore 
m I c; 
when r = 1, c + (m - I) = m(q + 1) and therefore 
m I c + (m - 1); 
when r = 2, c + m - 2 = m(q + 1) and therefore 
m I c + (m - 2); 
when r = m-1, c+ 1 = m(q+ 1) and therefore 
m I c+ I. 
Therefore whatever integer r may be, m divides one of the integers 
c, c+l, . .. , c+(m-1) and it follows that the product c(c+I)(c+2) ... (c+ 
m - 1) is always divisible by m. 
2. Use division algorithm to prove that the square of an odd integer is 
of the form Bk+ 1, where k is an integer. 
By division algorithm every integer, upon division by 4, leaves one 
of the remainders 0, 1, 2, 3. Therefore any integer is one of the forms 
4q, 4q + 1, 4q + 2, 4q + 3, where q is an integer. 
Odd integers are of the forms 4q + 1, 4q + 3. 
Now (4q + 1)2 = B(2q2 + q) + l is of the form Bk+ 1, 
( 4q + 3) 2 = 8(2q2 + 3q + l) + 1 is of the form Bk + I. 
Hence the square of an odd integer is of the form Bk + I. 
Definition. If a and b are integers then an integer d is said to be a 
common divisor of a and b if d I a as well as d I b. 
Since 1 is a divisor of every integer, 1 is a common divisor of a and 
b. Therefore, for an arbitrary pair of integers a, b there exists always a 
common divisor. 
If both of a and b be O then each integer is a common divisor of a and 
b. But if at least one of a and b is non-zero there is only a finite number 
of positive common divisors. Of these positive common divisors, there 

112 
HIGHER ALGEBRA 
is a greatest one, called the greatest common divisor and is denoted by 
gcd(a, b). 
Definition. Greatest common divisor. 
If a and b are integers, not both zer~, .the. greatest co"':m~n divisor of 
a and b, denoted by gcd( a, b) is the positive integer d satisfying 
. 
(i) 
d I a and d I b; and 
(ii) 
if c I a and c I b then c I d. 
For example, let a = 12, b = -18. Then the positive divisors of 12 are 
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and those of -18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. Therefore the positive 
common divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6 and gcd(12, -18) = 6. 
Note. It follows from the definition that gcd( a, -b) = gcd(-a, b) ::: 
gcd( -a, -b) = gcd( a, b), where a and b are integers, not both zero. 
Theorem 3.2.4. If a and bare integers, not both zero, then there exist 
integers u and v such that gcd( a, b) = au + bv. 
Proof. Let S ={ax+ by: x, y E Zand ax+ by> 0}. First we show that 
Sis a non-empty set. 
Since at least one of ~' b is non-zero, let a =I= 0. Then I a I> 0. 
Therefore I a I= a.x + b.0 is an element of S, where we choose x = l 
if a > 0 and x = -1 if a < 0. 
Since S is a non-empty set of positive integers, by the well ordering 
property of the set N, S contains a least element, say d. 
Then d = au + bv for some integers u, v. 
By division algorithm, a = dq + r where q and r are integers with 
0 < r < d. 
Therefore r 
a-dq 
a-(au+bv)q 
a(l - uq) + b(-vq). 
This representation shows that if r > 0 then r E S. 
But d is the least element in S and since r < d, r ~ S. 
Consequently, r = 0. This proves that a = dq, i.e., d is a divisor of 0• 
By similar arguments we can prove that dis a divisor of b. Therefore• 
d becomes a common divisor of a and b. 
Let us assume that c is a common divisor of a and b. 
Then c I a and c I b and therefore c I ( au + bv), by Theorem 3.2.3, 
i.e., c I d and consequently, d is the greatest common divisor. 
This completes the proof. 

For example, 
gcd(-4, 20) = 4 
and 
gcd(55, 35) = 5 
and 
gcd(0, 9) = 9 
and 
gcd(-9, 13) = 1 
and

4 = -4.(-1) + 20.0; 
5 = 55.2 + 35.(-3); 
9 = 0.0 + 9.1; 
1 = -9.(-3) + 13. -2. 
113 
Note 1. The gcd(a, b) is the least positive value of ax+ by where x, y 
~~~~-
. 
But x and Y are not uniquely determined integers for which the integer 
ax+by is least positive. Because if d = au+bv, where u and v are integers 
then d can also be expressed as d = a( u + kb) + b( v - ka) where k is an 
integer. 
For example, let a = 15, b = 24. Then d = 3 and d = 15(-3) + 24.2 
which can also be expressed as d = 15.(-3 + 24k) + 24(2 - 15k) for any 
integer k. 
Note 2. Guaranteed by the theorem it is always possible to express 
gcd( a, b) as a linear combination of a and b. But the theorem gives no 
clue how to express gcd(a, b) in the desired form au+ bv, i.e., how to 
determine u and v. This will be discussed in a subsequent article. 
Worked Example (continued). 
3. Show that gcd(a, a+ 2) = 1 or 2 for every integer a. 
Let d = gcd(a, a+ 2). Then d I a and d I a+ 2. 
Therefore d I ax+ (a+ 2)y for all integers x, y. 
Taking x = -1, y = l, it follows that d j 2. i.e., dis either 1 or 2. 
Theorem 3.2.5. If k be a positive integer, gcd(ka, kb) = k.gcd(a, b). 
Proof Let d = gcd(a, b). Then there exist integers u and v such that 
d =au+ bv. Since d = gcd(a, b), 
d I a and d I b. 
d I a ⇒ kd I ka, d I b ⇒ kd I kb. 
Therefore kd is a common divisor of ka and kb. 
Let c be a common divisor of ka and kb. 
c I ka ⇒ ka = pc for some integer p; and c I kb ⇒ kb = qc for some 
integer q. 
Now kd = k(au + bv) = pcu + qcv = (pu + qv)c. 
As pu + qv is an integer, it follows that c I kd. 
Consequently, kd = gcd(ka, kb), i.e., gcd(ka, kb) = k.gcd(a, b). 
This completes the proof.

and this shows that d is prime to ab. 
d I 3ab and dis prime to ab implies d I 3, Therefore d = l or d = 3. 
8. Prove that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible 
by 6. 
By division algorithm, any integer, upon division by 3, leaves one 
of the remainders 0, 1, 2. Therefore any integer n is one of the forms 
3k,3k + 1,3k + 2. 
When n = 3k, n is divisible by 3. 
When n = 3k + 1, n + 2 is divisible by 3. 
When n = 3k + 2, n + 1 is divisible by 3. 
It follows that for any integer n, n(n + l)(n + 2) is divisible by 3. 
Again, the product of two consecutive integers is divisible by 2. 
Therefore 2 I n(n + l)(n + 2) and 3 I n(n + l)(n + 2). 
Since gcd(2, 3) = 1, it follows that 2.3 I n(n + l)(n + 2), i.e., 6 I 
n(n + l)(n + 2).

Since r is an odd positive integer, n + 1 is a divisor of each term in 
the right hand side of (i). Therefore (n + l)l2Sn•·· ... (ii) 
Again 2Sn = [lr + (n - lf] + [2r + (n - 2f] + • • • + [(n - lf + 1r] + 2nr 
. . . . . . (iii) 
Clearly, n is a divisor of each term in the right hand side of (iii). 
Therefore nl2Sn••· ... (iv) 
Because n and n + 1 are prime to each other, it follows from (ii) and 
(iv) that n(n + 1) is a divisor of 2Sn. 
As n(n+ 1) is divisible by 2, n(~+I) is an integer and therefore n(n2+I) 
is a divisor of Sn. 
That is, 1 + 2 + · · · + n is a divisor of 1 r + 2r + • .. + n r if r is an odd 
positive integer. 
3.2.11. Euclidean algorithm. 
Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method of finding the greatest 
common divisor of two given integers. The method involves repeated 
application of the division algorithm. 
Let a and b be two integers whose g .c.d. is required. 
Since gcd( a, b) = gcd( I a I, I b I), it is enough to assume that a and b 
are positive integers. Without loss of generality, we assume a> b > 0. 
By division algorithm, a = bq1 + r1 where 0 < r1 < b. 
ff it happens that r 1 = 0, then b I a and gcd( a, b) = b. 
If r1 f:. 0, then by division algorithm, b = r1 q2 + r2 where 0 < r2 < r 1. 
If r2 = 0, the process stops. If r2 f:. 0, then by division algorithm, 
r = r2q3 + r3 where 0 < r3 < r2. 
The process continues until some zero remainder appears. This must 
happen because the remainders r1, r2, r3, ... form a decreasing sequence 
of integers and since r 1 < b, the sequence contains at most b non-negative 
integers. 
Let us assume that r n+ 1 = 0 and r n is the last non-zero remainder. 
We have the following relations 
a 
bq1 + r1 
0 < r1 < b;

We assert that r n is the gcd( a, b). First of all we prove the 
lemma - If a= bq + r, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). 
Proof. Let d = gcd(a, b). Then d I a and d I b.

This implies dl(a-bq) , i.e., djr. This shows that d 18 a common divisor 
of b &.nd r . 
Let c be a common divisor of band r. Then c I bq + r, i.e., c I a. 
This shows that c is a common divisor of a and b. 
Since d = gcd( a, b), it follows from the property of the g.c.d. that 
c I d and this gives d = gcd(b, r). 
We utilise the lemma to show that r n = gcd( a, b). 
Tn = gcd(O, rn) = gcd(rn-1, rn) = gcd(rn-2 , Tn-1)

Tn is expressed as a linear combination of Tn-2 and Tn-3· Proceeding 
backwards we can express r n as a linear combination of a and b.

315 = l+ 315' 
252= l+ 252 ' 
63 = 4. 
Then 567 = 315.1 + 252, 
315 = 252.1 + 63, 
252 = 63.4 + 0. 
The last non-zero remainder is 63. Therefore gcd(567, 315) = 63. 
63 = 315 - 252.1 
315 - (567 - 315) 
= 567.(-1) + 315.2 
= 567u + 315v, where u = -1, v = 2. 
11. Find two integers u and v satisfying 
63u + 55v = 1. 
63 and 55 are integers prime to each other and therefore there eXist 
integers u, v such that 63u + 55v = 1. 
By division algorithm, 
63 = 55.1 + 8, 
55 = 8.6 + 7, 
8 = 7.1 + 1. 
We have 1 = 8 - 7 = 8 - (55 - 8.6) = 8.7 - 55 
= (63 - 55).7 - 55 = 63.7 + 55.(-8). 
Therefore u = 7, v = -8.

12. Find two integers u and v satisfying

Let us find the gcd(54, 24). 
By division algorithm, 
54 = 24.2 + 6, 
24 = 6.4 + 0. 
Therefore gcd(54, 24) = 6. 
6 = 54 - 24.2 = 54.1 + 24.(-2). 
Consequently, 30 = 54.5 + 24.(-10). Therefore u = 5, v = -10.

Definition. Let a1, a2, ... , an be integers different from zero. An integer 
b is said to be a common multiple of a 1, a2 , ..• , an if ai I b for i 
1,2, ... ,n. 
In fact, common multiples do exist. 
O is a common multiple of 
a1, a2, ... , an. The products a1a2 . .. an and --a1a2 ... an are both com-
mon multiples of a1, a2, ... , an and one of these is positive. By the well 
ordering property of the set N, the set of all positive common multiples 
contains a least element which is of special interest. 
Definition. Least common multiple. 
Let a1 , a2, ... , an be integers different from zero. The least positive 
common multiple is said to be the least common multiple (lcm) of the 
integers a1, a2, ... , an and it is denoted by [a1, a2, ... , an]-
For example, the lcm of 2, 3, 6 is 6; the lcm of -2, -3, -6 is 6; the 
lcm of -2, -6, 10 is 30. 
Theorem 3.2.12. 
If h be any common multiple of the integers 
a1, a2, ... , an, none of which is zero, then [a1, a2, ... , an] I h. 
Proof. Let m be the lcm of a1, a2, ... , an. By division algorithm, there 
exist integers q and r such that h = mq + r, where O < r < m. 
For each i = 1, 2, ... , n, 
ai I h and ai I m and therefore ai I r. 
This shows that r is a common multiple. If r > 0 then r becomes 
a positive common multiple less than the least common multiple m, a 
contradiction. 
Therefore r = 0 and consequently, m is a divisor of h. 
This completes the proof. 
Note. If m = [a1, a2 , •••,an] then the common multiples of the integers 
a1,a2, ... ,an is the set {O,±m,±2m,···}. 
Theorem 3.2.13. If a, b are integers different from zero and k is a 
positive integer, then [ka, kb] = k[a, b]. 
Proof. Let M = (ka, kb). Then M is a multiple of ka, kb. 
Let M = p(ka) = q(kb), where p, q are integers. Then 1: =pa= qb. 
This shows that 1: is a common multiple of a and b.

m 1s a multiple of a and b. Let m = ar = bs, where r, s are integ 
Then mk = (ak)r = (bk)s. This shows that mk is a common mult~~~-
of ak and bk. Since M = [ka, kb], M < mk. 
e 
Consequently, M = mk, i.e., [ka, kb] = k[a, b]. 
Theorem 3.2.14. If a and bare integers different from zero, then 
[a,b](a,b) =I ab I, 
where [a, b] = the lcm of a and b; (a, b) = the gcd of a and b. 
Proof. First we assume that a and b are positive integers. 
Case 1. Let (a, b) = 1. 
As [a, b] is a multiple of a and b, let [a, b] = pa for some integer p. 
Then b I pa. 
Since ( a, b) = 1, it follows that b I p. Therefore b < p, ba < pa. 
Again, ba being a common multiple of a and b cannot be less than 
[a, b], i.e., cannot be less than pa, so that ba = pa. 
Thus [a, b] = ab and this gives [a, b](a, b) = ab. 
Case 2. Let (a, b) = d > 1. Then ( i, ~)= 1, by theorem 3.2.7. 
Since (i, ~)= 1, we obtain, by case 1, [~, ~](~, ~) = ~~ 
or, d[~, ~]d( ~, ~)= ab. 
But d[~, ~]= [a, b], by theorem 3.2.13 and d(~, ~)= (a, b), by theo-
rem 3.2.5. Therefore [a, b]( a, b) = ab. 
In the general case, let a, b be non-zero integers, positive or negative. 
Since [a,-b] = [-a,b] = [-a,-b] = [a,b],(a,-b) = (-a,b) == 
(-a, -b) = (a, b), whatever non-zero integers a, b may be, it follows that 
[a, b] = [I a I, I b I], (a, b) =(Ia I, I b I). 
Hence [a, b](a, b) = [I a I, I b l](I a I, I b I) 
=I a II b I, by what we have proved 
=I ab I-
This completes the proof.

Theorem 3.3.3. If p be a prime number and a is an integer > p such 
that p is a divisor of a, then gcd( a, p) = p. 
Proof. Since pis a divisor of a, a= pk where k is an integer. 
Hence gcd(a,p) = gcd(pk,p) = p.gcd(k, 1) = p. 
Theorem 3.3.4. If p be a prime number and p I ab, then either p I a or 
p I b. 
Proof. If p I a then the theorem is done. 
If pis not a divisor of a then gcd(a,p) = 1, since 1 and pare the only 
divisors of p. 
Since gcd( a, p) = 1, there exist integers u and v such that au+ pv = l. 
Then abu + pbv = b. 
Now p I ab and p I pb => p I (ab)u + (pb)v, since u and v are integers. 
That is, p I b. 
This completes the proof. 
Corollary. If p be a prime and p I a1 a2 .•• an, then p I ak for some k

Proof. If p I a1 we need not go further. If p is not a divisor of a1 then by

If pis not a divisor of a2 then p I a3a4 ... an. Proceeding in a similar

Theorem 3.3.5. A composite number has at least one prime divisor. 
Proof. Let n be a composite number. Since n is not a prime, it has a 
positive divisor other than 1 and n. 
Let S be the set of those positive divisors of n which are different 
from 1 and n. Then S is non-empty. By the well ordering property of 
the set N, S contains a least element, say d. Then 1 < d < n. 
We prove that dis a prime. 
If d be not a prime then d has a divisor d' other than d and 1; and 
1 < d' < d < n. But d' I d and d In=> d' I n. Therefore d' E Sand this 
contradicts that d is the least element of S. 
Therefore d is a prime and the theorem is done.

If n = 3k then n is not a prime. 
If n = 3k + 1 then n + 2 = 3( k + l) and it is not a prime. 
If n = 3k + 2 then n + 4 = 3(k + 2) and it is not a prime.

If p = 3k + 2 then 4p+ 1 = 12k + 9 = 3(4k + 3) and it is not a prime. 
The only conclusion is, p = 3k. Since p is a prime, k = 1. So p == 3. 
3. If p > q > 5 and p, q are both primes, prove that 24 I (p2 - q2). 
Since p and q are primes > 3, p and q are of the form 3k + l or 3k + 2, 
where k is an integer. 
If both p and q are either of the forms 3k + 1 or 3k + 2, then 3 I (p- q). 
If one of p and q is of the form 3k + 1 and the other is of the form 
3k + 2, them 3 I (p + q). 
Thus in any case, 3 I (p2 - q2 ) . 
Since p and q are odd primes, p and q are of the form 4k+ 1 or 4k+3, 
where k is an integer. 
If both p and q are of the form 4k + 1, then 2 I (p + q) and 4 I (p-q). 
If both p and q are of the form 4k + 3, then 2 I (p + q) and 4 I (p-q). 
If one of p and q is of the form 4k + 1 and the other is of the form 
4k + 3, then 4 I (p + q) and 2 I (p - q). 
Thus in any case, 8 I (p2 -
q2). 
Since 3 and 8 are prime to each other, 24 I (p2 - q2). 
4. If p and p 2 + 8 are both prime numbers, prove that p = 3. 
Any integer p is one of the forms 3k, 3k + 1, 3k + 2, where k is an 
integer. 
If p = 3k + l, then p
2 + 8 = 3(3k2 + 2k + 3). Since p2 + 8 is a prillle~ 
3k2 + 2k + 3 must be 1 for some integer k and in that case p2 + 8 nius 
be 3. 
But for no integer k, 3k2 + 2k + 3 can be 1 and for no integer k, P2 +B 
can be 3. Therefore p = 3k + 1 is an impossibility. 

INTEGERS 
127 
If p = 3k + 2, then P
2 + 8 = 3(3k2 + 4k + 4). Since p2 + 8 is a prime, 
3k2 + 4k + 4 must be 1 for some integer k and in that case p2 + 8 must 
be 3. 
By similar arguments, p = 3k + 2 is an impossibility. 
Therefore P = 3k, where k is an integer. Since pis a prime, k must 
be 1 and therefore p = 3. 
5. If 2n - 1 be a prime, prove that n is a prime. 
Let n be composite. Then n = p.q where p and q are integers each 
greater than 1. 
2n - 1 = 2Pq - 1 = (2P - 1)(2P(q-l) + 2P(q-2) + · · · + 2P + 1). 
Each factor on the right is evidently greater than 1 and therefore 
2n - 1 is composite. 
Contrapositively, 2n - 1 is a prime implies n is a prime. 
6. Prove that n4 + 4n is a composite number for all n > l. 
Case 1. Let n be even. 
Then n 4 + 4n is divisible by 4 and so it is a composite number. 
Case 2. Let n be odd and n = 2k + 1, where k is a natural number. 
Then n4 + 4n = n4 + 4.42k = n4 + 4a4 , where a = 2k 
= (n2 +2a2)2-(2an)2 = (n2 +2an+2a2)(n2 -2an+2a2 ). 
(n2 +2an+2a2 ) = (n+a) 2 +a2 and (n2 -2an+2a2 ) = (n-a) 2 +a2• 
Since a is a positive integer> 1, (n+a)2+a2 > 1 and (n-a) 2+a2 > 1. 
Consequently, n4 + 4n is a composite number when n is odd. 
Hence n4 + 4n is a composite number for all n > l. 
7. Let p be a prime and a be a positive integer. Prove that an is divisible 
by p if and only if a is divisible by p. 
Let a be divisible by p. Then a = pk for some integer k. 
an= pnkn = p(pn-lkn) = pm, where mis an integer. 
This shows that an is divisible by p. . .

Let a be not divisible by p. Since p is a prime, gcd( a, p) = 1. Therefore 
there exist integers u and v such that au + pv = 1. 
Then anun = (1 - pv)n = 1 - ps wheres is an integer 
or, anr + ps = 1 where r, s are integers. 
This shows that gcd(an,p) = I and therefore an is not divisible by p. 
Hence a is not divisible by p => an is not divisible by p. 
Contrapositively, p I an => p I a. . .

Theorem 3.3.6. (Fundamental theorem of Arithmetic} 
Any positive integer is either 1, or a prime, or it can be expreesed as 
a product of primes, the representation being unique except for the order 
of the prime factors. 
Proof. Let n be a positive integer. Either n = l or n > l. Let P(n) be 
the statement that n( > 1) is either a prime, or it can be expressed as a 
product of primes. 
P(2) is true, since 2 is a prime. 
Let us assume that P( n) is true for all n, where n is a positive integer 
such that 2 < n < k. 
If k + l be itself a prime then P( k + l) is true and by the second 
principle of induction, P(n) is true for all positive integers n > I. 
If k + l be not a prime then it is a composite number. Let k + 1 = rs 
where r, s are integers with 2 < r < k + l, 2 < s < k + l. 
By induction hypothesis, P(r) and P(s) are both true. Then 
r = P1P2 .. ·Pi where P1,P2, ... ,Pi are primes, i > 1; 
s = q1q2 •.. Qj where q1 , q2, ... , qi are primes, j > 1. 
Thus k + l is expressed as the product of primes and P(k + 1) is 
proved to be true. By the second principle of induction p( n) is true for 
all positive integers n > l. 
Hence the first part of the theorem is established. 
In order to prove uniqueness of the representation, let us assume that 
n = P1P2 • • • Pk = Q1 Q2 . . • Qm, where Pi and qi are all primes. 
Since P1 I n, it follows that P1 I Q1 q2 ... qm. 
Since P1 is a prime, P1 I qr for some r where 1 < r < m. But since Pi 
and qr are both primes, P1 = Qr. 
We obtain 
P2P3 •••Pk= Q1Q2 • • • qr-lqr+l ... qm. 
We repeat the argument with P2 and obtain p2 = q8 for some s, where 
1 < s < m, s =/= r. Then 
p3p4 •··Pk= Q1q2 · · · qr-lqr+l · · · Qs-lQs+l ... Qm• 
If k < m, then after k steps the left hand side reduces to 1 and the 
right hand side becomes the product of m - k 
q's, each of which is a 
prime. This cannot happen. Therefore k > m. 
If k > m, then after m steps the right hand side reduces to 1 and 
the left hand side becomes the product of k - m p's, each of which is a 
prime. This cannot happen. Therefore k < m. 
Hence k = m and the products P1P2 ... Pm and q1 q2 .• • qk give the 
same representation except for the order of the factors. 

INTEGERS 
129 
Thus n(> 1) is expressed as the product of a number of primes, the 
representation being unique except for the order of the factors. 
Note. In the application of the fundamental theorem we write any inte-
ger n(> 1) in the form, called the canonical form, 
n = Pl 01 P2 a2 ••• Pr Or' 
where the primes Pi are distinct with p1 < p2 < • • • < Pr and the expo-
nents ai are positive. 
An integer is said to be square-free if no ai in the canonical form of 
n is greater than 1. 
To illustrate the representation, let us take n = 3150, 210. 
3150 = 2.3.3.5.5.7 = 2.32.52.7. 210 = 2.3.5.7. 210 is square free. 
Another representation. Every positive integer n (including 1) can 
also be expressed as n = ITpa(p), where pis a prime and a(p) is an integer 
p 
> 0 and a(p) = 0 for sufficiently large p. 
In particular, if n = 1, then each a (p) = 0 and in this case the product 
IIpa(p) becomes empty. 
p 
The symbol a(p) indicates that a depends on the prime p. 
If a= ITpa(p), b = npJ3(P) be two positive integers then 
p 
p 
the g.c.d. of a and bis Jip-Y(P), where ,'(P) = min {a(p), ,B(p)} and 
p 
the l.c.m. of a and bis ITp0(P) , where ~(p) = max { a(p), ,B(p)}. 
p 
Since max{a,,B}+min{a,,B} = a+,B for any two real numbers a and 
,8, it follows that for any two positive integers a, b, (a, b).[a, b] = a.b. 
For example, let a= 60, b = 63, c = 1. Then 
a= 22.3.5.7°, 
b = 2°.32.5°.7, 
c = 2°.3°.5°.7°. 
(a, b) = 2°.3.5°.1° = 3, 
(a, c) = 2°.3°.5°.7° = 1, 
[a, b] = 22 .32 .5. 7 = 1260, 
[a, c] = 22 .3.5. 7° = 60. 
(a, b).[a, b] = 3.1260 = 3780 = a.b; (a, c).[a, c] = 1.60 = a.c. 
Theorem 3.3. 7~ If a, b, c be positive integers then 
(i) 
(a, [b, c]) = [(a, b), (a, c)]; 
(ii) 
[a, (b, c)] = ([a, b], [a, c]).

min { o., max {,B,,}} = max { min { o., f3}, nun { o.,,}} 
(ii) 
max { o., min {,B,,}} = min { max { o:, [3}, max { o:,-y} }. 
Proof. (i) Let us consider the following cases. 
Case 1. o. < min {[3,, }. Then o. < max {[3,, }. 
L.H.S. = o., 
R.H.S.= max { o:, o:} = o:. 
Case 2. o. > max {,B,, }. Then o: > {3, o: > ,. 
L.H.S. = max {,B,, },

L.H.S. = min { o,,} = o.,

Case 4. , < o < {3. 
L.H.S. = min { o, ,B} = o, 
R.H.S. = max { o:,,} = o.. 
This completes the proof.

Similar proof. 
Proof of the theorem. 
In consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, there exist 
prime numbers P1, P2, ... , Pn such that 
a = P1 °1 P2 °2 ••• Pn an, where O.i are integers > 0, 
b = p/31p/32 .. • Pnf3n, where f3i are integers > 0, 
C = Pl 'Ylp2 72 .. · Pn 'Yn, where ri are integers > 0. 
[b, c] = Pl x1P2x2 ... Pn Xn' where Xi = max {f3i, ri}, i = 1, 2, ... , n. 
(a, [b, c]) = Pl Y1p2Y2 •• • PnYn, where Yi = min { Oi, Xi}, i = 1, 2, ... 'n. 
(a,b) =P1w1P2w2 ···Pnwn, where Wi = min {oi,f3i}, i = 1,2, ... ,n. 
(a, c) = Pl z1P2z2 •• • PnZn' where Zi = min { O.i, ri}, i = 1, 2, ... ' n. 
[ ( a, b), ( a, c)] = Pl ti P2 t 2 • • • Pn tn, where ti = max { Wi, Zi}, i == 
1, 2, . .. , n. 
By the lemma, we have Yi = min { o.i, Xi} 
= min { oi, max {f3i, ri}} 
= max { min { oi, .Bi}, min { o.i, ,i}} 
= max { wi, zi} = ti, i = 1, 2, ... n. 
Therefore (a, [b, c]) = [(a, b), (a, c)]. 
(ii) 
Similar proof by using lemma (ii).

Note. If we define binary operations o and * on the set N by 
a o b = the g.c.d. of a and b, 
a* b = the l.c.m. of a and b for a, b E N 
131 
then the part (i) of the theorem states that a o (b*c) = (a ob)* (a o c) for 
a, b EN and the part (ii) of the theorem states that a*(boc) = (a*b)o(a*c) 
for a, b EN. 
These establish that the operation o is distributive over the operation 
* and the operation* is distributive over the operation o. 
Worked Examples. 
1. If 2n + 1 is an odd prime for some integer n, prove that n is a power 
of 2. 
If n is odd, 2n + 1 is divisible by 2 + 1 and therefore 2n + 1 is not a 
prime. Son is even.

If p > 1, 2n + 1 = 22k ·P + 1 = (22k )P + 1 and it is divisible by 22k + 1, 
since p is odd. This contradicts that 2n + 1 is a prime. 
Consequently, p = 1 and n = 2k. 
2. If p be a prime, show that ..,/P is not a rational number. 
Since p is a prime, p is an integer > 2 and therefore ../P > I. 
Let ..,/P be a rational number. Then ..,/P = 1;: for some natural num-
bers m, n. We assert that m > 1 and n > I, because 
m = I and n = l => p = 12 = 1, a contradiction 
m > 1 and n = 1 => p = m. m and therefore p is not a prime, a 
contradiction 
m = 1 and n > l => ..,/P < 1, a contradiction. 
Therefore m > 1 and n > I. We also have pn2 = m 2 • The number 
of primes in the factorisation of m being unique by the fundamental 
theorem of arithmetic, it follows that the number of primes ( counting 
multiplicity) in the factorisation of m 2 is always even. 
Similarly, the number of primes in the factorisation of n 2 is also even. 
Therefore the number of primes in the factorisation of pn 2 is odd ( since 
Pis a prime). 
Since pn2 = m 2 , it appears that the same integer m 2 is expressed as 
the product of an odd number of primes in one representation and as the 
product of an even number of primes in another representation. 
This contradicts uniqueness of the number of prime factors in the 
decompostion. We conclude that /P is not a rational number.

Theorem 3.3.8. (Euclid) The number of primes is infinite. 
Proof. We prove the theorem by contradiction. . 
. 
Let us suppose that the number of primes is ~nite ao<l ~et P be the 
greatest prime. We write the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, • • • in succession and p is 
the last in the enumeration. 
The product 2.3.5 ... p in which every prime appears only once is 
divisible by each prime and therefore the number (2.3.5 · · · P) + 1 is not 
divisible by any of the primes 2, 3, 5, ... , p. 
Hence this number is either itself a prime, or being a composite num-
ber, is divisible by a prime number greater than p. In both the cases 
p fails to be the greatest prime and therefore the number of primes is 
infinite. 
Note. Although the number of primes is infinite, there are arbitrarily 
large gaps in the sequence of primes. For every positive integer k, there 
exist k consecutive composite numbers. To be explicit, each of the k 
consecutive integers 
(k + 1)! + 2, (k + 1)! + 3, ... , (k + 1)! + (k + 1) 
is composite, because (k + 1)! + r is divisible by r if 2 < r < k + 1. 
This indicates that the primes are irregularly spaced in the sequence 
of positive integers. The number of primes less than a positive integer 
x is denoted by 1r(x). No simple formula for determining 1r(x) has yet 
been found. 
Test for primality. 
If a positive integer a be composite, then a = be for integers b, c 
satisfying 1 < b < a, 1 < e < a. Let b < e. Then b2 < be = a and this 
implies b < y'a. 
-
Since b > I, b has at least one prime divisor p and p < b < ..fa,. 
In testing primality of a positive integer n, it is sufficient to divide n 
by primes not exceeding ..Jii,. 
Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes (276 - 494 B.C.) utilised this con· 
cept to find all primes less than a given positive integer n. His device 
is called the "seive of Eratosthenes" which consists in writing all inte-
gers from 2 to n in natural order and then striking out all multiples 
2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, ... of all primes p < y'n. The integers that are left in the 
list ( survived the seive ) are primes. 
For example, in order to determine all primes < 30 the "sieve" 
method is applied by striking all multiples of 2 3 5 from' the table of 
integers from 2 to 30, since 5 is the largest prime' J J3o.

This method has limitations. If the positive integer n be sufficiently 
large, the method becomes impracticable. 
Distribution of primes. 
According to Divison algorithm, all odd positive integers fall into two 
progressions - one containing positive integers of the form 4n + I and 
the other containing positive integers of the form 4n + 3, where n EN. 
It is natural to ask whether the infinitude of primes ultimately fall 
into one particular progression or they are infinitely distributed in both 
the progressions. 
In this respect a more general theorem has been established by Dirich-
let which states that - if a and b are positive integers relatively prime 
then the arithmetic progression a + nb ( n E N) contains infinitely many 
prunes. 
The proof of the general theorem requires analytic method and as 
such it is beyond the scope of the book. In special cases the proofs can 
be carried along the same line as in Euclid's theorem. We consider one 
such. 
Theorem 3.3.9.(Dirichlet) There are infinitely many primes of the 
form 4n -1. 
Proof. We assume that there are only a finite number of primes of the 
form 4n - 1. Let p be the largest prime of that form. 
Let us consider the positive integer N = (22 .3.5 ... p) - 1. The product 
3.5 ... p contains all odd primes < p as divisors. 
Since N is of the form 4n - 1 and N > p, N cannot be a prime, 
because by assumption, p is the largest prime of the form 4n - l. 
As N is composite, N has prime divisors and they are all greater than 
p. All of Them cannot be of the form 4n + 1, because the product of two 
numbers of the form 4n + l is of the same form. 
Therefore some prime divisor of N must be of the form 4n - 1 and 
clearly that prime number is greater than p and this contradicts our 
assumption that p is the largest prime of the form 4n - 1. 
The contradiction proves the theorem.

02 1 ••• 1 0 < Ur < Or . 
The number of such r-tuples is (a1 + l)(a2 + 1) ·· ·(or+ 1). 
Hence the total number of positive divisors of n is ( a1 + 1) ( 02 + 1) · · · ( Or+

If n = I, then there is only one positive divisor. 
Note. The total number of positive divisors (01 + 1)(02 + 1) · · · (ar + 1)

If the canonical form of a positive integer n( > 1) be 
n = Pl 01p2°2 ... Pr Or, where Pl, P2, ... , Pr and distinct

then r(n) = (01 + 1)(02 + 1) ···(or+ 1); and r(l) = 1. 
For example, r(48) = r(24.3) = (4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 10. 
Theorem 3.3.11. The total number of positive divisors of a positive

Proof. Let n( > 1) be a perfect square and let the canonical form of n be 
n = Pl 01 P2 °2 • • • Pr Or, where Pl < P2 < • . ' < Pr and Qi are all positive. 
Then each of 01, 02, ... , Or is an even integer and r(n) = (a1 +l)(a2+ 
1) · · · ( Or + 1) is odd. 
If however, n = 1, a perfect square, then r(n) = 1 and it is odd. 
Conversely, let (01 + l)(a2 + 1) ···(or+ 1) be odd. Then each of the 
factors 01 + 1, 02 + 1, . . • , Or + 1 must be odd. Consequently, each of

This completes the proof.

The odd positive divisors of 2700 are given by the terms of the product

The number of odd positive divisors are (3 + 1)(2 + 1), i.e.,12. 
3. If n = pf 1 p~2 ... p~k , where P1, P2, ... , Pk are primes and ai > 1,

correspondence with the totality of r-tuples ( u1 , u2, ... , Ur), where 0 < 
U1 < 1, 0 < U2 < 1, ... , 0 < Uk < 1. 
The number of such r-tuples is 2k. 
Hence the number of positive square-free divisors of n is 2k. 
4. Find the smallest number having 8 positive divisors. 
8 = 2.2.2 = 22.2 = 23 . 
Let n be a number with 8 positive divisors. 
The factorisation of 8 as 8 = 2.2.2 indicates that the number n is 
of the form p1 .p2 .p3 , where Pl, p2, p3 are distinct primes. For example, 
n = 2.3.7. 
The factorisation of 8 as 8 = 4.2 indicates that nu1nber n is of the 
form pf .p2, where p1, p2 are distinct primes. For example, n = 33 .2. 
The factorisation of 8 as 8 = 8.1 indicates that the number n is of the 
form Pi, where p1 is a prime. For example, n = 21 . 
Therefore the number n is of one of the forms Pl ·P2·P3, pf.p2, Pi, 
where P1, P2, p3 are distinct primes. 
Clearly, the least number with 8 positive divisors is 23 .3 = 24.

Definition. A function whose domain is the set of all positive integers 
is said to be a number-theoretic function ( or an arithmetic function). 
The range of a number-theoretic function need not be the set of all 
positive integers. We shall encounter some simple number-theoretic func-
tions which assume positive integral values. 
The functions rand u are examples of number-theoretic functions. 
A number-theoretic function f is said to be multiplicative if f(mn) == 
f(m)f(n) for all integers m, n such that m, n are prime to each other. 
Theorem 3.3.13. The functions r and a are both multiplicative func-
tions. 
Proof. Let m, n be relatively prime integers. 
r(mn) = r(m)r(n) holds trivially if either mis 1 or n is 1. 
We assume m > 1 and n > 1. 
Let m = Pl 01p2°2 . . . Pr Or and n = q1P1 q2P2 ... q/3,.' 
where Pi, qi are primes and ai > 1, /3j > 1. 
Since m, n are relatively prime, each Pi is different from each Qj·

Definition. Perfect number. A positive integer n is said to be a 
perfect number if u(n) = 2n, i.e., if n be the sum of all its positive 
divisors excluding itself. 
For example, 6 is a perfect number; 28 is another.

2. Find the sum of all even positive divisors of 2700. 
2700 = 22 .33 .52• 
Every positive divisor of 2700 is of the form 
2°1 .3°2 .5°3 , where 0 < 01 < 2, 0 < 02 < 3, 0 < 03 < 2. 
Therefore each term in the product (1+2+22){1+3+32+33)(1+5+52) 
is a positive divisor of 2700 and conversely. 
The even positive divisors of 2700 are given by the different terms of 
the product 
(2 + 22)(1 + 3 + 32 + 33)(1 + 5 + 52). 
The sum of the even positive divisors 
= (2 + 22)(1 + 3 + 32 + 33)(1 + 5 + 52)= 6.40.31 = 7440. 
3. Let k > 1 and 2k - 1 is a prime. If n = 2k-1(2k - 1) then show that 
n is a perfect number. 
2k - 1 is an odd prime, say p. 
u(n) = u(2k-1p) = u(2k-l )u(p), since 2k-l and pare pri.Ip.e_ to each 
other. 
u(2k-l) =I+ 2 + 22 + .. · + 2k-l = 2k - I and u(p) = 1 + p. 
Therefore u(n) = (2k - 1)(1 + p) = (2k - l)2k = 2n. 
This proves that n is a perfect number. 
Note. This example shows that if 2n - 1 ( n > 1) is a prim~. then the 
number 2n-1(2n - 1) is a perfect number.

3.4. Congruence. 
Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), a celebrated German mathemati-
cian, introduced the concept of congruence which laid the foundation of 
modern theory of numbers. 
Definition. Let m be a fixed positive integer. Two integers a and bare 
said to be congruent modulo m if a - b is divisible by m. symbolically 
this is expressed as a = b (mod m). 
To illustrate, let m = 3. It is easy to-verify that 
1 = 
4 (mod 3), -2 = 
1 (mod 3), 6 = 
0 (mod 3), 35 = 2 (mod 3). 
When a - b is not divisible by m, a is said to be incongruent to b 
modulo m. It is expressed as a¢ b (mod m). 
For example, 1 ¢ 5 (mod 3), -2 ¢ 2 (mod 3). 
Note. When m = 1, every two integers are congruent modulo m and 
this case is not so useful and interesting. Therefore m is usually taken 
to be a positive integer greater than 1. 
Theorem 3.4.1. For any two integers a and b, a= b (mod m) if and 
only if a and b leave the same remainder when divided by m. 
Proof. Let r be the remainder when a is divided by m. Then there exists 
some integer q such that a = qm + r, 0 < r < m. 
Since a= b (mod m), a - b = km where k is an integer. 
Therefore b = a - km = (qm + r) - km 
= (q-k)m+r 
and this shows that b leaves the same remainder r. 
Conversely, let r be the same remainder when a and bare divided by m. 
Then a = q1 m + r , b = q2m + r, where Q1, Q2 are integers and O < r < m. 
Therefore (a - b) = (q1 - q2)m, i.e., m I a - b and this proves that 
a= b (mod m). 
To illustrate, let m = 5. Since 21 = 4.5 + 1 and -14 = -3.5 + 1, 
21 and -14 leave the same remainder upon division by 5. Therefore 
21 = -14 (mod 5). 
Properties. 
1. a = a ( mod m). 
2. If a= b (mod m) then b = a (mod m). 
3. If a= b (mod m),b = c (mod m) then a= c (mod m). 

142 
HIGHER ALGEBRA 
4. H a = b ( mod m) then for any integer c 
a + c = b + c (mod m) 
ae = be (mod m). 
5. li a = b ( mod m) and e = d ( mod m) then 
a + e = b + d (mod m) 
ae = bd (mod m). 
6. If a= b (mod m) and dim, d > 0, then a= b (mod d). 
Proofs of properties 1 - 4 and 6 are immediate. 
Proof. 5. a= b (mod m)::::} a - b = km and 
e = d (mod m)::::} e - d = lm, where k, l are integers. 
( a + e) - (b + d) = ( k + l)m. 
Therefore a + e = b + d ( mod m) since k + l is an integer. 
By property 4, 
a - b (mod m)⇒ ae = be (mod m) and 
e = d (mod m)⇒ be= bd (mod m). 
Therefore a= b (mod m) and e = d (mod m)::::} ae = bd (mod m). 
Definition. If a = b ( mod m) then b is said to be a residue of a modulo 
m. 
By division algorithm there exist integers q and r satisfying a = qm+r 
with 0 < r < m - l. 
Since a - r = qm, a = r ( mod m) and this shows that r is a residue 
of a modulo m. r is said to be the least non-negative residue of a modulo 
m. 
Let a be an arbitrary integer. Upon division by m, a leaves one and 
only one of the integers 0, 1, 2, ... , m - 1 as the remainder. 
Therefore whatever the integer a may be, the least non-negative 
residue of a is one and only one of 0, 1, 2, . . . , m - 1. 
The whole set of integers is divided into m distinct and disjoint sub-
sets, called the residue classes modulo m, denoted by O, I, 2, ... , m ..:1 
and defined by 
0 = {0, ±m, ±2m, . .. } 
I = {1, 1 ± m, 1 ± 2m, ... } 
2 = {2, 2 ± m, 2 ± 2m, . .. } 
m -1 = {m - 1, (m - 1) ± m, (m - 1) ± 2m, ... }. 

INTEGERS 
143 
Any two integers in a residue class are congruent modulo m and any 
two integers belonging to two different residue classes are incongruent 
modulo m. 
Theorem 3.4.2. If a= b (mod m) then an= bn (mod m) for all positive 
integers n. 
Proof. We use the principle of induction to prove the theorem. 
The theorem is true for n = 1. 
Let us assume that the theorem is true for some positive integer k. 
Then ak = bk (mod m). 
Nowak= bk (mod m) and a= b (mod m) together imply that 
ak .a= bk .b (mod m), i.e., ak+l = bk+l (mod m). 
This shows that the thoerem is true for the positive integer k + l if 
we assume it to be true fork. 
By the principle of induction, the theorem is true for all positive 
integers n. 
Note. The converse of the theorem fails to hold. 
ak = bk (mod m) does not necessarily imply a= b (mod m). 
For example, 92 = 72 (mod 8) but 9 ¢ 7 (mod 8) 
43 = 73 (mod 9) but 4 ¢ 7 (mod 9). 
Theorem 3.4.3. If ax= ay (mod m) and a is prime tom then x = y 
(mod m). 
Proof. ax - ay = km, where k is an integer 
km 
or,x-y=a· 
Since x - y is an integer, a I km. Since a is prime to m and a I km, 
it follows that a I k. Therefore k = aq where q is an integer. 
Hence x - y = qm and this proves the theorem. 
Note. ax = 
ay ( mod m) does not necessarily imply x = 
y ( mod m). 
For example, 3.2 = 
3.4 (mod 6) does not imply 2 = 
4 (mod 6). 
We can cancel the common factor a freely from both sides of the 
congruence ( mod m) provided a is prime to m. 
3. - 2 = 2 (mod 8), 3.14 = 2 (mod 8). 
Cancelling the factor 3 which is prime to 8 we get the correct congru-
ence -2 = 14 (mod 8). 
Cancellation is allowed however, in some restricted sense which is 
Provided in the following theorem.

Theorem 3.4.4. If d = gcd( a, m) then ax = ay (mod m) <=> x == Y (tnod 
';; ). 
Proof. We have ax - ay = qm where q is an integer. 
Since gcd( a, m) = d, a = dr and m = ds where r and s are integers 
prime to each other. 
Therefore drx - dry = qds 
or, x - Y = !If· 
Since x - y is an integer, r I qs. r is prime to s and r l qs implies r I q,

9.· 
. 
k 
1.e., r 1s an integer . 
Therefore x - y = ks and this says x = y ( mod ';;). 
Conversely, x = y (mod';;)=> 1;; I (x -y) => m I d(x -y) => 
m I a(x -y) =>ax= ay (mod m). 
Corollary. H ax= ay (mod m) and a Im then x = y (mod r;;). 
For example, 4.7 = 4.10 (mod 6). Cancellation of 4 from both sides 
does not give a correct congruence because 4 is not prime to 6. Since 
gcd(4, 6) = 2, we get the correct congruence 
7 = 10 (mod ;). 
Again, 4.7 = 4.10 (mod 12). Since 4 I 12, we get the correct congru-
ence 7 = 10 ( mod 3) from the corollary. 
Theorem 3.4.5. x = 
y (mod mi), for i = 1, 2, ... , r <=> x = 
y (mod m), 
where m = [m1, m2, ... , mr], the lcm of m1, m2, ... , mr. 
Proof. x = y (mod mi) => mi I (x - y), for i = 1, 2, ... , r 
=> x - y is a common multiple of m1, m2, .. . , mr 
=> [ m 1 , m2, ... , mr] I ( x - y) 
=> x = y ( mod m). 
Conversely, x _ y (mod m) => m I (x - y) 
=> m1m2 ... mr I (x - y) 
=> mi I ( x - y), for i = 1, 2, ... , r 
=> x = y ( mod mi), for i = 1, 2, ... , r. 
Corollary. If x = y (mod mi), x = y (mod m2) and m1, m2 are rela-
tively prime then x = y ( mod m 1 m 2). 
Theorem 3.4.6. Let f (x) = anxn + an-ixn-I + ... + a1x + a0 be a 
polynomial with integral coefficients ai. 
If a= b (mod m) then J(a) = J(b) (mod m). 
Proof. Since a = b (mod m), ak = bk (mod m) where k is a positive 
integer. Therefore aiak = aibk (mod m), where ai is an integer. 
Adding these congruences for i = 0, 1, 2, ... , n, we have 
ao + a1a + a2a2 + · · · + anan = ao + a1b + a2b2 + ... + anbn (mod m) 
or, f(a) = f(b) (mod m).

3.4. 7. Divisibility tests. 
1. Let n = amlom + am-1lom-l + ... + a2102 + a110 + ao where ak are 
integers and O < ak < 9, k = 0, 1, ... , m be the decimal representation of 
a positive integer n. 
Let S = ao +a1 + ·· · +am,T = ao - a1 + •·· + (-l)mam, Then 
(i) n is divisible by 2 if and only if a0 is divisible by 2; 
(ii) n is divisible by 9 if and only if Sis divisible by 9; 
(iii) n is divisible by 11 if and only if Tis divisible by 11. 
Proof. Let us consider the polynomial 
f(x) = amxm + am-1Xm-l + · · · + a1x + ao, 
(i) We have 10 = 0 (mod 2). 
Therefore /(10) = f(O) (mod 2). 
But /(10) = n 
and f (O) = ao. 
Therefore n - ao is divisible by 2. 
Hence n is divisible by 2 if and only if a0 is divisible by 2. 
(ii) We have 10 = 1 (mod 9). 
Therefore /(10) = /(1) (mod 9). 
But f (IO) = n 
and f (1) = S. 
Therefore n = S ( mod 9). 
This proves that N - Sis divisible by 9. 
Hence n is divisible by 9 if and only if Sis divisible by 9. 
(iii) We have 10 = -1 (mod 11). 
Therefore /(10) = f(-1) (mod 11). 
But /(10) = n 
and J(-1) = T. 
Therefore n = T (mod 11). 
This proves that n - Tis divisible by 11. 
Hence n is divisible by 11 if and only if Tis divisible by 11. 
For example, 35078571 is divisible by 9 since the sum of the digits 
3 + 5 + O + 7 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 1(= 36) is divisible by 9. 
It is also divisible by 11 because the sum 
1- 7 + 5 - 8 + 7 - O + 5 - 3(= 0) is divisible by 11. 
The number 23572 is divisible by 2, since the integer ao in the units

Let T = ao -

(i) n is divisible by 7 if and only if Tis divisible by 7, 
(ii) n is divisible by 13 if and only if T is divisible by 13, 
(iii) 
n is divisible by 11 if and only if Tis divisible by 11. 
Proof. Let us consider the polynomial 
f(x) = amxm + am-1Xm-l + · · · + a1x + ao. 
(i) We have 1000 = -1 (mod 7) since 1001 = 7.11.13. 
Therefore /(1000) _ /(-1) (mod 7). 
But /(1000) = n 
and /(-1) = T. 
Therefore n = T ( mod 7). 
This implies n - Tis divisible by 7. 
Hence n is divisible by 7 if and only if T is divisible by 7. 
(ii) and (iii) 
Similar proofs. 
To illustrate, let us consider the number n = 23146123. n can be 
expressed as 23(1000)2 + 146(1000) + 123. 
n is divisible by 7 because the sum 123 - 146 + 23 = 0 is divisible by 
7. 
The same argument proves that n is also divisible by 13 and 11.

1. Find the least positive residues in 336 (mod 77). 
34 = 4 (mod 77) =;- 312 = 43 (mod 77) = -13 (mod 77). 
This gives 324 = 169 (mod 77) = 15 (mod 77). 
Therefore 336 = 15. - 13 (mod 77) = 36 (mod 77). 
Hence the least positive residue is 36. 
2. Use the theory of congruences to prove that 7 I 2sn+3 + 52n+3 for all

2sn+3 + 52n+3 = 8.32n + 125.25n. 
32n - 25n _ 0 (mod 7) for all n > 1. 
Therefore 8.32n - 8.25n = 0 (mod 7) for all n > 1. 
Also we have 133(25)n = 0 (mod 7) for all n > 1. 
Therefore 8.32n + 125.25n = 0 (mod 7) for all n > 1. 
This implies 7 I 25n+3 + 52n+3 for all n > 1.

3.4.8. Linear congruence. 
Let /(x) = a0xn + a1xn-l + · • • + an(n > 1) be a polynomial with 
integer coefficients ao, a1 , ... , an with ao ~ 0 ( mod m). Then / ( x) = 0 
(mod m) is said to be a polynomial congruence (mod m) of degree n. 
If there exists an integer x0 such that J(xo) = 0 (mod m), then x0 is 
said to be a solution of the congruence. 
By earlier theorems, if x1 be any integer satisfying x1 -
xo (mod 
m), then we also have /(x1) -
0 (mod m), showing that x1 is another 
solution of the congruence. 
Thus if one solution be found then infinitely many solutions can be 
obtained, but all these solutions belong to the same xa-residue class mod-
ulo m and they are not counted as different solutions. 
Two solutions x1, x 2 of f ( x) = 0 ( mod m) are said to be distinct 
solutions if x1 ~ x 2 ( mod m). 
Therefore, by the number of solutions of a congruence ( mod m) we 
mean the number of solutions incongruent in pairs. 
For example, let us consider the congruence x2 = 1 (mod 8). x = 1

is a solution of the congruence and all soluti~ns congruent to 1 (tnod S) 
i.e., x = 1 + Bk, k being an integer, are solutions of the congruence. 
1 
x = 3 is a solution of the congruence and all solutions congruent 
to 3 (mod 8), i.e., x = 3 + 8k, k being an integer are solutions of the 
congruence. 
Similarly, x = 5, x = 7 are solutions of the congruence. 
These four solutions of the congruence are distinct, because no two 
of the solutions are congruent modulo 8. 
There cannot be more than m distinct solutions of the congruence 
since there are only m different residue classes. If m is small it is an eas; 
job to find all the distinct solutions by direct substitution x = 1, x == 2 , 
,x=m-1. 
There are many points of difference between a polynomial congruence 
modulo a positive integer m > 1 and the polynomial equation over the 
field of complex numbers. 
A congruence may have no solution. For example, the congruence 
x 2 = 3 (mod 5) has no solution which can be established by directly 
verifying that none of x = 0, x = 1, x = 2, x = 3, x = 4 satisfies the 
congruence. In contrast, a polynomial equation has always a solution. 
A congruence may have more distinct solutions than its degree. For 
example, the congruence x2 = 1 (mod 8) has four distinct solutions 
x = 1,x = 3, x = 5, x = 7. In contrast, a polynomial equation of degree 
m over the complex field has exactly m solutions. 
There is an explicit method of solving a congruence of any degree 
modulo a positive integer m > 1. Llust by substitution of each of the 
integers 1, 2, .. . , m - 1, in turn.] But there is no such explicit method 
for solving a polynomial equation of degree greater than 4. 
Definition. 
A polynomial congruence of degree 1 is said to be a linear congruence. 
The general form of a linear congruence modulo a positive integer m > 1 
is ax= b (mod m), where a¢ 0 (mod m ). 
An integer c is said to be a solution of the linear congruence ax :::: b 
(mod m) if ac = b (mod m). 
Theorem 3.4.9. If x1 be a solution of the linear congruence ax== b 
(mod m) and if x2 = x1 (mod m), then x 2 is also a solution of the 
congruence. 

INTEGERS 
proof. x1 is a solution=> ax1 = b (mod m). 
x2 = x1 (mod m) => ax2 = ax1 (mod m) 
=> ax2 = b (mod m). 
149 
This shows that x2 is a solution of the congruence ax= b (mod m). 
Note. If x 1 be a solution of the congruence ax= b (mod m) then x1 +..\m 
is also a solution for..\= 0, ±1, ±2, .... All these solutions belong to one 
residue class modulo m and these are not counted as different solutions. 
Theorem 3.4.10. If gcd(a, m) = 1, then the linear congruence ax= b 
(mod m) has a unique solution. 
Proof. Since gcd( a, m) = 1, there exist integers u and v such that au + 
mv = 1. Therefore a(bu) + m(bv) = b. This gives a(bu) = b (mod m). 
This shows that x = bu is a solution of the congruence ax = b ( mod 
m). 
Let x1, x2 be solutions of the congruence ax= b (mod m). 
Then ax1 = b (mod m) and ax2 = b (mod m). 
Therefore ax1 = ax2 (mod m) and this implies x 1 = x2 (mod m), 
since gcd(a, m) = 1. 
This proves that the congruence has a unique solution. 
Note. The solutions are x = bu+ ..\m, where ..\ = 0, ±1, ±2, ... and they 
all belong to one· and only one residue class modulo m. 
Theorem 3.4.11. If gcd(a, m) = d, then the linear congruence ax= b 
(mod m) has no solution if d is not a divisor of b. 
H d be a divisor of b, then the linear congruence ax = b ( mod m) has 
d incongruent solutions (mod m). 
Proof. Let ax= b (mod m) has a solution x = u. Then au= b (mod m) 
and this implies m I ( b - au). 
d Im=> d I (b - au). d I a and d I (b - au) =>dis a divisor of b. 
Contrapositively, dis not a divisor of b implies ax= b (mod m) has no 
solution. 
Second part. d I b. For an integer u, au= b (mod m) holds if and only 
if a 
b 
du= -a (mod r;;), by Theorem 3.4.4. 
. gcd( ~, d) = 1 and therefore the congruence ~u = ~ {mod 7) has 
Just one solution u = x 1 (mod d ). 
J_n other words, the solution of the congruence ~u = ~ (mod ';;) are 
the integers u = x1 (mod d ), i.e., u = xi + ';It, t = 0, ±1, ±2, ...

t1 ';; = t2 r;J (mod m). 
gcd(';;, m) = d =>ti= t2 (mod d) => d I t2 -
t1. 
This is an impossibility, because O < t2 - t1 < d. 
Thus all solutions in the list (i) are incongruent modulo m. 
Let any other solution be x 1 + ti d, where ti is an integer other than 
0,1, ... ,d-l. 
By Divison algorithm we can write ti = qd + r, where q and r are 
integers and O < r < d- 1. 
Then x1 + tj d = x1 + (qd + r) d = x1 + rr:; (mod m). 
Since O < r < d - I, x1 + ti d is one of the solutions listed in (i). 
Thus the congruence ax = b ( mod m) has d incongruent solutions 
listed in (i). 
This completes the proof.

The solutions belong to a single residue class modulo j

I. Solve the linear congruence 5x = 3 ( mod 11). 
gcd(5, 11) = l. Hence the congruence has a unique solution. 
Since gcd(5, 11) = 1, there exist integers u, v such that 5u + llv::;; 1· 
Here u = -2, v = I. Therefore 5.(-2) + 11.1 = 1 and this implies 
5.(-2) = 1 (mod 11). Therefore 5.(-6) = 3 (mod 11). 
Hence x = -6 is a solution. 
All solutions are x = -6 (mod 11), i.e., x = 5 (mod 11). 
All the solutions are congruent to 5 ( mod 11) and therefore the gi"eJl

2. Solve the linear congruence 15x = 9 (mod 18). 
gcd(15, 18) = 3 and 3 I 9. Therefore the given congruence has a 
solution. The given congruence is equivalent to 5x = 3 (mod 6). 
gcd(5, 6) = 1. Hence the congruence 5x = 3 (mod 6) has a unique 
solution. 
Since gcd(5, 6) = 1, there exist integers u, v such that 5u + 6v = 1. 
Here u = -1, v = 1. Therefore 5.(-1) + 6.1 = 1 and this implies 
5.(-1) = 1( mod 6). Therefore 5.(-3) = 3 (mod 6). Hence x = -3 is a 
solution of the congruence 5x = 3 (mod 6). 
There are three incongruent solutions of the given congruence. They 
are x = -3, -3 + 6, -3 + 12 modulo 18, i.e., x = -3, 3, 9 (mod 18). 
System of linear congruences. 
Let us consider the linear congruences 
a1x = 
b1 (mod m1), a2x = 
b2 (mod m2), · · ·, arx = 
br (mod mr) 
and let us enquire if it be possible to have a simultaneous solution of 
the congruences. In that case each individual congruence must have a 
solution. 
Let gcd(ai, mi) = di for i = 1, 2, ... , r. Then di must be a divisor of 
bi for each i. 
Cancelling di from the ith equation, the system reduces to 
a~x = b~ (mod m~), a~x = b~ (mod m;), .. ·, a~x _ b~ (mod m~), 
where dia~ = ai, dib~ = bi, ... , dim~ = mi and gcd(a~, mD = 1 for 
i=l,2, ... ,r. 
Each individual congruence has a unique solution of the form xi = Ci 
(mod mi ). 
Thus the problem is reduced to one of finding a common solution of 
the system 
x = c1 (mod m1), x = c2 (mod m2), · · ·, x = Cr (mod mr), 
The kind of problems that can be reduced to a system of linear con-
gruences was found in Chinese literature as early as first century A.D . .In 
later periods such problems were also found in other countries. Because 
of their antiquity, this type of problem goes by. the name of "Chinese 
remainder theorem" . 
The method of congruence that is used to state the problem and to 
make the proof in a concise form was unknown to the ancients.

has a simultaneous solution which is unique modulo m1m2 ... mr, [i.e., if 
Xo be a solution then x = x0 + k(m1m2,-•mr) is also a solution, where k 
is an integer.] 
Proof. Let m = m1m2 ... mr. Let Mk = ;::k, k = 1, 2, ... , r. 
Then gcd(Mk, mk) = 1 for k = 1, 2, ... , r. 
This implies that the linear congruence Mkx = 1 (mod mk) has a 
unique solution modulo mk, Let Xk be the solution. 
Then Mkxk = 1 (mod mk) and clearly, Mkxk = 0 (mod mi) for j # k. 
Therefore ckMkXk = Ck (mod mk) and ckMkXk = 0 (mod mi) for j # k. 
Let us consider the integer xo = c1M1x1 + c2M2x2 + · · · + CrMrxr, 
xo = c1 (mod m1), since c1M1x1 = c1 (mod m1) and c;M;xi = 0

Similarly, xo =

This shows that xo is a solution of the given system of congruences. 
Let x' be any solution of the system of congruences.

Consequently, x' = xo (mod m1m2 ... mr)

Let M1 = '; = 140, M2 = ~ = 105, Ma = '; = 84, M4 = "f! = 60.

to finding a simultaneous solution of the congruences 32x = 79 (mod

m2)# a= b (mod [m1, m2D-
32x = 79 (mod 25) is equivalent to 7x.= 4 (mod 25). 
gcd(7,25) = 1. We have 7.(-7). + 25.2 = 1. 1:herefore 7.(-7) == 1 
(mod 25) and therefore 7.(-28) = 4 (mod 25). This shows that 7x == 4 
(mod 25) is equivalent to x = -28 (mod 25), i.e., x = 22 (mod 25). 
32x = 79 (mod 49) is equivalent to 32x = 30 (mod 49) which is again 
equivalent to 16x = 15 (mod 49). 
gcd(16, 49) = 1. We have 16.(-3) + 49.1 = 1. Therefore 16.(-3) == 1 
(mod 49) and therefore 16.(-45) = 15 (mod 49). This shows that 16x = 
15 (mod 49) is equivalent to x = -45 (mod 49), i.e., x = 4 (mod 49). 
We now solve the system of congruences 
x = 22 (mod 25), x = 4 (mod 49). 
Let m = 25.49. Let M1 =;;, = 49, M2 = ~ = 25. 
Since gcd(M1 , 25) = 1, the congruence 49x = 1 (mod 25) has a unique 
solution. 
We have 49.(-1) + 25.2 = 1. Therefore 49.(-1) = 1 (mod 25) and 
therefore the unique solution is x1 = 24 (mod 25). 
Since gcd(M2, 49) = 1, the congruence 25x = 1 (mod 49) has a unique 
solution. Proceeding similarly, the unique solution is x 2 = 2 (mod 49).

If we choose s such that pc + s = d2u, where u is an integer then 
c + d1s = d2(ud1 + qc) = d2v, where v is an integer and in that case

simultaneous solution. Solve the system. 
Here the moduli of the congruences 15 and 35 are not prime to each 
other. gcd(15, 35) = 5 and 11 - 6 is divisible by gcd(15, 35). Therefore 
the congruences have a simultaneous solution. 
The general solution of the first congruence has the form 
· x = 11 + 15s, wheres is an integer 
= 6 + 5(1 + 3s) ... (i) 
The general solution of the second congruence has the form 
x = 6 + 35t = 6 + 5. 7t, where t is an integer ... 
(ii)

n that case (i) and (ii) become identical. 
The common solution is

x = 6 + 5[1 + 3(2 + 7u)] = 41 + 105u, where u is an integer. 
Therefore the solution is given by x = 41 (mod 105). 
Another method 
The congruence x = 11 (mod 15) is equivalent to two simultaneoUs 
congruences x = 11 (mod 3), x = 11 (mod 5). 
The congruence x = 6 (mod 35) is equivalent to two simultaneous 
congruences x = 6 (mod 7), x = 6 (mod 5). 
Thus the given system is equivalent to four simultaneous congruences 
x = 11 (mod 3), x = 11 (mod 5), x = 6 (mod 7), x = 6 (mod 5). 
It is observed that the congruences x = ll(mod 5) and x = 6 (mod 
5) are consistent, because each is equivalent to x = 1 (mod 5). 
The congruence x = 11 (mod 3) is equivalent to x = 2 (mod 3). 
Thus the given system is equivalent to three simultaneous congruences 
x = 2 (mod 3), x = 1 (mod 5), x = 6 (mod 7) of which the moduli are 
pairwise prime to each other. 
Using the method discussed in the theorem, 
xo = 2.(35.2) + 1.(2i.1) + 6.(15.1) = 251 is a solution. 
The solution of the given system is x = 251 (mod 105), which is 
equivalent to x = 41 (mod 105). 
There is an extension of the above theorem to a finite set of linear 
congruences. The theorem is stated below without proof. 
Theorem 3.4.14. 
Let m1, m2, ... , mr be positive integers and 
a1, a2, ... , ar be any integers. Then the system of linear congruences 
x = a1 (mod m1), x = 
a2 (mod m2), ... , x = ar (mod mr) 
will have a simultaneous solution if and only if a. - a . is divisible by

gcd( mi, mj) whenever i =/= j; and if this condition be satisfied the solution 
is unique modulo lcm(m1, m2, .. . , mr ). [i.e., the solutions form a single 
congruence class modulo lcm( m1, m2, ... , mr).) 
For example, the system of congruences x = 2 (mod 3), x = 3 (II1°d 
5), x = 4 (mod 6) has no solution, since 4-2 is not divisible by gcd(3,6)· 
The solution of the congrue~ces x = 2 (mod 3), x = 3 (mod 5i5~ 
x = 8 (mod 15). Therefore the given system reduces to x = 8 (mod . 1 
x = 4 (mod 6) and this system has no solution, since 8- 4 is not divisib e 
by gcd(15, 6).

3.5. Phi function. 
Definition. The function ¢, called Euler's phi function (Euler's totient 
function), is defined for all positive integers by 
</>(1) = 1 and for n > 1, 
</>( n) = the number of positive integers less than n and prime to n. 
For example, let n = 8, 20. 
The positive integers less than 8 and prime to 6 are 1, 3, 5, 7. Therefore 
</>(8) = 4. 
The positive integers less than 20 and prime to 20 are 1, 3, 7, 9, ll, 
13, 17, 19. Therefore ¢(20) = 8. 
If p be a prime then every positive integer less than p is prime to P· 
Therefore <f>(p) = p - 1. 
Note. The function¢ is a number-theoretic function. 

INTEGERS

Theorem 3.5.1. The function¢ is a multiplicative function. That is, if 
m and n be relatively prime integers, then ¢( mn) = ¢( m )¢( n). 
First we prove the following lemmas. 
Lemma 1. a is prime to mn if and only if a is prime to m and a is prime 
ton. 
Proof. Let a be prime to mn and d = gcd(a, m). Then d I a and d Im 
and this implies d I mn. 
Therefore gcd( a, mn) > d, but gcd( a, mn) = 1 by assumption. 
Hence d = 1 proving that a is prime to m. By similar arguments, a 
is prime ton. 
Conversely, let a be prime to m and a be prime to n. Since a is prime to 
m, there exist integers u and v such that au + mv = 1. Since a is prime 
to n, there exist integers p and q such that ap + nq = 1. 
We have anuq + mnvq = nq = 1 - ap 
or, a(nuq + p) + mn(vq) = 1. 
Since nuq + p and vq are integers, it follows that a is prime to mn. 
Lemma 2. If r be the residue of a modulo n and r is prime ton, then 
a is prime to n. 
Since gcd(qn + r, n) = gcd(r, n), the lemma follows. 
Lemma 3. If c be an integer and a is prime ton, then the number of 
integers in the set 
{ c, c + a, c + 2a, ... , c + (n - l)a} that are prime to 
n is </>(n). 
Proof. No two integers of the set are congruent modulo n, because 
c + sa = c + ta ( mod n) 
0 < s < t < n - 1 
=> s = t ( mod n), a contradiction. 
Therefore the set of integers is congruent modulo n to 0, 1, 2, ... , n-1 
in some order. Since the number of integers among 0, 1, 2, ... , n -1 that 
are prime to n is ¢( n), the lemma follows. 
Proof of the theorem. 
Since ¢(1) = 1, the theorem is trivially true when m or n equals 1. 
Let us assume m > 1, n > I. We arrange mn integers in n rows and m 
columns as follows: 
1 
m+l 
2m+l 
(n- l)m+ 1 
2 
m+2 
2m+2 
(n- l)m + 2

The number of integers among thes~ that are.prime to mn is ¢(rnn). 
By lemma 1, these integers are both pnme tom and n. 
The number of integers in the first row that are prime ~o m: is ¢( ni). 
By lemma 2, each integer in the column of r(l <. r < m) 18 _Prime to ni 
if r is prime to m. So there are </>( m) columns of integers prime to rn. 
Again by lemma 3, each column in the ~rrangement contains ¢(n) 
integers prime to n. Therefore the number of integers those are Prime to 
m as well as n is </>(m).</>(n). 
This completes the proof. 
Note. </>( m1 m2 ... mr) = </>( m1 )</>( m2) ... </>( mr), where m1, m2, ... , mr 
are pairwise prime. 
Theorem 3.5.2. If p be a prime and k be a positive integer, 
</>(pk) = pk(l _ 1 ). 
p 
Proof. 
The positive integers < pk which are not prime to pk are 
p, 2p, 3p, ... , (pk-l )p. Therefore the number of positive integers less than 
pk and prime to pk is pk - pk-l. 
Hence <f>(pk) = pk - pk-l = pk(l - }). 
Theorem 3.5.3. If n = p~1p~2 ... p~r where p1,P2, ... ,Pr are prime to

Some properties of phi function.

½n.</>(n). 

INTEGERS 
161 
Proof. Let a be a positive integer less than n and prime to n. Then 
au+ nv = 1 for some integers u and v. 
Therefore n(v+u)+(n-a)(-u) = 1. Since u+v and -u are integers, 
it follows that n - a is also a positive integer less than n and prime to 
n. Therefore </>( n) positive integers less than n and prime to n can be 
expressed as a1, a2, a3, ... , (n - a3), (n - a2), (n - a1). 
Let S = a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + (n - a3) + (n - a2) + (n - a1)-
Then S = (n - ai) + (n - a2) + (n - a3) + ... + a3 + a2 + a1. (sum 
in the reverse order) 
Adding, we have 2S = </>(n).n, or, S = ½n.<f>(n). 
2. For any positive integer n, n = E </>( d), where the summation extends 
din 
over all positive divisors d of n. 
Proof. Let S = {1, 2, ... , n }, n > 1. Let d1, d2, ... , dk be positive divisors 
of n. For a divisor d of n, let us define a subset Sd of S by 
Sd = {a ES: gcd(a,n) = d}. 
Then each element of S belongs to exactly one of the subsets 
Sd1, 8d2, • • • , sdk and s = sd1 LJ sd2 LJ •. • LJ sdk • 
Let d < n. a E Sd => gcd(a, n) = d =>a= )..d and n = d'd, where).. 
is less than d' ( = ~) and prime to d'. 
Thus Sd contains integers of the type >-.d, where).. is less than d' and 
prime to d'. Therefore Sd contains </>( d') elements. 
Since the total number of elements in S is n and they are distributed 
into distinct and disjoint subsets of S, n = E <f>(d'), where dd' = n. 
din 
As d runs through all positive divisors of n, d' does so. 
Therefore E <f>(d') = E </>(d') = E </>(d). If n = 1, E </>(d) = </>(1) = 1.

This completes the proof. 
To elucidate the proof, let us take n = 15. The divisors of 15 are 
1, 3, 5 and 15. 
81 = {a: gcd(a, 15) = 1} = {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14}; 
83 ={a: gcd(a, 15) = 3} = {3, 6, 9, 12}; 
85 ={a: gcd(a, 15) = 5} = {5, 10}; 
815 ={a: gcd(a, 15) = 15} = {15}. 
81 contains </>(15) elements, 83 contains </>(5) elements, Ss contains 
¢(3) elements and S15 contains </>(1) elements. 
</>(1) = 1, </>(3) = 2, </>(5) = 4, q,(15) = 8.

3. If n > 2 then cp(n) is an even integer. 
Proof. Case 1. Let n be a power of 2. Let n = 2k, ~ > 1. 
Then </>(n) = </>(2k) = 2k(l _ ½) = 2k-l, an even integer. 
Case 2. Let n be not a power of 2. Then n has an odd prime divisor, 
say, p. Let n = p0 q, where a> 1 and p, q are prime to each other. 
Then cp(n) = cp(p0 ).cp(q), since p0 , q are prime to each other 
= p0 (1- l ).cp(q) = p0 - 1(p - l).cp(q). 
Since (p - 1) is even, it follows that </>( n) is even. 
This completes the proof. 
Another proof of Euclid's theorem on infinitude of primes. 
Let the number of primes be finite and P1, P2, ... , Pm be the enumer-
ation of all primes. Let p = P1P2 ... Pm· 
Let k be an integer satisfying 2 < k < p. Then by the fundamental 
theorem, k is either a prime, i.e., one of P1, P2, ... , Pm, or k has a prime 
divisor, say q which is one of Pl, P2, . .. , Pm. 
Thus in any case, gcd(k,p) > 1. Therefore every integer k satisfying 
1 < k < p is not prime to p and this gives cp(p) = 1. 
But p is clearly an integer > 2 and by the property of the phi function, 
</>( n) is even for every integer n > 2. We arrive at a contradiction. 
Therefore the number of primes is infinite and this completes the proof. 
Worked Examples. 
1. Find the number of integers less than n and prime ton, when n == 
324,900. 
324 = 22.34 • Therefore </>(324) = 324(1- ½)(1- ½) = 108. 
900 = 22.32.52. Therefore </>(900) = 900(1- ½)(1- ½)(1- ½) = 240. 
2. If n be an odd positive integer, prove that cp(2n) = ¢(n). 
Since n is odd, gcd(2, n) = 1. 
Therefore ¢(2n) = ¢(2)¢(n) = </>(n), since ¢(2) = 1. 
3. If n be an even positive integer, prove that ¢(2n) = 2¢(n). 
Let n = 2k .p, where pis an odd positive integer. 
Then </>(n) = ¢(2k).¢(p) = 2k(l - ½).¢(p) = 2k- 1¢(p) and 
¢(2n) = cp(2k+1p) = ¢(2k+l )</>(p) = 2k</>(p). Therefore cp(2n) = 2cp(n).

If p be a prime and pis not a divisor of a, then aP-1 -

proof. Let us consider the integers a, 2a, 3a, . . . , (p _ 1 )a. 
None of these is_ divisible by p. Also no two of these are congruent 
Illodulo P, because if ra = sa. (mod p) for some integers r, s satisfying 
1 < r < s < P - 1, then c~ncelhng a ( since a is prime to p) we must have 
r == s ( mod p), a contradiction. 
This means that the integers a, 2a, 3a, .. . , (p - l)a are congruent to 
1, 2, 3, ... , p - 1 modulo p, taken in some order. 
Therefore a.2a.3a .... (p - l)a = 1.2.3 . ... (p - 1) (mod p) 
or, 
aP-1(p - 1)! - (p - 1)! (mod p). 
Since gcd(p, (p - 1)!) = 1, this is equivalent to aP-1 = 1 (mod p). 
This completes the proof. 
Note. This theorem is popularly known as "Fermat's Little Theorem" 
to distinguish it from Fermat's "Great Theorem" or "Last Theorem", 
which states that "if n > 2, then the Diophantine equation xn + yn = zn 
has no solution in integers, other than the trivial solution in which at 
least one of the variables is zero." 
Note. The theorem may be stated in a more general form -
If p be a prime and a is any integer, aP = a ( mod p). 
When p is not a divisor of a, aP-1 = 1 ( mod p) and in this case aP = a 
(mod p) holds. And when pis a divisor of a, aP = 0 (mod p) and it can 
be expressed as aP = a ( mod p). 
Corollary. Since p is a prime, p - 1 is an even integer except when 
p = 2. Therefore (aP;-

. As an application of the corollary, let us take p = 7. Then for any 
integer a not divisible by 7, 
a 3 is either 7k + 1 or 7k - 1. 
When a is divisible by 7, 
a 3 = 7k. 
It follows that for any integer a, a3 is one of the forms 7k, 7k ± 1,

Theorem 3.5.5. Euler's theorem. 
H n be a positive integer and a is prime ton, then a<l>(n) = 1 (mod n). 
Proof. 
The theorem holds trivially if n = 1. 
Let_ n > 1 and let 
a1 , a2 , ••• , a<t>(n) be positive integers less than n and prime ton. 
Let us consider the integers aa1, aa2, • • • , aa</>(n)· Each of these is 
prime to n, since gcd( a, n) = 1 and gcd( ai, n) = 1 =} gcd( aai, n) == 1. 
No two of the integers aa1,aa2, ... ,aa</>(n) are congruent modulo n 
because aai = aai (mod n) => ai = ai (mod n), since gcd(a, n) = 1, hui 
ai ¢. ai (mod n). 
Therefore the integers aa1, aa2, .. . , aarp(n) contain exactly ¢(n) ele-
ments and they are congruent to the integers a1, a2, . •. , a<l>(n) modulo n 
in some order. 
Multiplying the ¢( n) congruences, we have 
aa1.aa2 . .. aac/>(n) = a1,a2 .. . aq,(n) (mod n). 
Since gcd(ai, n) = 1 for each i, it follows that gcd(a1a2 ... a<t>(n), n) = 1. 
Therefore we can cancel a1a2 ... a</>(n) from both sides of the congruence 
and obtain a<t>(n) - 1 (mod n). 
· This completes the proof. 
Note 1. Euler's theorem is a generalisation of Fermat's theorem. 
Euler's theorem holds for any integer n. If, in particular, n be a 
prime, then ¢( n) = n - 1 and in that case, for any integer a prime to n, 
Euler's theorem gives an-l = 1 (mod n). 
Note 2. If m be a positive integer and gcd( a, m) = 1, the linear congru-
ence ax= 1 (mod m) has a unique solution (mod m). Euler's theorem 
suggests a method of finding such a solution. Since a<l>(m) = 1 (mod m), 
the unique solution is given by x = a<l>(m)-I (mod m). 
Theorem 3.5.6. Wilson's theorem. 
If p be a prime, then (p - 1)! + 1 = 0 (mod p). 
Proof. 
Let a be one of the integers 1, 2, 3, ... ,P - 1. Then no two of 
the integers La, 2.a, 3.a, .. . , (p - 1 )a are congruent modulo p, because if 
ra = sa (mod p) for some integers r, s satisfying 1 < r < s < p - l, 
then cancelling a ( since a is prime to p) we must have r = s( mod P), 6 
contradiction. Also none of these is divisible by p. 
This means that the integers a, 2a, 3a, ... , (p _ l)a are congruent to 
1, 2, 3, • • • ,p-1 modulo P, taken in some order. Hence for every a, there

is one a', and only one, such that a' a = l ( mod p). 
a2 = 1 (mod P) holds if P I ( a2 - 1) and this happens only when 
p I (a - 1) or PI (a+ 1). Since pis a prime and a< p, it follows that in 
this case either a= 1 or a= p - 1. 
Therefore 1 and p-1 are the only values of a for which a.a= 1 (mod 
p). 
If we omit integers 1 and p - 1, the remaining integers 2, 3, ... ,P - 2 
are such that they are grouped into pairs a, a' for which a.a' = 1 (mod 
p) holds. Multiplying ½(P - 3) pairs of such congruences, we have 
2.3 ... (p - 2) = 1 (mod p) 
or, (p - 2)! = 1 (mod p). 
Multiplying by p- 1, (p-1)! = p - l (mod p)= -1 (mod p) which is 
equivalent to (p- 1)! + 1 = 0 {mod p). 
This completes the proof. 
Let us take an example to elucidate the proof of the theorem. 
Let p = 11. Then the integers 1, 2, 3, ... , 10 are grouped into pairs 
a, a' such that a.a' = 1 (mod 11). 
1.1 = 1 (mod 11), 2.6 = 1 (mod 11), 3.4 = 1 {mod 11), 
5.9 = 1 (mod 11), 7.8 = 1 (mod 11), 10.10 = 1 (mod 11). 
Omitting the first and the last and multiplying the remaining, 
9! = 1 (mod 11) 
or, 10! = 10 (mod 11)= -1 (mod 11) 
or, 
10! + 1 = 0 (mod 11). 
Note 1. The converse of Wilson's theorem is also true. 
If (p - 1)! + 1 = O (mod p) then p must be prime. For, if p be not 
a prime, then p has a divisor d with 1 < d < p such that d divides 
(p - 1) ! + 1. Again since 1 < d < p, d divides one of the factors in 
(p- 1)!. Therefore d divides both (p- 1)! + 1 and (p - 1)! which yields 
d I 1, an absurdity. 
Note 2. Wilson's theorem and its converse, taken together, provide a 
necessary and sufficient condition for determining primality of a positive 
integer n. But this test is impracticable since ( n - 1) ! becomes very large 
as n assumes large values. 
We now come to a theorem of Dirichlet that establishes the existence 
of infinity of primes in the arithmetic progression 1 + 4n, n E N.

HIGHER ALGEBRA 
Theorem 3.5. 7. (Dirichlet) There are infinitely many primes of the 
form 4n+ 1. 
Proof. Let N be any positive integer. We shall show that there exists a 
prime > N of the form 4n + 1. 
Let m = (N!)2 + 1. Then mis odd and m > 1. None of the numbers 
2, 3, ... , N is a divisor of m. Let p be the smallest prime divisor of rn. 
Thenp > N. 
We have (N!)2 = -1 (mod p). 
Therefore (N!)P-1 = (-1)9 (mod p). 
But (N!)P-1 = 1 (mod p), by Fermat's theorem. 
Hence (-l)E? = 1 (mod p). 
(-1) p;i is either 1 or -1. If (-1)9 = -1, then -1 = 1 (mod p) 
must hold. But it is an impossibility, since p is odd. Therefore ( -1) ~ 
is 1 and therefore P; 1 is even. That is, p = I ( mod 4). 
Thus for every positive integer N there exists a prime p > N such 
that p = I ( mod 4) and consequently, the number of primes of the form 
4n + 1 is infinite. 
This completes the proof. 
Worked Examples. 
1. Find the least positive residue in 241 (mod 23). 
23 is a prime and 2 is prime to 23. 
By Fermat's theorem, 
222 = 1 (mod 23). 
Therefore 244 = 1 ( mod 23)= 24 ( mod 23) 
or, 241.8 = 3.8 (mod 23). 
Since 8 is prime to 23, we have 241 = 3 (mod 23). 
Hence the least positive residue is 3. 
2. If p be a prime> 2, prove that lP + 2P + ... + (p _ l)P = o (mod p). 
By Fermat's theorem, 
IP= 1 (mod p), 2P = 2 (mod p), ... , (p - l)P = p _ 1 (mod p). 
Adding the congruences, we have

3. Prove that the eighth power of any integer is of the form 17 k or 
17k ± 1. 
If a be an integer divisible by 17 then aB = 17k. 
If a is not divisible by 17 then a is prime to 17. 
By Fermat's theorem, 
a16 - 1 = O (mod 17) 
or, 
(a8 - l)(a8 + 1) = 0 (mod 17). 
Either a 8 - 1 = 0 (mod 17), or a8 + 1 = O (mod 17). 
a8 -1 = 0 (mod 17) implies a8 = 17k + 1; 
a8 + 1 = 0 (mod 17) implies a8 = 17k- l. 
Hence a8 = 17k or 17k ± 1 where a is an integer. 
4. Show that a12 - b12 is divisible by 91 if a and bare both prime to 91. 
Since a is prime to 91, a is prime to both 13 and 7. 
By Fermat's theorem, 
a12 - 1 = 0 (mod 13) and a6 - 1 = 0 (mod 7). 
Since a6 - 1 = 0 (mod 7), it follows that a 12 - 1 = O (mod 7). 
Now a 12 - 1 = 0 (mod 13) and a 12 - 1 = 0 (mod 7) together imply 
a12 - 1 = 0 (mod 91), since 13 and 7 are prime to each other. 
Similarly, b12 - 1 = 0 (mod 91). 
Therefore a12 - b12 = 0 (mod 91). 
5. If n is a prime > 7, prove that n6 - 1 is divisible by 504. 
Since 7 is a prime and n is prime to 7, n6 - 1 is divisible by 7, by 
Fermat's theorem. 
Since n is prime to 9, n<l>(9) - 1 is divisible by 9, by Euler's theorem. 
¢,(9) = 9.(1 - ½) = 6. Therefore n6 - 1 is divisible by 9. 
Since n is an odd prime > 7, n is one of the forms 4k + 1 or 4k + 3, 
where k is an integer > 1. 
n6 - 1 = (n - l)(n + l)(n4 + n2 + 1). 
IT n = 4k + 1, then (n - l)(n + 1) = 4k(4k + 2). It is divisible by 8. 
If n = 4k + 3, then (n - l)(n + 1) = (4k + 2)(4k + 4). It is divisible 
by 8. 
Therefore in any case, n6 - 1 is diYisible by 8.

b5)(b5 - c5)(c5 - a5 ) is divisible by 11 for all 
integers a, b, c. 
Case 1. Let one of a, b, c be divisible by 11. 
Then abc is divisible by 11 and therefore abc(a5 -b5)(b5 -c5)(c5 -as) 
is divisible by 11 
Case 2. Let none of a, b, c be divisible by 11. 
By Fermat's theorem, a10 - 1 = 0 (mod 11). Then lll(a5 - l)(a5+1). 
Since 11 is a prime, either lll(a5 - 1) or lll(a5 + 1). 
Therefore a5 when divided by 11, leaves remainder 1 or 10. 
Since the fifth power of any integer, not divisible by 11, leaves only 
one of the two possible remainders 1 or 10 when divided by 11, at least 
two of a5 , b5 , c5 must leave the same remainder when divided by 11. 
So one of (a5 - b5), (b5 - c5) and (cs - a5 ) is divisible by 11. 
Therefore (a5 - bs)(bs - c5)(cs - as) is divisible by 11 and therefore 
abc(a5 - b5)(b5 - c5)(c5 - a5 ) is divisible by 11.

Since pis a prime and q is prime top, qP-1 -

Since q > 1, pq-l is divisible by p. 
Therefore pq- l + qP-l - I is divisible by p. 
Since q is a prime and pis prime to q, pq-l -
1 is divisible by q, by

Since p > I, qP-l is divisible by q. 
Therefore pq-l + qP-l - 1 is divisible by q.

Hence P;1 is even and therefore p = 4k + 1, where k is an integer. 
Therefore p is not of the form 4m - 1. If however, p be an even prime, 
then p is also not of the form 4m - 1. 
10. If p be a prime and a is prime top, prove that aP

aP -p 
(1 + tp)P

Consequently, the units digit in 3100 is 1. 
12. Show that 4(29)! + 5! is divisible by 31. 
By Wilson's theorem, (30)! + 1 = 0 (mod 31), since 31 is a prime.

or, -(29)! + 1 =-0 (mod 31) 
or, (29)! - 1 = 0 (mod 31) 
or, 4(29)! - 4 = O (mod 31) 
or, 4(29)! - 4 + 124 = O (mod 31) 
or. ·1(2U)! + 120 = 0 (1nod 31)

Then (a] = n1, [b] = n2, 0 < /1 + /2 < 2.

Let a= n + f, where n is an integer and O < J < 1. 
Then [a] = n. 0 < f < I => -1 < - f < O => O < 1 - f < l. 
-a= -n - f = -n - 1 + (1- /) and therefore [-a]= -n - 1.

Case 2. Let 1 < 2/ < 2. Then ½ < f < 1 and 1 < / + ½ < 1 + ½. 
Therefore [a+ ½] = (n + / + ½] = n + I and (2a] = [2n + 2/] = 2n + 1.

If p, 2p, 3p, ... , mp are all the positive integral multiples of p not ex-
ceeding n, then mp< n < (m + l)p. Therefore m < ~ < m + 1. This 
implies [ n] = m. This means that there are [ ~] integers < n that are 
divisible by p.

Another proof of Fermat's theorem. 
If p be a prime and pis not a divisor of n, nP-1 = 1 (mod p). 
Proof. First we prove that if p be a prime, nP = n ( mod p) for all positive 
integers n, by using the principle of induction. 
The statement nP = n ( mod p) is trivially true for n = 1. 
Let us assume that the statement is true for n = k, k > 1. 
Then kP = k (mod p). 
Now (k + l)P = kP +v c1kp- l +P c2kv-2 + · · · +P ep_1k + 1 
= kP + M(p) + 1, where M(p) =P c1kP-l +P c2kP-2 + · • • +v Cp-1k. 
M(p) is divisible by p, since Per is divisible by p for O < r < p. 
Therefore ( k + 1 )P = k + 1 ( mod p) and this shows that the statement 
nP = n (mod p) is true for n = k + 1, if it be true for n = k. By 
the principle of induction, the statement nP = n (mod p) is true for all 
natural numbers n. 
Case 1. n is a positive integer prime top. 
Cancelling n from both sides of the congruence nP _ n (mod p), we 
have nP-l = 1 (mod p). 
Case 2. n is a negative integer prime top. 
There exist integers q and r such that n = pq + r , where O < r < p. 
Then nP-1 = rP-1 (mod p), where r is a positive integer < p 
= 1 (mod p), by case 1. 
This completes the proof.

3. 7. Mobius function. 
Definition. The Mobius function µ is defined for all positive integers 
by 
µ(1) = 1; 
µ(n) = {-l)k if n = P1P2 .. ·Pk, where P1,P2, ... ,Pk are distinct 
prrmes; 
µ( n) = 0 if p2 In for some prime p. 
To be explicit, µ(n) = 0 if n is not square-free and µ(n) = (-l)k if n 
is square free and is the product of k distinct primes. 
For example, µ(1) = 1, µ(2) = -1, µ{3) = - 1, µ(4) = 0, µ(5) = -1, 
µ(6) = 1, µ(7) = -1, µ(8) = 0, µ(9) = 0, µ(10) = 1. 
Theorem 3. 7.1. The functionµ is a multiplicative function. That is, if 
m and n be relatively prime positive integers, then µ(mn) = µ(m)µ(n). 
Proof Case 1. Either m = 1 or n = 1. 
If m = 1, µ(mn) = µ(n) = µ(m)µ(n), since µ(m) = 1. 
If n = 1, µ(mn) = µ(m) = µ(m)µ(n), since µ(n) = 1. 
Case 2. Either m or n has a prime square divisor. 
In this case the integer mn has a prime square divisor. µ(mn) === o. 
If m has a prime square divisor, µ(m) = 0. Therefore µ(mn) === 
µ(m)µ(n) .

If n has a prime square divisor, µ(n) = 0. Therefore µ(mn)

each term is -1. 
In the group [µ(p1p2) + µ(p1p3) + · · · + µ(pk-IPk)], there are kc2 terms

3.8. Diophantine equation x 2 + y2 = z
2 
• 
A triplet of positive integers x, y, z satisfying the equa~ion x
2 + y2 ::: 
z 2 is called a Pythagorean triplet. x, y, z represent the si?es of a right 
triangle, z being the hypotenuse and x, y the legs of the tnangle. 
If x, y, z be a Pythagorean triplet, then kx, ky, kz is also a 
Pythagorean triplet for all integers k > 1 and they represent the sides of 
a similar triangle. 
A Pythagorean triplet x, y, z is called a primitive Pythagorean triplet 
if gcd(x, y, z) = 1. A primitive triplet corresponds to the smallest triangle 
with integer sides among all similar triangles. 
For example, 3, 4, 5; 6, 8, 10; 9, 12, 15; ... are all Pythagorean triplets 
representing similar right triangles, but 3, 4, 5 is the primitive triplet 
corresponding to this class of similar triangles. 
Some properties of primitive Pythagorean triplets. 
1. If x, y, z be a primitive triplet, then x, y, z are pairwise prime to each 
other. 
Proof gcd(x, y, z) = 1. Let gcd(x, y) = d > 1. Then dlx, dly. Let p be 
a prime divisor of d. Then plx,ply, This implies plx2 ,ply2 and therefore 
plz2 and this again implies plz, This contradicts that gcd(x, y, z) = 1. 
Therefore gcd(x, y) = 1. 
Similarly, gcd(y, z) = 1, gcd(x, z) = 1. 
2. If x, y, z be a primitive triplet, then z is odd and x , y are of different 
parity (i.e., one of them is odd and the other is even.) 
Proof Since gcd(x, y) = 1, x, y cannot be both even. 
Let x, y be both odd. Then x is either of the forms 4n + 1, 4n + 3. 
In any case, x2 is of the form 4n + 1. Similarly, y2 is of the form 4n + 1. 
So z 2 is of the form 4n + 2. Since for any integer, odd or even, a perfect 
square is either of the form 4n or of the form 4n + 1, z2 cannot be of the 
form 4n + 2. Therefore x, y cannot be both odd. 
Hence one of x, Y is odd and the other is even and therefore z is odd, 
To be definite, we shall take x odd, y even and of course z odd in a 
primitive Pythagorean triplet x, y, z. 
Theorem 3.8.1. The primitive Pythagorean triplets x, y, z are given by 
x = m 2 - n 2 , Y = 2mn, z = m2 + n2 , where m,n are positive integers 
prime to each other with m > n and m , n(mod 2). 
Since we have agreed to take y even, let y = 2k where k is a positi"e

and v == ~. u 
' v 
' z == u + v and x = u - v. 
gcd(x, z) = 1 => gcd\u, v) = l. Since u > 0, v > 0; gcd(u, v) = 1 and 
uv is a perfect squ~re, it follows that u is a perfect square and v is a 
perfect square. [This follows from canonical representations of u and v.] 
Let u = m

, v = n
2 where m, n are positive integers. gcd(u, v) = 1 => 
gcd( m, n) = 1. I~ m, n are both odd or both even, then u, v are both even 
and this contradicts gcd( u, v) = 1. Therefore one of m, n is odd and the 
other is even, i.e., m ¢ n(mod 2). 
Conversely, let the positive integers m, n with m > n be prime to each 
other and m ¢ n(mod 2). 
Then x = m 2 -
n
2
, y = 2mn, z = m2 + n2 form a Pythagorean 
triplet, since x
2 + y 2 = z 2 holds. We show that gcd(x, y, z) = 1. 
Let gcd( x, y, z) = d > 1. Let p be a prime divisor of d. Then 
pjx,pjy,pjz. pjx,plz => plm2,pln2 • This again implies pjm,pln, since 
pis a prime. This contradicts gcd(m, n) = 1. So gcd(x, y, z) = 1 and 
x, y, z form a primitive Pythagorean triplet. 
This completes the proof. 
Let us choose positive integers m = 2, 3, 4, 5 .. . and correspondingly 
positive integers n < m such that gcd( m, n) = 1 and m, n are of opposite

The triangle 1s given by x = 2r + 1, y = 2r(r + 1), z = 2r2 + 2r + l. 
There may be other triangles also. If there be an odd prime divisor p

- n2, Y = 2mn, z = m2 +n2 , where m, n are positive integers 
prime to each other with m > n and m, n are of different parity. 
Since one of m, n is even, y is a multiple of 4 and therefore 4jxy. 
If one of m, n is a multiple of 3, then y is a multiple of 3 and therefore 
3lxy. 
If none of m, n is a multiple of 3 then by Fermat's theorem, m 2 = 1 
(mod 3) and n2 = 1 (mod 3). Therefore m 2 - n2 = 0 (mod 3), i.e., 3lx 
and therefore 3 I xy. 
4lxy and 3jxy => 12lxy, since gcd(3, 4) = 1. 
2. If x, y, z be a primitive Pythagorean triplet, prove that 60jxyz. 
x = m 2 -n2 , y = 2mn, z = m2 +n2 , where m, n are positive integers 
prime to each other with m > n and m, n are of different parity. 
If one of m, n is a multiple of 5, then y is a multiple of 5 and therefore 
5lxyz. 
If none of m, n is a multiple of 5 then by Fermat's theorem, m 2 = 1 
(mod 5) and n2 = 1 (mod 5). Therefore m2 - n2 = 0 (mod 5), i.e., 5lx 
and therefore 5 I xy z. 
By Ex.1, l2jxyz. l2jxyz and 5jxyz => 60jxyz, since gcd(12, 5) = 1. 
3. If r be an odd prime, show that there are two Pythagorean triangles 
with in-radius r. 
The in-radius r of a Pythagorean triangle whose sides are x = m2 -
n2, y = 2mn, z = m 2 + n2, where m, n are positive integers of opposite 
Parity with m > n and gcd( m, n) = 1 is given by r = n( m - n), where 
m - n is odd and n is prime to m - n. 
There are two choices. We may take (i) m - n = I and n = r giving 
a triangle, (ii) m _ n =rand n = 1 giving a different triangle. 
Thus there are two Pythagorean triangles with in-radius r.

ao,a1,•••,an are called coefficients and a0xn,a1xx-1, ••• ,an are 
called terms of the polynomial. If ao i= 0, the polynomial is said to 
be of degree n and the term aoxn is called the leading term. 
The general form of a polynomial of degree 1 is a0x + a1, a0 i= O; and 
of degree 2 is aox2 + a1x + a2, ao i= 0. 
A non-zero constant a0 itself is said to be a polynomial of degree 0 
while a polynomial all of whose coefficients are zero is said to be a zero 
polynomial and is denoted by 0 and no degree is assigned to it. 
Since a polynonial is an expression containing the variable x, it is 
denoted by f(x),g(x) etc. The value of the polynomial f(x) for x = a 
where a is a real number or a complex number is denoted by / (a). 
In particular, if the coefficients ao, a1, a2, ... of a polynomial f(x) be

Theorem 4.1.1. Division algorithm. 
Let f ( x) and g( x) be two polynomials of degree n and m respectively 
and n > m. Then there exist two uniquely determined polynomials q(x) 
and r(x) satisfying 
f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x), 
where the degree of q(x) is n-m and r(x) is either a zero polynomial or 
the degree of r(x) is less than m. 
Proof. Let f(x) = aoxn + a1xn-l +· ··+an, 
g(x) = boxm + b1xm-l + · · · + bm, 
Let us consider the polynomial 
ao # 0

f1(x) = f(x) - txn-mg(x) = f(x) - eoxn-mg(x), where Co= i!· 
Either /1 ( x) is a zero polynomial, or else the degree of / 1 ( x) is n1 < n. 
Now f(x) = eoxn-mg(x) + f1(x). Two cases arise. 
Case I. /1(x) is either a zero polynomial, or the degree of / 1(x) < m. In 
this case 
f (x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x), where q(x) = c0xn-m, r(x) = /1 (x) and the 
theorem is proved. 
Case II. n1 > m. 
In this case_/1(x) = PoXn1 + · · · + Pn·

Let /2(x) = /1(x) - fxni-mg(x)

Either f2(x) is a zero polynomial, or else the degre!

Now f1(x) = c1xni-mg(x) + /2(x). Two cases arise. 
Case I. /2(x) is either a zero polynomial, or the degree of J2(x) is 1~ 
than m. In this case 
J(x) can be expressed~ [eoxn-m + c1xni-m]g(x) + J2(x) 
= q(x)g(x) + r(x), provmg the theorem.

fi(x) 
cixni-mg(x) + f2(x), 
/k(x) = CkXn1c-mg(x) + fk+l (x). 
Therefore f(x) = (eoxn-m+c1xni-m+ .. ·+ckxn1c-m)g(x)+fk+l(x) 
= q(x)g(x) + r(x), where q(x) = eoxn-m + c1xn1-m+ 
... + CkXn1c-m and r(x) = f n+l (x ). 
We now prove the uniqueness of q(x) and r(x). 
If possible, let there be two other polynomials q1 ( x) and r 1 ( x) such 
that J(x) = q1(x)g(x) + r1(x), where the degree of q1(x) is n - m and 
r1(x) is either a zero polynomial, or else the degree of r 1(x) is less than 
m. 
Then O = {q(x) - q1(x)}g(x) + {r(x) - r 1(x)} 
or, r1(x) - r(x) = {q(x) - q1(x)}g(x) 
(A) 
By the property of r( x) and r 1 ( x), the left hand side polynomial 
r1 ( x) - r ( x) is either a zero polynomial or else the degree of r 1 ( x) - r( x) 
is less than that of g( x). But the second possibility is ruled out because 
the equality (A) demands that the degree of r1(x) - r(x) is greater than 
that of g(x ). 
Therefore r1(x) - r(x) and consequently q(x) - q1(x) are zero poly-
nomials and this proves uniqueness of q(x) and r(x). 
g(x) is said to be the divisor, q(x) is said to be the quotient and r(x) 
is said to be the remainder. 
H r(x) be a zero polynomial, J(x) is said to be divisible by g(x). In 
this case g(x) is said to be a factor of /(x).

Therefore /(x) = (x - a)q(x) + R. 
Hence /(a) = O.q(o:) + R. That is, /(o:} = R. 
Corollary. /(x) can be expressed as f(x) = (x - o:)q(x) + /(o:). 
Definition. If /(x) is a polynomial and /(o:) = 0 then o: is said to he 
a zero of the polynomial / ( x). 
Theorem 4.1.3. Factor theorem. 
If J ( x) be a polynomial then x - a: is a factor of f ( x) if and only if 
/(o.) = 0. 
Proof. Let x - a be a factor of f(x). Then f(x) = (x - o:).g(x) for some 
polynomial g(x). Therefore /(a) = (a - o:).g(o:) = 0. 
Conversely, let f ( o:) = O. Let R be the remainder and q( x) be the quotient 
when / (x) is divided by x - a. 
Then /(x) = (x - a)q(x) + R. But R = J(a) = 0. 
Therefore f(x) = (x - a)q(x), showing that x - a: is a factor of f(x). 
Worked Examples. 
1. Prove that x 2 + x + 1 is a factor of x10 + x 5 + 1. 
We have x2 + x + 1 = (x - w)(x -w2 ), where w is an imaginary cube 
root of 1. 
Let f(x) = x10 +x5 + 1. Then f(w) = w10 +w5 + 1 = w +w2 +1 =0. 
f(w2)-= w20 +w10 + 1 = w2 +w + 1 = 0. 
Therefore (x - w)(x - w2), i.e., x2 + x + 1 is a factor of J(x). 
2. Find the remainder when 4x5 + 3x3 + 6x2 + 5 is divided by 2x + 1. 
Let f ( x) = 4x5 + 3x3 + 6x2 + 5. Let q( x) be the quotient and R be 
the remainder when f ( x) ~s divided by 2x + 1. 
Then f(x) = (2x + l)q(x) +Rand therefore/(-½)= O.q(-½) +R. 
The remainder R = /(-½) = 4. ai + 3. 8

4 +4x2 +x+4. Let q(x) be the quotient and rx+s 
be the remainder when f(x) is divided by (x + l)(x _ 2). 
Then /(x) = (x + l)(x - 2)q(x) + (rx + s). 
Hence /(-1) = 0.q(-1) + (-r + s) and /(2) = 0.q(2) + (2r + s). 
But /(-1) = 3 and /(2) = 6.

Consequently, -r + 8 = 3 and 2r + s = 6. Therefore r = 1, s = 4 and 
the remainder is x + 4. 
4. For what integral values of m, x 2 + x + 1 is a factor x2m + xm + 1? 
x2 +x + 1 = (x -w)(x -w2), where w is an imaginary cube root of 1. 
Let J(x) = x 2m + xm + 1. Then 
f(w) = w2m + wm + 1, /(w2) = w4m +w2m + 1. 
x2 + x + 1 is a factor of x 2m + xm + 1 if f(w) = 0 and f(w2 ) = 0. 
The int~ger m is one of the forms 3k, 3k + I, 3k + 2 where k is an 
integer. 
When m = 3k, f(w) = 1 + 1 +I= 3 and f(w2 ) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 
When m = 3k+ I, J(w) = w2 +w+ I= 0 and f(w) = w2 +w+ 1 = 0. 
When m = 3k+2, f(w) = w+w2+I = 0 and /(w2) = w2+w+I = 0. 
Therefore if m be not an integral multiple of 3, x2 + x + I is a factor 
of x2m + xm + 1. 
4.2. Synthetic division. 
We have seen that when a polynomial / ( x) is divided by x - a the 
remainder can be obtained readily without going into laborious process 
of division algorithm. 
We now develop a simple method of obtaining the quotient when f (x) 
is divided by x - a. 
Let the quotient be b0xn-I + b1xn-2 + · · · + bn-I and the remainder 
beR. 
Then aoxn + a1xn-l +···+an = (boxn-l + b1xn-2 + · · · + bn-1)(x -
a)+ R. Equating coefficients of like powers of x, we have 
ao = bo 
a1 = b1 - ab0 
a2 = ~ - ab1 
... 
an-I = bn-1 - abn-2 
an= R- abn-I• 
Therefore bo, b1, ... , bn-l and R are given by 
bo = ao, b1 = a1 + abo, b2 = a2 + ab1, ... , bn-1 = On-1 + o:bn-2, R = 
On+ abn-l• 
t 
The calculation for bo, bi, ... , bn-l and R can be performed in the 
tollowing scheme.

The coefficients of the polynomial / ( x) are v:ritten in. the first line; if 
any term be absent the zero coefficient should be included 1n the sequence. 
The third line begins with bo ( = ao). 
b0 is multiplied by a and is written below a1 , the sum 01 + ab0 gives 
b1 . b1 is multiplied by a and written below a2, the sum a2 + ab1 gives 
b2, ... 
The process continues till at the last step bn-1 is multiplied by a and 
is written below an, the sum an+ abn-1 gives the remainder R. 
The method described in the scheme is called the method of synthetic 
division. The method gives a ready calculation for the remainder J(o:). 
We shall see later that the method also determines quickly the values 
of the derivatives of successive orders of f(x) at x = a, i.e., the values of 
f'(a), f"(a), ... , fn(a) .

Let f(x) be expressed as Ao(x - a)n + A1(x - a)n-l +.• •+An· 
Therefore f(x) = (x-a)[Ao(x-a)n-l+A1(x-a)n- 2+-. •+An-1]+An 
This shows that if f(x) is divided by x - a, the quotient q1(x) is 
Ao(x - a)n-l + A1 (x - a)n-2 + · · · + An-l and the remainder is An·

This shows that if q1(x) is divided by x - a, the quotient q2(x) is 
Ao(x - a)n-2 + A1(x - a)n-3 + · · · + An_2 and the remainder is An-I· 
The process can be continued n times and the remainders are succes-

Definition. a is said to be a zero of order r of the polynomial f(x) if 
(x - at is a factor of f(x) while (x - af+1 is not a factor of f(x). 
Theorem 4.3.1. a is a zero of order r of the polynomial /(x) if and 
only if /(a) =/'(a)=···= 1r-1(a) = 0, and /r(a) :f= 0. 
Proof. Let a be a zero order r. Then (x - of is a factor of f(x) but 
(x - ay+1 is not. Let f (x) = (x - at </>(x) where </>(a) :f= O. Because 
</>(a) = 0 implies that x-a is a factor of </>(x) and consequently (x-af+1 
is a factor of f ( x), a contradiction.

and 1/,(a) = r</>(a) # 0. 
Therefore /'(a)= 0. 
f"(x) = (x - aY-2[(x - a)1J,'(x) + (r - 1)1/J(x)] 
= (x - af-2"Y(x), where "Y(x) = (x - a)'l/J'(x) + (r - 1)1/J(x) and 
"Y(a) =I= 0. 
Therefore /"(a)= 0 .

5.1. Algebraic equations. 
Let f(x) be a polynomial in x of degree > 1 whose co-efficients are 
real or complex numbers. 
Then / ( x) = 0 is said to be an algebraic equation or a polynomial 
equation. The degree of the polynomial f ( x) is said to be the degree of 
the equation f ( x) = 0. 
An equation of degree 1 is a0x + a1 = 0, where ao =/- 0. 
An equation of degree 2 is a0x2 + a1x + a2 = 0, where ao =/- 0. This 
is said to be a quadratic equation. 
An equation of degree 3 is a0x 3 + a 1 x 2 + a2x + a3 = 0, where ao =/- 0. 
This is said to be a cubic equation. 
An equation of degree 4 is a0x4 + a1x 3 + a2x2 + aax + a 4 = 0, where 
ao-::/= 0. This is said to be a biquadratic equation. 
The general "form of an algebraic equation of degree n is a0xn + 
a1xn-l + · • • +an-ix+ an = 0, where ao, a1, ... , an are real or com-
plex numbers and a0 =/- 0. 
If a be a value of x for which f(x) becomes zero, i.e., if /(o.) = 0, 
then o: is said to be a root of the equation f ( x) = 0. 
The existence of such an o. for which f(x) becomes zero is assured by 
a theorem, called the Fundamental theorem of classical algebra, 
which states that 
every algebraic equation has a root, real or complex. 
Here we take the theorem without proof and derive some important 
deductions from it. 
Theorem 5.1.1. An algebraic equation of degree n has n roots and no 
more. 
Proof. Let f (x) = a0xn + a 1xn-l + · · · + an be a polynomial with co-
efli · 
cients real or complex, of degree n. 'Then ao =I= 0. 
The equation f ( x) = O is an algebraic equation of degree n. 
By the fundamental theorem, this equation has a root, say o 1.

By the fundamental t eorem, t e equation

J1(x) = 0 has a root, say 0:2,

Then f ( o:2) = o and by the factor theorem, x -
a2 1s a factor of the 
polynomial /1 (x). 
Let J1(x) = (x-o:2)J2(x) where J2(x) is a polynomial of degree n-2 
with leading co-efficient ao. 
. 
If n > 2, we continue with the same reasomng and come to some 
polynomial fn-1(x) = ao(x - O:n). 
Therefore f(x) -
(x - o:1)/1(x) 
-
(x - o:1)(x - o:2)/2(x) 
(x - o:1)(x - 0:2) ... (x - O:n-1)fn-1(x) 
ao(x - o:1)(x - 0:2) ... (x - On-1)(x - O:n), 
This shows that f ( x) is expressed as the product of n linear factors, 
each factor corresponds to a root and this proves that 0:1, 0:2, ••• , On are 
n roots of the equation f ( x) = 0. 
Now we shall prove that there cannot be more than n roots. H pos-
sible, let /3 be a root of the equation f(x) = 0, where /3 is different 
from a1, 0:2, ... , an. Since /3 is a root, f(/3) = 0 and this would imply 
ao(/3 - 0:1)(/3 - 0:2) ... (/3 - o:n) = 0. 
This is impossible because a0 # 0 and f3 - o:i # O for i = 1, 2, .. •, n. 
Therefore f ( x) = 0 cannot have more than n roots. 
This completes the proof. 
Theorem 5.1.2. If two polynomials f(x) and g(x), both of degree n 
take equal values for more than n distinct values of x then f ( x) and 
g( x) are identical polynomials. 
' 
Proof. Let f(x) = g(x) for x = o:1, o:2, ... , am where m > n. 
Then f(o:1) = 9(0:1), f{o:2) = 9(0:2), ... , f(o:m) = 9(0:m)· 
Let </J( x) = f ( x) - 9( x) • Then </J( x) is either a zero polynomial or 8 
polynomial of degree < n. 
In_ the c~ of the second possibility, </>(x) = o happens to be all 
equation having m r~ot~ o:1, o:2, ... , o:m, since </>{o:i) = o, 4>(a2) :::: 
O, · · ·, </>(o:m) = 0. Again since m > n, the degree of the equation </>(x):::: O 
cannot be nor less than n, i.e., the degree of the polynomial <f,(x) cannot 
be < n, a contradiction. 

THEORY OF EQUATIONS 
197 
Therefore <f,(x) is a zero polynomial and this proves /(x) and g(x) are 
identical polynomials. 
This completes the proof. 
Definition. If / ( x) be a zero polynomial then / ( x) = 0 is said to be an 
identity. In other words, if /(x) and g(x) be two identical polynomials 
then J(x) = g(x) is said to be an identity. 
Examples. 
1. (a - b}[(a + b)x2 + x + 1] + (b - c)[(b + c)x2 + x + 1) + (c - a)[(c + 
a)x2 + x + 1] = 0 is an identity, because the left hand side polynomial is 
3 zero polynomial. 
2. a(x2+bx+l}+b(x2+cx+l)+c(x2+ax+l) = a(x2+cx+l)+b(x2+ 
ax + 1) + c( x2 + bx + 1) is an identity, because the equality is satisfied 
by x = a, x = b, x = c. 
We have seen that if / ( x) = 0 is a polynomial equation of degree n 
then the equation has n roots, say 01, 02, ... , an. In this case f(x) can 
be expressed as the product of n linear factors ao(x-a1)(x-a2) ... (x-
an), ao being the leading co-efficient of the polynomial f(x). The factors 
need not be all distinct. If may be that a1 = 02 = . . . = O'.r. In this 
case (x - a 1)r is a factor of f(x) and a 1 is said to be a multiple root of 
order r. There may be many multiple roots of /(x) = 0. If however, each 
root is counted according to its multiplicity, the number of roots of the 
equation f(x) = 0 is exactly n. 
If a be a root of the polynomial equation / ( x) = 0 of multiplicity r, 
then (x - at is a factor of f(x). 
Then /(x) = (x-at</>(x), where <f,(x) is a polynomial of degree n-r 
and </>(a) -I 0, because </>(a)= 0 would imply x-a is a factor of </>(x) and 
as such (x-a)r+l would be a factor of f(x) contradicting the multiplicity 
of a. 
Theorem 5.1.3. If a be a multiple root of the polynomial equation 
f(x) == 0 of order r, then a is a multiple root of the equation /'(x) = 0 
of order r - 1. 
· 
Proof. Let f(x) = O be an equation of degree n. Since a is a multiple 
root of order r, r < n. J(x) can be expressed as f(x) = (x - at </>(x), 
Where </>(x) is a polynomial of degree n - r and </>(a) 'I= 0.

To determine the multiple roots of an equation f(x) = 0, we find out 
the h.c.f. of the polynomials f ( x) and /' ( x). The zeroes of the h.c.f.

Theorem 5.2.1. Han equation with real coefficients has a complex root 
a + i/3 then it has also the conjugate complex root a _ i/3. 
In other words, in an equation with real coefficients imaginary roots 
occur in conjugate pairs. 
proof. Let f ( x) = 0 be an equation of degree n with real coefficients and 
let a + i/3 be a root of / ( x) = 0. It is obvious that n > 2. 
Let us divide f(x) by the product {x - (a+ if3)}{x - (a - i/3)}, i.e., 
by (x - a)2 + /32 - Let q(x) be the quotient and r(x) be the remainder. 
Then the degree of q(x) is n - 2 and the degree of r(x) is at most one. 
Since f(x) is a real polynomial and (x - a)2 + {32 is also a real 
quadratic, q(x) and r(x) are both real polynomials and we assume 
r(x) =ax+ b where a and bare both real. 
Therefore f(x) = [(x - a)2 + /32]q(x) +ax+ b. 
Since a+ i/3 is a root, f(a + i/3) = 0, i.e., a(a + i/3) + b = 0 
or, ( an + beta) + ia/3 = 0 and this implies aa + b = 0, a/3 = 0. 
But /3 I 0. Therefore a= 0 and consequently, b = 0. 
So f(x) = [(x - a)2 + f32]q(x). 
J(o: - i/3) = [(a - i/3 - a)2 + f32]q(a - i/3) = 0 and this proves that 
a - i/3 is a root of the equation f(x) = 0. 
This completes the proof. 
Note. If a+i/3 be a multiple complex root of f(x) = 0 whose coefficients 
are all real, of multiplicity r then a - i/3 is also a multiple root of the 
equation f(x) = 0 of multiplicity r. 
From the theorem it follows that imaginary roots of a polynomial 
I 
equation with real coefficients occur always in pairs. Therefore in such 
an equation the number of imaginary roots is always even. 
If the degree of a polynomial equation with real coefficients be odd 
then it follows that the equation has at least a real root. If however, the 
degree be even then the equation may not have a real root at all. 
If f ( x) be a polynomial with real coefficients, to each linear factor x -
<l-i{3 of f(x) corresponding to an imaginary root a+i/3 there corresponds 
another linear factor x - a+i/3 corresponding to the conjugate root a-i/3 
and the product (x-a-if3)(x-a+if3) = (x-a)2+,82 is a real quadratic 
factor of J(x). 
Therefore we can say that a real polynomial can always be expressed 
as the Product of real linear and real quadratic factors.

Let f(x) = x4 + x2 - 2x + 6. 
. 
Since f ( x) = o is an equation with real coefficients and 1 + i is a root 
of the equation, 1 - i is also a root. 
Therefore (x -1- i)(x -1 + i) = x2 - 2x + 2 is a factor of J(x). 
Let f(x) = (x2 - 2x + 2)q(x). 
Then q(x) = x2 + 2x + 3.

These giver= 1, cos 8 + cos <I>= ½, 2 cos 8 cos <I>= 0. 
Therefore either cos 8 = 0

Taking cos 8 = 0, we have cos </> = ½, sin </> = ~' sin 8 = 1. 
Taking cos </> = 0, we have cos 8 = ½, sin 8 = ~, sin </> = 1.

Theorem 5.2.2. If an equation with rational coefficients has a surd root 
a+./P, where a, ,Bare rational and ,Bis not a perfect square, then it has 
also the conjugate surd root a - -,JP. 
In other words, in an equation with rational coefficients surd roots 
occur in conjugate pairs. 
Proof. Let f ( x) = 0 be an equation of degree n with rational coefficients 
and let a+ v17J be a root of J(x) = 0. It is obvious that n > 2. 
Let us divide / ( x) by the product ( x - a - ..JP) ( x - a + ..JP) i.e., by 
(x- a)2 - ,B. Let q(x) be the quotient and r(x) be the remainder. Then 
the degree of q(x) is n - 2 and the degree of r(x) is at most one. 
Since f ( x) is a polynomial with rational coefficient and ( x - a) 2 - ,B is 
a quadratic with rational coefficients, q(x) and r(x) are both polynomials 
with rational coefficients. We assume r( x) = ax + b, where a and b are 
both rational. 
Therefore f(x) = [(x - a)2 - ,B]q(x) +ax+ b. 
Since a+ v17J is a root, /(a+ ./P) = 0. 
Therefore a(a +.JP)+ b = 0, or, (aa + b) + a'\/P = 0. 
But ,B ¥= 0. 
Therefore a= 0, b = 0 and J(x) = [(x - a)2 - ,B]q(x). 
f(o:- '1P) = [(a - .JP- a)2 - ,B]q(a -v'P) = 0 and this proves that 
0 -v"P is a root. 
This completes the proof. 
~ote. In an equation with rational coefficients, the number of surd roots

o and /3. 
Proof. For the purpose of this theorem we assume x is a real variable. 
Since f ( x) is a polynomial, the function f is continuous for all real i. 
Since f(a) and J(/3) are of opposite signs, it follows from the pr-0pertyof 
a real continuous function that there is at least a real number , between 
o and /3 such that J( 1') = 0. 
That is, the equation f ( x) = 0 has a real root 1 lying between o: and P.

f ( x) = 0 has no real root and conversely.

Therefore there is at least one real root lying between -3 and -1. 
The equation has exactly three roots. One root is positive, one root

If 1 + ,\ > o then /(-oo) and /(oo) are both positive. 
In this case each of the intervals (-oo, 2), (2, 4), (4, 6), (6, 8) contains 
at least one real root of f ( x) = O. So the roots are all real and_ simple. 
If 1 + ,\ < O then / (-oo) and / ( oo) are both negative. 
In this case each of the intervals (2, 4), (4, 6), (6, 8), (8, oo) contains at

H 1 + ,\ = O, /(x) = 0 is a cubic equation. In this case each of the

Theorem 5.2.5. Rolle's theorem. 
Let f(x) be a polynomial .with real coefficients. Between two consec-
utive real roots of the equation / ( x) = 0 there is at least one real root of 
the equation /' ( x) = 0. 
Proof. Let o., /3 be two consecutive real roots of the equation f(x) = 0 
with multiplicity rands respectively. Then (x - a.Y (x - {3) 3 is a factor 
of the polynomial / ( x). 
Let f(x) = (x - a.Y(x_- f3)
11<1>(x). 
Then </>(o.) # 0 and </>(/3) # 0, because otherwise the ~umed multi-
plicity of o., /3 would be contradicted. Also </>(o.) and </>(/3) have the same 
sign, because otherwise </>( x) = 0 would have a real root between a and 
/3 and consequently f ( x) = 0 would have a real root between a and P, 
which is a contradiction. 
f'(x) 
r(x - ay-1(x - {3) 11</>(x) + (x - o.)r 
(x - /3)"-1</>(x) + (x - o.Y(x - /3) 8 </>'(x) 
(x - o.y-1(x - /3)"- 11/J(x), where 
1/J(x) = r(x - /3)</>(x) + s(x - a.)</>(x) + (x - a.)x - {3)</>'(x). 
Therefore 1/J(o.) = r(o. - /3)</>(o.), 1/J(/3) = s(/3 - a)</>(/3). 
Since </>(o.) and </>(/3) are of the same sign, 1/J(o) and 'f/1(/3) are of dif-
ferent signs and this shows that the equation 1/J( x) = o and consequently 
the equation /'(x) = 0 has at least one real root between a and f3. 
This completes the proof.

'(x) ::::: o there IS e1 er no re 
root or at most one real root of the 
~uation J(x) = 0 and such a root must be simple. 
Because if there exist two real roots of the equation /(x) = o, say a,{3

111£ the equation /' ( x) = 0 in between a and /3 and this would contradict

t· 
that a', {3' are consecu 1ve. 
Therefore the number of real roots of / ( x) = 0 lying between a' and 
P' is at most one. Such a root of / ( x) = 0 must be simple because a 
multiple root of the equation / ( x) . 0 must also be a root of /' ( x) = 0. 
If ).' be the least and µ' be the greatest real root of the equation 
f'(x) = O, each of the intervals (-oo, ,\'), (µ', oo) will contain either no 
real root or at most one real root of the equation /(x) = 0. 
It is evident that the interval (a', /3') will contain no real root of the 
equation /(x) = 0 if /(a')/(/3') > 0 and will contain just one real root 
of the equation /(x) = 0 if /(a')/(/3') < 0. 
2. If all the roots of the equation / ( x) = 0 be real and distinct, then all 
the roots of /'(x) = 0 are also so. Any two consecutive roots of /'(x) = 0 
are separated by a root of /(x) = 0. 
Let the real roots of f(x) = 0 be 01, 02, ... , On where 01 < 02 < 
... < On. There are n-1 intervals (01, 02), (02, 03), ... , (on-1, on) each 
containing a real root of /' ( x) = 0, by the theorem. Since the degree of 
f'(x) is n - 1, these n - 1 real roots are all the roots of f'(x) = 0. 
Theorem 5.2.6. Let f(x) be a polynomial with real coefficients. H 
the equation / ( x) = O has r real roots, the number of real root of the 
equation f'(x) = 0 is at least r - 1. 
Proof. Let a 1, a 2, .•• , a 8 be the distinct real roots of /(x) = ·o with 
respective multiplicities m 1, m 2 , ... , ma. Then m1 + m2 + · · · + ms = r. 
Let us assume a 1 < a 2 < . . . < Os. 
Each of the s - 1 intervals (01, 02), (02, 03), ... , (as-1, as) contains 
at least one real root of /' ( x) = O, by Rolle's theorem. Therefore we have 
not less than s - 1 distinct real roots of /' ( x) = O. 
Moreover, 
a 1 is a root of /' ( x) = 0 
02 is a root of /'(x) = 0 
of multiplicity m1 - 1; 
of multiplicity m2 - 1; 
a 8 is a root of /' ( x) = 0 
of multiplicity m., - 1. 
Therefore the total number of these real roots becomes

(m1 - 1) + (m2 - 1) +···+(ms - l) + 8 - 1

Therefore the equation /' ( x) = 0 will have at least r - 1 real roots. 
This completes the proof. 
Corollary. If all the roots of the equation f ( x) = 0 be real, then the 
equation /'(x) = O cannot have an imaginary root. 
Worked Examples (continued). 
8. Show that the equation (x - a)3 + (x - b)3 + (x - c)3 + (x - d)3 == o 
where a, b, c, d are positive and not all equal, has only one real root. 
Let f ( x) = ( x - a )3 + ( x - b )3 + ( x - c )3 + ( x - d)
3
• 
Since the equation is of degree 3 it has either only one real root or 
three real roots. Let us assume that the equation has more than one real 
roots. Let a, {3 be two such. Then f' ( x) = 0 has a real root between a 
and {3. 
f'(x) = 3(x - a)2 + 3(x - b)2 + 3(x - c)2 + 3(x - d)2 
= 12x2 - 6(a + b + c + d)x + 3(a2 + b2 + c2 + d2). 
The discriminant of the equation f' ( x) = 0 is 
36(a + b + c + d)2 -144(a2 + b2 + c2 + d2). 
Since a, b, c, d are all positive and not all equal 
a2+b2!c2+d2 > ( a+b1c+d)2 
or, 4(a2 + b2 + c2 + d2) > (a+ b + c + d)2 . 
Therefore the discriminant of the equation f' ( x) = O is negative and 
so f'(x) = 0 has no real root. 
This proves that the equation f ( x) = O has only one real root. 
9. Find the values of k for which the equation x 4 +4x3 -2x2 - l2x+k == 0 
has four real and unequal roots. 
Let f(x) = x4 + 4x3 - 2x2 -12x + k. 
Then f'(x) = 4x3 + 12x2 - 4x - 12 
= 4(x - l)(x + 3)(x + 1). 
The roots off' (x) = 0 are -3, -1, 1. 
Since the roots of the equation f ( x) = o are to be all real and distinct 
they will be separated by the roots of the equation f' ( x) = O. 
Therefore one root is less than -3, one root lies between -3 and -l, 
one root lies between -1 and 1 and one root is greater than 1.

Let f(x) = aoxn + a1xn-l + • • • + an, where

(i) pis a divisor of an and q is a divisor of a0 , 
(ii) 
p - q is a divisor of /(1) and p + q is a divisor of /(-1). 
Proof. (i) Since p/q is a root of the equation f(x) = 0, 
aopn + a1pn-lq + ... + an-1Pqn-l + anqn = 0 
or, aopn-1 + a1pn-2q + ... + an-lqn-1 = - anqn. 
p 
The left hand expression is an integer and therefore p is divisor of 
anqn. Since p and q are prime to each other, pis a divisor of an, 
Again, - aopn = a1pn-l + .. • an-lPqn-2 + anqn-I _ 
q 
The right hand expression is an integer and therefore q is divisor of 
aopn. Since p and q are prime to each other, q is a divisor of ao. 
(ii) 
f(x + 1) 
. ao(x + l)n + a1(x + l)n-l +···+an 
= Aoxn + A1xn-l + · · · + An, say 
where Ao= ao, An= /(1).

Therefore 'E:::!l. is a root of the equation Aoxn + A1 xn-l + · · ·+An = 0. 
P - q and q ~re prime to each other, since p is prime to q. 
By (i) p - q is a divisor of An, i.e., p - q is a divisor of /(1). 
Proceeding similarly with J ( x - 1), it can be established that p + q is 
; d_ivisor of J ( -1).

his completes the proof.

Let f(x) = x4 + x3 - 2x2 + 4x - 24. Then /(1) = -20, /(-1):::: -JO. 
Let p be an integer root of the equation. Then p is a divisor of _ 24. 
The divisors of -24 are ±1, ±2, ::l:3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12,±24. 
Since /(1) =I= O and /(-1) =/= 0, it follows that p =/ 1,-1. 
p - 1 is a divisor of -20. Therefore p =I= -2, 4, -6, 8, -8, 12, -12,24, _24. 
p + 1 is a divisor of -30. Therefore p =I= 3, 6. 
Thus the only possible values of p are 2, -3, -4. 
/(2) = O, /(-3) = 0 and /(-4) =I= 0. Therefore 2 and -3 are integer 
roots. (x-2)(x+3) is a factor of f(x) and/(x) = (x-2)(x+3)(x2+4). 
Therefore the roots of .the equation are 2, -3, ±2i.

u is said to be an upper limit and l is said to be a lower limit of the

Let the equation f ( x) = 0 be written with the coefficient of the leading

A real number u is an upper limit of the real roots of the equation

A real number l is a lower limit of the real roots of the equation 
J(x) = 0 if it is an upper limit of the equation f(-x) = O. 
A real number h is said to be a lower limit of the positive roots of

1. Let f ( x) = x4 + 2x2 - x - 1. 
Then / ( x) > 0 if x > 1. Therefore 1 is an upper limit of the real 
roots. 
J(-x) = x 4 + 2x2 + x -1. 
1 is an upper limit of the real roots of f(-x) = 0. Therefore -1 is a

!(¾) = 0 gives x 4 + x 3 - 2x2 - 1 = 0. 
2 is an upper limit of the positive roots of the equation /(¼) = 0. 
Therefore ½ is a lower limit of the positive roots of f(x) = 0. 
2. Let / ( x) = x5 - 4x3 + x 2 - x + 1. 
Then / (x) > O if x > 2. Therefore 2 is an upper limit of the real roots 
of the equation f(x) = O. 
f(-x) = 0 gives xs - 4x3 - x2 - x -1 = 0. 
. 
3 is an upper limit of the roots of f(-x) = 0. Therefore -3 1s a lower

f ( 1) = 0 gives xs - x4 + x3 - 4x2 + 1 = O.

Since /(a) > 0, /'(a) > 0, . . . , /n(a} > 0, no positive value of y can 
make f(y +a)= 0. 
Therefore f ( x) = 0 has no root greater than a. In other words, a is 
an upper limit of the positive roots of the equation f(x) = 0.

Practical application. 
While searching for an upper limit of the real roots, the theor~ 
discussed here can be applied to an equation. There is no general r e 
about the suitability or superiority of one particular method over an°ther, 
Sometimes one of them gives a closer limit, sometime another. 
IJlS 
Sometimes a better approximation is achieved by grouping th~ teracb 
of the equation in a suitable manner so that the sum of the te~~ 1:; the 
group > 0 for x > h. Then obviously h becomes an upper bnut 
real roots.

s. Find an upper linut of the real roots of the equation x4 _ 2x3 + ax2 _ 
2X + 2 == o. 
Let f(x) = x4 - 2x3 + 3x2 - 2x + 2. 
The equation can be arranged as x 3(x - 2) + 3x(x - }) + 2 = o. 
J(x) > 0 for x > 2. Therefore 2 is an upper limit of the real roots. 
By the theorem 5.3.2, 2 + 1 is an upper limit. 
Let us apply the theorem 5.3.3. 
f'(x) = 4x3 - 6x2 + 6x - 2 = 2(2x3 - 3x2 + 3x - 1), 
f"(x) = 12x2 -12x + 6 = 6(2x2 - 2x + 1), 
/"'(x) = 24x - 12 = 12{2x - 1). 
/"'(1) > 0,/"(1) > 0,/'(1) > 0,/(1) > o. 
Therfore 1 is an upper limit of the real roots. 
Note. The theorem 5.3.3 gives the closest limit. 
4. Find an upper limit of the real roots of the equation x4 - x3 - 2x2 -
4x+ 1 = 0. 
Multiplying the equation by 3 the equation can be arranged as 
(x4 - 3x3) + (x4 - 6x2) + (x4 - 12x) + 3 = 0 
or, x3(x - 3) + x 2(x2 - 6) + x(x3 - 12) + 3 = 0. 
Each group > 0 for x > 3. Therefore 3 is an upper limit of the roots 
of the equation. 
By the theorem 5.3.2, 4 + 1 is an upper limit. 
Let us apply the theorem 5.3.3. 
Let f ( x) 
x4 - x3 - 2x2 - 4x + 1. 
Then f'(x) 
4x3 - 3x2 - 4x - 4, 
f"(x) = 12x2 - 6x - 4 = 2(6x2 - 3x - 2), 
f"'(x) = 24x - 6 = 6(4x - 1). 
f(x) > o for x > 3, f'(x) > o for x > 2, f"(x) > 0 for x > 1,/"'(x) > 0 
for X > 1. 
Hence 3 is an upper limit.

By the theorem 5.3.2, 3 + 1 is an upper hmit.

Let us apply the theorem 5.3.3.

Then f'(x)

f"(x) = 12x2 - 18x - 4 = 2(6x2 - 9x - 2), 
f"'(x) = 24x - 18 = 6(4x - 3). 
f(x) > 0 for x > 3, f'(x) > 0 for x > 3, f"(x) > 0 for x ~ 2, 
f"'(x) > 0 for x > 1. 
Hence 3 is an upper limit. 
5.3.4. Descartes' rule of signs. 
· In a sequence of real numbers ao, a1, ... , an, none of which is zero, 
the signs of two consecutive elements may be same or different. When 
same sign occurs we say that the elements show a continuation of signs; 
when the signs are different we say that the elements show a variation of 
signs. 
For example, in the sequence 1, 3, -5, -7, 9, -4, 10, 2 there are 3 con-
tinuations and 4 variations of signs. 
If some of the elements of a sequence be zero, we ignore their presence 
in the sequence and count the number of continuations and variations of 
signs. 
For example, in the sequence 1, 3, -2, 0, -3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7 there are 3 
continuations and 2 variations of signs. 
We state here without proof a celebrated theorem of Descartes, 
known as "Descartes' rule of signs". 
Statement of the rule. 
The number of positive roots of an equation f ( x) = O with real coeffi· 
cients does not exceed the number of variations of signs in the sequence 
of the coefficients of f(x) and if less, it is less by an even number. 
This says that if v be the number of variations of signs and r be the 
number of positive roots, then v = r + 2h where h is a non-negative 
integer. 
Deductions. 
1. The number of negative roots of an equation J ( x) = O with real coef-
ficients does not exceed the number of variations of signs in the sequence 
of coefficients of f(-x) and if less, it is less by an even number. 
Proof. Let r' be the number of negative roots of the equation f(x)::::: o. 

THEORY OF EQUATIONS 
215 
Then r' is the number ?f ?ositive _root~ the equation f(-x) = o. Let 
, be the number of variations of signs 1n the sequence of coefficients of 
f (-x). By the rule, v' = r' + 2h where his a non-negative integer. 
2 If J(x) = 0 be an equation of degree n with real coefficients having 
~ zero root and v, v' are respectively the number of variations of signs 
: the sequence of coefficients of f(x) and f(-x) such that v + v' < n, 
then the equation f(x) = 0 has at least n - (v + v') complex roots. 
proof. Let r be the number of positive roots and r' be that of negative 
roots of the equation f(x) = 0. Then by the rule, v = r + 2h and 
v' = r' + 2h' where h, h' are non-negative integers. 
Therefore r < v, r' < v' and n - (r + r') > n - (v + v'). 
But n - (r + r') is the number of complex roots of the equation 
f (x) = 0 and the assertion is established. 
3. If all the roots of the equation f(x) = 0 be non-zero real and v~ v' are 
respectively the number of variations of signs in the sequence of coeffi-
cients of f ( x) and / ( - x) then the equation f ( x) = 0 has v positive roots 
and v' negative roots. 
Proof. Let r, r' be respectively the number of positive and negative roots 
of f(x) = 0 and let n be its degree. Then r+r' = n. Again the minimum 
number of complex roots of the equation is n - ( v + v'), by deduction 2. 
Since all the roots are real, n - (v + v') = 0. Therefore r + r' = 
v+v' = n. 
By tbe rule, v > rand v' > .r'~ But v > rand v+v' = r+r' =} v' < r', 
a contradiction. 
Therefore v = r and consequently v' = r'.

(i) Let f(x) = x 4 + 2x2 + 3x - 1. 
Then f(-x) = x 4 + 2x2 - 3x -1. 
The signs in the sequence of coefficients of f ( x) are + + +-·

(ii) Letf(x)=x6 +x4 +x2 +x+3. 
Then f(-x) = x 6 + x 4 + x 2 - x + 3. 
The signs in the sequence of coefficients of I ( X) are + + + + +. 
As there is no variation of signs the equation has no positive root. 
The signs in the sequence of coefficients of f(-x) are+++-+. 
There are 2 variations of signs. Therefore the number of negative 
roots of the equation f(x) = 0 is either 2 or 0. 
The equation has no zero root. Therefore the number of real roots is 
either 2 or 0. 
The equation being of degree 6 has 6 roots. Consequently, the number 
of complex roots of the equation is either 4 or 6. 
7. Let f(x) be a complete polynomial, with real coefficients and v, v' are 
respectively the number of variations and continuations of signs in the 
sequence of its coefficients. If all roots of / ( x) = 0 are real prove that 
the equation has v positive roots and v' negative roots. 
[A polynomial aoxn + a 1xn-l + • • • + an is said to be a complete 
polynomial if no ai is zero.] 
_Since / ( x) is a complete polynomial, if two consecutive elements in 
the sequence of coefficients of f ( x) show a variation of signs then the two 
corresponding elements in the sequence of coefficients of f(-x) show a 
continuation of signs and vice-versa. 
Therefore v' is the number of variations of signs in the sequence of 
coefficients of f(-x). 
Since f(x) is a complete polynomial, O is. not a root of f(x) = O. By 
deduction 3 of the rule, the desired result is derived. 
5.3.5. Sturm's method for location of roots.

storm's ~unctions .. Le~ f(x) be a polynomial with real coefficients and 
Ji (x) be its first derivative. L~t the operation of finding the h.c.f. of 
f ( x) and /1 ( x) be performed with the following modification. 
"The sign of each :emainder is to be changed before it is used as the 
next divisor and the sign of the last remainder is also to be changed." 
The modified remainders (i.e., the remainders with their signs 
changed) are denoted by /2(x), f 3(x), . . . , fr(x). 
J(x),f1(x), ... ,fr(x) 
are 
called 
Sturm's 
functions 
and 
Ji(x), f2(x), ... , fr(x) are called auxiliary functions. 
In the usual process of finding the h.c.f. of two polynomials we can 
multiply ( or divide) any remainder by a constant, positive or negative 
but in this modified process of forming Strum's auxiliary functions it is 
essential that such multipliers should be positive. 
If q1 ( x), q2 ( x), ... , Qr- 1 ( x) be the quotients in the successive steps, 
the Sturm's functions f, /1, /2, ... , fr are connected by the equations

It is to be observed that the last remainder - fr ( x) is a constant if 
f(x) has no multiple root. But if f(x) has multiple roots then the h.c.f. 
of f(x) and f 1(x) is a polynomial, say p(x). In this case all the Sturm's 
functions are divisible by p(x) and the remainder - fr(x) = p(x)</>r(x), 
where c/>r(x) is a constant. 
We state below without proof Sturm's theorem for locating the posi-
tion of real roots of an equation.

Remarks. The calculation of Sturm's functions becomes very often 
laborious. But labour may be saved by the following considerations. 
1. If there is no multiple root the last function Ir ( x) is a constant and 
its sign only is required. Let a be a root of l r-i(x) = 0 then lr-2(a) 
and fr(a) are of opposite signs, since fr-2(a) = Qr-llr-i(a) - lr(a). 
Therefore the sign of Ir ( x) can be ascertained from the calculation of 
fr-2(0:). Thus the labour of actual calculation of the constant lr(x) can 
be saved. 
2. If at any stage we obtain a function Is ( x) such that all of its roots are 
complex, then the h.c.f. process need not be continued further and the 
determination and location of real roots will be possible from the set of 
functions l(x), l 1(x), ... , f 8 (x), because ls(x) retains the same sign for 
all values of x and no alteration in the number of changes of sign can 
take place in the sequence of functions beyond Is ( x). 
Condition that all roots may be real and distinct. 
Let l(x) be a polynomial of degree n with leading coefficient positive. 
In order to ensure the existence of n distinct real roots, n changes of signs 
must be lost in the sequence of Sturm's functions as x changes from -oo 
to oo. Therefore n + 1 functions must be present in the sequence and the 
leading coefficients of all these functions must be positive.

5.5. Symmetric functions of roots. 
A function f of two or more variables is said to be a symmetric func-
tion if f remains unaltered by an interchange of any two of its variables. 
For example, J(x, y, z) = x2y2 + y2 z2 + z2x2 is a symmetric function 
of x, y, z. J(x, y, z) = xy + yz is not symmetric in x, y, z, because f does 
not remain unaltered if x and y are interchanged. 
A symmetric function of the roots of an equation is an expression 
that involves all the roots alike and the expression remains unaltered if 
any two of the roots be interchanged. 
For example, if o:, /3,, be the roots of a cubic equation, o:2 + {32 + 1
2 
is a symmetric function of the roots, while 0:2/3 + 132"/ + ,20 is not a 
symmetric function.

Let a1, a2, . . . , an be the roots of the equation 
f(x) = Xn + P1Xn-l + P2Xn-2 + · · · + Pn = 0 
and let Sr = a1 r + a2 r + · · · + an r, where r is an integer > 0. Then

5.6. Transformation of equations. 
When an equation is given it is possible, without knowing its indi-
vidual roots, to obtain a new equation whos_e roots are connected With 
those of the equation by some assigned relation. The meth0d of finding 
the new equation is said to be a trans/ ormation. Such a tr~nsformation 
sometimes helps us to study the nature of the roots of the given equation 
which would have been otherwise a difficult job. 
We will discuss some typical transformation and then take up the 
general problem. 
5.6.1. To transform an equation whose roots are 01, 02, • ••,an into 
another whose roots are ma1, ma2, ... , man. 
Let the equation whose roots are 01, 02, . . . , On be 
Xn + P1Xn-l + P2Xn-2 + · · · + Pn = 0. 
Let y = ma1. 
Then 01 = y/m. 
Since a 1 is a root of the given equation, 
01 n + P10'.1 n-l + P20'.1n-2 + · · · + Pn = 0. 
Therefore (-;i)n + P1(-;i)n-l + P2(-;i)n-2 + · · · + Pn = 0 
or, yn + P1myn-l + p2m2yn-2 + .. . + Pnmn = 0. 
(A) 
This is the transformed equation. 
[Explanation. ma1 is obviously a root of the equation (A). We would 
obtain the same equation (A) if we put y = mai, where ai is any root of 
the given equation. This proves that ma1, ma2, . .. , man are the roots 
of the equation (A). Since the equation (A) is of degree n, the roots 
ma1, ma2, ... , man are the only roots of it.] 
Note 1. We observe that the successive coefficients of the transformed 
equation are obtained by multiplying the successive coefficients of the 
given equation, beginning from the 1st, by 1, m, m 2, . . . , m n respectively. 
Corollary. The transformed equation whose roots are -a1, -a2, · · · 
-an is obtained by changing the signs of the coefficients beginning fro11l 
the second, alternately. 
Note 2. The transformation is useful for the purpose of removing frac-
tional coefficients of an equation or reducing the leading coefficient of 311 
equation to unity. We are to choose a suitable multiplier of the roots 50 
that the transformed equation will have all integral coefficients with the 
leading coefficient unity.

1 ·ble constant so that the fractional coefficients of the equation ma:y

:Multiplying the roots by 6 the transformed equation becomes 
x4 + 6. ½x3 - 36. ½x2 + 216. ¼x + 1296. 1

2 = 0 
or, x4 + 3x3 - 12x
2 + 54x + 540 = 0. 
2. One root of the equation 32x3 -14x + 3 = 0 is double another. Solve 
the equation. 
The equation whose roots are double those of the given equation is 
32x3 - 56x + 24 = 0 or, 4x3 - 7 x + 3 = 0. 
Hence the equations 32x3 - 14x + 3 = 0 and 4x3 - 7x + 3 = 0 have a 
common root. 
The h.c.f. of 32x3 - 14x + 3 and 4x3 - 7x + 3 is 2x - 1. 
Therefore ½ and ¼ are roots of the given equation. The other root is 
-}. Hence the roots of the given equation are ½, ¼, -£. 
5.6.2. To transform an equation into one whose roots are reciprocal of 
the roots of a given equation. 
Let the given equation be aoxn+a1xn-1+a2xn-2+- · ·+an-1x+an = 0 
and let the roots be 01, 02, ... , On. 
It is assumed that none of the roots is zero. 
Let y = (l/01). 
Then 01 = (1/y). 
Sincea1 is a root, aoo1n+a101n-1+a201n-2 + • · •+an-101 +an= 0. 
Therefore ao(½)n + a1(½)n-l + a2(¼)n-2 + · · · + an-1(¼) +an= 0 
or, anyn + an-lYn-1 + ... + a1y + ao = 0. 
This is the transformed equation. 
~ote. The coefficients of the given equation appear in the reverse order 
lil the transformed equation.

5.6.3. Let a 1 , a 2 , ... , an be the roots of the equation 
f(x) = aoXn + a1Xn + X1Xn-l +···+an= 0. 
To find the equation whose roots are a1 - h, a2 - h, · · · , 0 n - h, where h 
is a constant. 
Let y = a 1 - h. Then a1 = y + h. 
Since a1 is a root, aoa1 n + a1a1 n-l +·· · +an = 0. 
or, ao(Y + h)n + a1 (y + h)n-l +···+an = 0. 
This can be expressed as Aoxn + A1xn-l + · ··+An= 0, where An is 
the remainder when f ( x) is divided by x - h and let q1 ( x) be the quotient; 
An-l is the remainder when the quotient q1 ( x) is divided by x - h and 
let q2(x) be the quotient. 
Repeating the same process, An-2, An-3, . .. , A1 are obtained as the 
successive remainders and finally Ao = ao. 
Note. Here the transformation that is applied to the equation is given 
by X = y+ h.

(i) Let a, /3,, be the roots of the given equation. To find the equation 
whose roots are a - 4, /3 - 4, , - 4. 
Let y = a - 4. Then a = y + 4. 
Since a is a root of the given equation, a 3 + 3a2 - 8a + 1 = O. 
Therefore (y + 4)3 + 3(y + 4)2 - 8(y + 4) + 1 = O 
or, y
3 + 15y
2 + 64y + 81 = 0. This is the required equation. 
(ii) To find the equation whose roots are a+ 1, f3 + l,, + 1. 
Let y = a + l. Then a = y - l. 
Since a is a root of the given equation, 0 3 + 30 2 _ 8a + 1 = O. 
Therefore (y - 1)3 + 3(y - 1)2 - 8(y - 1) + 1 = o

Here the required equation is x4 + 8y3 + 16y2 +By+ 6 = O. 
Note. The transformation can be utilised to remove a specified term 
from an equation. We are to choose a suitable h so that the ith coefficient 
of the transformed equation may be zero. Such a transformation often 
facilitates the solution of the given equation. 
6. Transform the equation x 4 + 4x3 + 7 x 2 + 6x - 4 = 0 
into one which shall want the second term and hence solve the given 
equation. 
Let us apply the transformation x = y + h so that the transformed 
equation may want the second term. 
The transformed equation is 
(y + h)4 + 4(y + h)a + 7(y + h)2 + 6(y + h) - 4 = 0

2 + 14h + 6) + 
(h + 4h3 + 7h2 + 6h - 4) = O. 
By the given condition 4h + 4 = 0, 
i.e., h = -1. 
The equation reduces to y4 + y2 - 6 = 0. 
. 
The roots of the transformed equation are ±v2, ±y'3i. 
Hence the roots of the given equation are -1 ± v2, - l ± y'3i.

Therefore /3 = /·-q 
[Note that here ¢(x, y) = 0 is x(y - q) - r == O.]

Let us find the equation whose roots are 2a, 2/3, 21 , 28 and the equa-

The h.c.f. of the polynomials f (y) and ¢(y) is y + 2.

Theorem 5.7.1. If J(x) = O be a reciprocal equation of degree n and 
of the first type then f(x) = xn !(¾)-
Conversely, if f(x) be a polynomial of degree n and f(x) = xnf(¾) then 
f ( x) = 0 is a reciprocal equation of the first type. 
Proof. Let f(x) = a0xn + a1xn-l + · ··+an, 
an f:. 0. 
Since f ( x) = O is a reciprocal equation of the first type, 
ao = an, a1 = an- 1, ... , an = ao. 
Therefore f(x) = aoxn + an-1Xn-l + · · · + ao

Then xn J(¾) = xn(~ + x~!.1 + ·· ·+an)

Since J(x) = xn !(¾), ao = an, a1 = an-l, . .. , an= ao, 
This shows that f ( x) = 0 is a reciprocal equation of the first type. 
This completes the proof. 
Theorem 5.7.2. If f(x) = 0 be a reciprocal equation of degree n and 
of the second type then f(x) = -xn !(¾), 
Conversely, if f(x) be a polynomial of degree n and f(x) = -xnf(¾)

Theorem 5. 7.3. The solution of any reciprocal equation depends on

YI>e 
Proof. Let the equation be a0x2m + a1x2m-l + · · · + a2m = 0. 
Since it is of the first type, a2m = ao, a2m-l = a1, ... , am+1 == am-i. 
Therefore the equation reduces to 
ao(x2m +I)+ a1x(x2m-2 +I)+· ·· + amXm = 0. 
Dividing by xm, we have

U2 = t2 - 2,

Dividing by x 2 , we have 
6(x2 + ~) + 35(x + ¼) + 62 = 0

3. Prove that the equation

if a f; 1 and solve it when a= -2. 
Let J(x) = (x + 1)4 - a(x4 + 1). 
When a = l, f(0) = 0 and therefore f(x) = 0 is not a reciprocal

J(¾) = (¾ + l)4 _ a(;4 + l) = (l+x)

Therefore f ( x) = x4 f ( ¾) and this proves that f ( x) = 0 is a reciprocal

When a= -2, the equation is (x + 1)4 + 2(x4 + 1) = 0

This will be a reciprocal equation if m 4 = n4 - 7n3 + 13n2 -12n+6 
and m2(4n - 7) = (4n3 - 21n2 + 26n - 12). 
Therefore (4n3-21n2+26n-12)2 = (4n-7)2(n4-7n3+13n2-12n+6)

Taking m = 1, n = l, 
the equation is y4 - 3y3 - 2y2 - 3y + 1 == o

Since d =I- 0, none of a, /3,, is zero.

II. H m, n are integers prime to each other, the equations xm _ 1 :::: 
0 
and xn -1 = O have no common root except l. 
Proof. Since m and n are prime to each other, there exist integers a and 
b such that am+ bn = I. 
Let o be a common root of xm - 1 = 0 and xn - 1 = 0. 
Then om = 1 and on = 1. 
Therefore o = aam+bn = (Om) a· ( On )h = 1. 
This proves that 1 is the only common root. 
III. If d be the g.c.d. of m and n, the common roots of xm - 1 :::: 0 
and xn - 1 = O are roots of xd - 1 = 0 and conversely, all the roots of 
xd -1 = 0 are common roots of xm -1 = 0 and xn -1 = 0. 
Proof. Since d is the g.c.d. of m and n there exist integers m', n' prime 
to each other such that m = dm', n = dn'. 
Since m' and n' are prime to each other, there exist integers a ~nd b 
such that am' + bn' = 1. 
Let a be a common root of xm -1 = 0 and xn - l = 0. 
Then am = 1 and an = 1. 
Therefore ad = ad(am'+bn') = 
(adm')a.(Odn')h = 1. 
This proves that a is a root of xd - 1 = 0. 
Conversely, let /3 be a root of xd - 1 = 0. Then {3d = 1. 
Therefore /3dm' = 1 and f3dn' = 1. 
That is, 13m = 1 and 13n = 1. 
Hence /3 is a common root of xm -1 = 0 and xn -1 = 0.

This shows that the equations xn -
I = o and xp-q _ 1 = 0 have a 
common in1aginary root a. But since n is a prime and p - q < n, 11 is 
prime to p - q and therefore the equations xn _ I = o and :i.:p-q - 1 == O 
cannot have a. com1uon root other than 1.

whose roots are a + 2a4 , a 2 + 2a3, a 3 + 2a2 , a 4 + 2a. 
Since 5 is a prime and a is an imaginary root of x 5 - 1 = 0, all the

Therefore a, a 2 , a 3 , a 4 are the roots of the equation x4 + x3 + x2 + 
x + 1 = 0 and 2a, 2a2 , 2a3 , 2a4 are the roots of the equation x4 + 2x3 +

Therefore (x4 + x3 + x2 + x + l)(x4 + 2x3 + 4x2 +Bx+ 16)

Theorem 5.9.1. The special roots of the equation xn - 1 = O are

Let us consider the following cases.

This shows that cos 2:1r + i sin 2:1r is a root of the equation xn' -1 = 0 
where n' < n and hence cos 2r1r + i sin 2r1r cannot be a special root of 
n 
n 
the equation xn - 1 = 0. 
Case II. r is prime to n. We prove that cos 2:1r + i sin 2:1r cannot be 
a root of the equation xm - 1 = 0, where mis any positive integer less 
than n. 
If possible, let (cos 2:1r + i sin 2:1r)m = 1 where 0 < m < n. 
Then cos 2rm1r + i sin 2mr1r = 1. 
n 
n 
This requires rm must be divisible by n. But since r is prime to n, m 
must be divisible by n which cannot happen since m < n . 
This proves that cos 2r1r + i sin~ is a special root of xn - 1 = 0. 
n 
n 
Note 1. If n be a prime number, every root of the equation xn - 1 = 0 
except 1 is a special root. 
Note 2. A non-special root of the equation xn -1 = 0 is a root of the 
equation xm - 1 = o for some m < n. Since the common roots of the 
:~ations xn - 1 = o and xm _ 1 = O are the roots of xd - 1 = 0, where

given by the roots of the equations x - 1 = 0 and x

3 are the only divisors of 9 and less than 9. 
Note 3. The number of special roots of the equation xn - 1 == 0 is the 
number of positive integers less than n and prime to n. Thus the number 
of the special roots of the equation xn - 1 = 0 is ¢( n), where </> is the

Note. The special root of the equation xn - 1 = 0 are the roots of a 
reciprocal equation of degree </>( n). 
Theorem 5.9.3. If a be a special root of the equation xn - 1 = 0, 
· then 1, a, a 2, ... , an-l is a complete list of distinct roots of the equation 
xn -1 = 0. 
Proof. First we prove that no two of 1, a, a 2 , .. . , an-l are equal. 
If possible, let aP = aq where O < p < n - 1, O < q < n - 1 and p > q. 
Then ap-q = 1. 
This shows that a is a root of the equation xP-q - 1 = O whose degree 
is less than n and consequently, a is not a special root of the equation 
xn - 1 = 0, a contradiction. Therefore no two of 1, a, a 2 , ... , an-l are 
equal. 
Again each of 1, a, a 2, ... , an-l is a root of xn - 1 = O. Since these

Theorem 5.9.6. Let n = pq, where p and q are prime to each other. If 
a be a special root of the equation xP - 1 = O and f3 be a special root 
of the equation xq - 1 = 0, then a/3 is a special root of the equation 
xn -1 = 0. 
Proof. (a/3)n = (af3)Pq = 1 and therefore a/3 is a root of the equation 
xn - 1 = 0. 
Let (af3)k = 1. Then ak = 13-k. Therefore aqk = 13-qk. 
/3 being a root of xq - 1 = 0, f3q = l and therefore 0 qk = 1. 
Since a is a special root of xP - 1 = o and 0 qk = l, it follows that 
qk > p. 
Let qk = sp + r wheres and rare integers and O < r < p. 
1 = aqk => 1 = asp+r => 1 = ar. 
-
Therefore r = 0 and hence qk is divisible by p. 
Since p and q are prime to each other, qk is divisible by p implies k 
is divisible by p.

BY similar arguments, k is divisible by q. 
Since p and q are prime to each other, k is divisible by n. 
Therefore ( a/3)k = 1 => k is divisible by n. This proves that a/3 is a 
·a1 root of the equation xn - 1 = O.

Note 1. The theorem can be generalised. 
Let n == P1P2•••Pr, where P1, P2, •··, Pr are pairwise relatively primes or 
powers of pairwise relatively primes. If a 1 be a special root of xP1 -1 = o,

then a1 a2 ... Cir 1s a spec1a root o the equation xn - l = o. 
Note 2. Hp and q are relatively prime, ¢(pq) = ¢(p).¢(q). Therefore 
the number of special roots of xPq - 1 = 0 are obtained by multiplying 
each of the ¢(p) special root of xP -
l = 0 by each of the ¢>( q) special 
root of xq - l = 0. 
In particular, let n _ pq, where p, q are distinct primes. 
Ha be a special root of xP - l = 0 and f3 be a special root of xq - l = 0, 
then the special roots of xn - l = 0 are (p-l)(q-l) terms in the product 
(a+a2 + · • • + aP-l )((3 + (32 + · · · + 13q-l ), since each term in the product 
is a special root of xPq - l = 0 and there are <p(pq) terms in the product. 
Examples. 
I. 6 = 2.3. 2 and 3 are relatively prime. The special roots of x3 -1 = 0 
are w, w2; and the only special root of x 2 - 1 = 0 is -1. 
Hence the special roots of x 6 - 1 = 0 are -w, -w2 , i.e., 1±f3i. 
Note. The special roots of x3 -1 = 0 are all non-real roots of x3 -1 = 0. 
Hence the special roots of x 6 - l = 0 are negative of all the non-real roots 
of the equation x 3 - 1 = O. But the equation whose roots are negative of 
the roots of the equation x 3 - 1 = 0 is x 3 + 1 = 0. 
Therefore the special roots of x 6 - 1 = 0 are all the non-real roots of the 
equation x3 + 1 = o. 
The number of special roots of xn - l = O. 
1. If n be a prime, the number of integers less than n and prime to n is 
n - I. Therefore the number of special roots of xn - 1 = 0 is n - 1. 
~· If n == p0 , where p is a prime and a is a positive integer > -1, the

Let a, /3,, be the roots of the given equation.

Let us apply the transformation x = y + h in order to remove the 
second term. 
The equation transforms to 
(y + h)3 + 9(y + h)2 + 24(y + h) + 20 = 0 
or, y3 + (3h + 9)y2 + (3h2 + 18h + 24)y + (h3 + 9h2 + 24h + 20) = 0. 
Since the second term of this equation is to be absent, h = -3. 
The transformed equation is y3 - 3y + 2 = O. 
The roots of the transformed equation are a + 3, /3 + 3, 1 + 3. 
Let a' = o. + 3, /3' = f3 + 3, ,' = , + 3.

By Descartes' rule of signs, this equation has at least one negative

5.11.2. The general solution of a cubic. Cardan's method. 
Let the cubic equation be 
ax3 + 3bx2 + 3cx + d = 0 
(i) 
This can be put in the standard form z3 + 3H z + G = 0, 
where z = ax+ b, H = ac - b2 , G = a2d - 3abc + 2b3 • 
To solve the equation, let us assume z = u + v. 
Then z3 = u3 + v3 + 3uv(u + v) = u3 + v3 + 3uvz 
or, z3 - 3uvz - (u3 + v3 ) = 0. 
Comparing this with z3 + 3Hz + G = 0, we have 
uv=-H u3 +v3 =-G. 
Therefore u3 = ½(- G + ✓G2 + 4H3), v3 = ½(- G - ✓a2 + 4H3). 
If p denotes any one of the three values of { ½ ( -G + ✓ 
Q2 + 4H3) }1/3, 
then the three values of u are p, wp, w2p where w is an imaginary cube 
root of unity. 
And since uv = - H, the three coresponding values of v are 
-H - w2 H

Therefore ,\ = 5, 7, 1l .

The equation takes the form

or, (x2 - 5x + 6)(x2 - 5x + 4) = O 
or, (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - l)(x - 4) = 0. 
Therefore x = 2, 3, 1, 4. 
Hence the roots of the equation are 1, 2, 3, 4.

equation f (x) = 0. 
x4 + 6x2 + 14x2 + 22x + 5 = (x2 + 3x + .X)2 - (ax+ {3)2• 
Equating coefficients of like powers of x, we have 
14 = 9 + 2.X - a 2 , or o.2 = 2.X - 5; 
22 = 6-X - 2a/3, or a/3 = 3.X - 11;

Therefore ,X = 3, 2 ± 2vrsi. 
Taking .X = 3, we have a = ±1, f3 = ±2 and a/3 = -2. 
Therefore a and f3 are of opposite signs. 
The equation can be expressed as 
( x2 + 3x + 3 )2 -
( x - 2 )2 = 0

5.12.3. Descartes' method of solution of a biquadratic equation. 
Let the biquadratic equation be taken in the standard form

(i) 
To solve the equation, let us express the left hand expression as the 
product of two factors in the form 
(x2 + lx + m)(x2 - lx + n). 
Comparing with the left hand expression of (i) we have 
m + n - l2 = 6H

m + n

l(n-m) = 4G

This is a cubic equation in l2 giving l. Then m and n can be deter-

Note. Unless the cubic equation (v) has rational roots, the numerical 
work for finding the roots of the equation (i) becomes laborious.

We define A2un = A(Aun) = A(un+l - Un). 
The sequence (A2u1, A2u2, A2u3 , .•.•• • ) is said to be the second 
order of differences of the sequence (un). 
In a similar manner the pth order of differences APun where pis a 
positive integer, can be defined for the sequence (un), 
It follows immediately that 
(i) if Un = k, a constant for all n then Aun = 0 for all n, and con-
versely; 
(ii) If (Un) be a sequence in an arithmetic progression having the com-
mon difference d then A Un = constant = d for all n and conversely. 
(iii) If { un} be a sequence in a geometric progression having the com-
mon ratio r then the sequence ( A Un) is also in geometric progression of 
common ratio r.

Theorem 6.3.1. Let (un) be a sequence and f:l.P denote the pth order 
difference operator. Then 
Un= U1 + (n~l)6.u1 + (n;-1)6.2u1 + ... + (n;l)6.ru1 + ... +6.n-lu1. 
Proof. We prove the theorem by the method of induction. 
The theorem is obviously true for n = 1. 
Let us assume the theorem to be true for n = m , where m is a 
positive integer. 
Then Um= U1 + {m1 1)Au1 + (m2 1)6.2u1 + · · · + (m;1)6.ru1 + · · · + 
Am-1

Therefore Aum = 
6.u1 + (m1 1)6.2u1 + (m2

(m;l)6.r+lu1 + ... + Amu1, 
Hence Um+l

+[(:i.=-i1) + (m;1)]6.ru1 + ... + 6.mu1 
U1 + (7)6.ui + · · · + (';)6.ru1 + • · • + 6.mu1-
This shows that the theorem is true for n = m + I if it be true for 
n = m. And the theorem is true for n = 1. 
By the principle of induction, the theorem holds for all positive in-
tegers n. 
Corollary. If p be the least positive integer such that (6.Pu11) is a 
sequence of equal elements, then Un is a polynomial in n of degree P· 
Because in this case all the sequences of (p + 1 )th and the higher orders 
of differences are sequences of zeros. 
~ 
Therefore Un = u1 + (n - l)du.1 + · · · + (n- l)(n- 2) • • • (n-p) pl 
= a polynomial in n of degree p.

The successive orders of differences are

19 ... 
4

Therefore Un = 3 + (n - 1)7 + (n-lMn-2) .4 
= 2n2 +n. 
· 
Alternatively, Un is a polynomial in n of degree 2, since the second 
order of differences is a sequence of equal elements. 
Let u1 = an2 + bn + c. 
Since u1 
-
3, 
a+ b + c = 3; 
since u2 = 10, 
4a + 2b + c = 10; 
sinceu3 = 21, 
9a+3b+c=21. 
These determine a = 2, b = 1, c = 0. 
Therefore Un= 2n2 + n.

Un-3 = 0, n > 3. 
If the scale of relation and a sufficient number of terms from the

Conversely, if a sufficient number of terms from the beginning of a 
recurring series be given then the scale of relation can be determined.

6.5. C + iS method of summation. 
We now discuss a method of finding the sum of two real series 
ao + a1 cos 0 + a2 cos 20 + · .. · · · (i) 
a1 sin0 + a2 sin 20 + · · · · · · (ii) 
where 0 is real and a0 , a1, a2, • • • are constants. 
Let the complex series 
ao + a1eiO + a2e2iO + ...... (iii) 
be convergent for some 0 and f ( 0) be the sum. Let f ( 0) be expressed 
as A + iB where A, B are real. Then 
A+ iB = a0 + a1(cos0 + isin0) + a2(cos20 + isin20) + · · · 
This implies the convergence of the series (i) and (ii) and 
A = ao + a1 cos 0 + a2 cos 20 + · · · · · · 
B = a1 sin 0 + a2 sin 20 + · · · · · · 
Therefore in order to find the sum of either of the series (i) and 
(ii) we try to find the sum of the complex series (iii) in its region of 
convergence and then express the sum f(0) in the form C + iS where 
C and S are real. 
The sums of the series ( i) and (ii) for the corresponding 0 are given 
by C and S respectively.

where a's and b's are all integers with bi =I

a1 +_h_J?.a_ · · • 
a2+ a3+ 
a1, t, ! , · · · are called elements of the continued fraction. 
If the number of elements be finite, the continued fraction is said to 
be a finite continued fraction. 
If the number of elements be infinite, the continued fraction is said 
to be an infinite continued fraction. 
The value of the fraction obtained by stopping at some stage is called 
a convergent of the continued fraction. 
For the continued fraction a1 + b2+ b3+ ...

As the number of convergents is finite in a finite continued fraction, 
the value qf the last convergent gives the value of a finite continued 
fraction. 
In an infinite continued fraction, the number of convergents is clearly 
infinite. If u1 , u2 , u3 , • • • be the successive convergents of the continued 
fraction, the continued fraction is said to be convergent if the sequence 
{un} be convergent. In this case lim Un is said to be the value of the 
continued fraction.

By the principle of induction, the relations hold for all n > 3. 
Note. If we write Po= 1, qo = 0 then p2, q2 can be expressed as 
P2 = a2p1 + Po, 
Q2 = a2q1 + Qo• 
This shows that the recurrence relations 
Pn = anPn-1 + Pn- 2, 
Qn = anQn-1 + Qn-2 
hold for all n > 2 with the assumed initial values Po = 1, q0 = 0. 
If a simple continued fraction be finite then there is a finite number 
of quotients and the last convergent gives the value of the continued 
fraction. 
Since each convergent Un is of the form ~ where Pn, qn are positive 
integers, each convergent is a rational number and therefore the value of 
a finite simple continued fraction is a positive rational number. 
We now show that every positive rational number can be expressed 
as a finite simple continued fraction. 
Theorem 7.2.2. Every positive rational number r can be expressed as 
a finite simple continued fraction. 
Proof. Let r =E be a positive rational number, where p, q are integers 
q 
and p > 0, q > 0. 
~ase 1. p > q. Let us divide p by q. By division algorithm, there exist 
llltegers a 1 and r 1 such that p = a1q + r1 where a1 > 1, 0 < r 1 < q.

Since q is a positive integer and ri's are all integers > 0, we shall

Theorem 7.2.3. A positive irrational number can be expressed as an

Thus the representation of a as an infinite simple continued fraction

Note. Before coming to the converse problem whether an infinite simple

tain whether an infinite simple continued fraction has a value at all, i.e., 
whether the sequence of convergents of an infinite simple continued frac-

for n > 2, 
Pn = anPn-1 + Pn-2, qn = anQn-1 + qn-2• 
Since p1qo - Poq1 = -1, the statement is true for n = 1. 
Let us assume that the statement is true for n = m, where mis a

Then Pmqm-1 - Pm-lqm = (-l)m 
(am+lPm + Pm-1)qm - Pm(am+lqm - qm-1)

-(-l)m = (-l)m+l. 
This shows that the statement is true for n = m + 1 if it is true for 
n = rn. By the principle of induction the statement is true for all n EN.

In Theorem 3.2.15 we have seen that the equation ax+ by= c where 
a b, care integers and (a, b) /= (0, 0), has an integral solution if and only 
if gcd( a, b) is a divisor of c.

prime to each other. 
Let t be expressed as a simple continued fraction with an even num-

ber of quotients. Let b' be the convergent immediately preceding b . 
Then ab' - a'b = 1. 
This shows that (b', a') is a solution of the equation. 
Also we have ax - by = ab' - a' b 
or, a(x - b') = b(y - a'). 
Since a and b are prime to each other, b is a divisor of x - b' and a is 
a divisor of y - a'.

Therefore xb = y~a = t, where tis an integer 
or, x = bt + b' 
y = at+ a' , where t = 0, ±1, ±2, • · • 
This gives the general solution in integers. 
Note. If c be a positive integer, then the general solution of the equation 
ax - by = c where a, b are positive integers prime to each other is given 
by x = bt + b'c 
y =at+ a'c, where t = 0, ±1, ±2, · · · 
2. The equation ax - by = -1 where a and b are positive integers 
prime to each other. 
Let t be expressed as a simple continued fraction with an odd number 
of quotients. Let ~; be the convergent immediately preceding i. Then 
ab' - a'b = -1. 
This shows that (b', a') is a solution of the equation. 
Also we have ax - by = ab' - a' b 
or, a(x - b') = b(y - a'). 
Since a and b are prime to each other, b is a divisor of x - b' and a is 
a divisor of y - a'. 
Therefore xbb' = y~a' = t, where t is an integer. 
or, x = bt + b'

Let f be expressed as a simple continued fraction with an even num-

Then ab' - a'b = 1. 
This shows that (b', -a') is a solution of the equation. 
Also we have ax + by = ab' - a' b 
or, a(x - b') = b(-y - a'). 
Since a and b are prime to each other, b is a divisor of x - b' and a is 
a divisor of -y - a'. 
Therefore xbb' = 11~:' = t, where tis an integer. 
or, x = bt + b' 
y = -at - a', where t = 0, ±1, ±2, · · · 
This gives the general solution in integers. 
Note. If c be a positive integer, then the general solution of the equation

Hence 14x -19y = 14.15 - 19.11 
or, 14(x - 15) = 19(y - 11) 
319 
Since 14 and 19 are prime to each other, 19 is a divisor of x-15 and 
14 is a divisor of y - 11. 
Therefore x1: 5 = y~l = t, where tis an integer. 
The general solution is x = 19t + 15 
y = 14t + 11, where t = 0, ±1, ±2, · · · 
Note. From (A) it follows that (15, 11) is a solution of the equation. 
This solution is given by the convergent immediately preceding f:.

Hence 14x - 19y = 14.4 - 19.3 
or, 14(x - 4) = 19(y - 3) 
Since 14 and 19 are prime to each other, 19 is a divisor of x - 4 and 
14 is a divisor of y - 3. 
Therefore x19
4 = U~3 = t, where tis an integer. 
The general solution is x = 19t + 4 
y = 14t + 3 where t = 0, ±1, ±2, • • • 
Note. From (A) it follows that (4, 3) is a solution of the equation. This 
solution is given by the convergent immediately preceding ~:. 
3. Solve the equation 14x - 19y = 5 in integers. 
Proceeding as in Example 1, we have 14.15 - 19.11 = 1. 
Hence 14x - 19y = 5(14.15 - 19.11) 
or, 14(x - 75) = 19(y - 55) 
Since 14 and 19 are prime to each other, 19 is a divisor of x - 75 and 
14 is a divisor of y - 55. 
Therefore x1:s = U1t5 = t, where tis an integer. 
The general solution is x = 19t + 75 
y = 14t + 55 where t = 0, ±1, ±2, ... 
Note. The least solution in positive integers corresponds tot= -3. The 
least solution is (18, 13).

Since qn, qn-l, qn_2 , an are all positive, it follows that Un -
Un-1 and

Un-2 are of opposite signs. 
Therefore Un lies between two preceding convergents Un-1 and Un-2. 
But u1 = a1, 
u2 = a1 + .1... > u1. 
a2 
U1 < U2 => U1 < U3 < U2 
U3 < U2 => U3 < U4 < U2 
U3 < U4 => U3 < U5 < U4 
U5 < U4 => U5 < U6 < U4 
Hence u1 < u3 < us < · · · < u4 < u6 < u2. 
Thus the sequence of odd convergents { u2n-1} is a strictly increasing 
sequence, bounded above and the sequence of even convergents { u2n} is 
a strictly decreasing sequence, bounded below. 
Therefore both the sequences are convergent.

As qn ➔ 00 as n ➔ oo, lim(u2n - U2n-1) = 0. 
So lim U2n = 
lim U2n- 1 = l, say. Therefore both the sequences { u2n-i} and {u2n} 
converge to the same limit l and the sequence { un} converges to l. 
Since l is the limit of the strictly increasing sequence { u2n-l}, Z is the 
lub of the sequence { u2n-1}. 
Since l is the limit of the strictly decreasing sequence { u2n}, l is the 
glb of the sequence { U2n}. 
Therefore u1 < u3 < us < · · · < l < · · · < u6 < u 4 < u 2. 
Hence every infinite simple continued fraction is convergent and 
(i) its value is greater than every odd convergent, 
(ii) 
its value is less than every even convergent. 
This completes the proof.

Therefore 13 sidereal preiods of venus ~ 8 sidereal periods of the 
earth. In other words, the transit of venus will occur after every 8 years. 
Again, ~ is a better approximation to the value of the continued 
fraction. Hence the transit will occur after every 243 years, more accu-
rately.

7.6. Recurring simple continued fraction. 
A simple continued fraction

1 
ai + a2+ a3+ · · · 
is said to be a recurring continued fraction if after a certain stage the 
elements recur in the same order. The recurring elements form the cyclic 
part and the non-recurring elements, if they exist, form the acyclic part 
of the continued fraction. 
For example, the continued fraction 
l + 2~ 3~ 4~ 3~ 4~ ••• 
is a recurring continued fraction. Here 1 + ½ is the acyclic part and 3~ ¼ 
is the cycle. 
The cycle is denoted by putting * under the first and the last element 
of the cycle. 
The recurring continued fraction 1 + 2~ 3~ 4~ 3~ 4~ • • • is denoted by
