Preface
The text is intended to form a bridge between calculus and analysis. It is based
on the author's lecture notes, notes used and revised nearly every year over the last
decade or so. The students typically were a mixture of students intending to go on to
graduate work in mathematics and students intending to teach mathematics in grades
9-12. The later students typically only take the ﬁrst semester of the two semester
sequence. In order to cover the material, the prospective teachers might need to
teach one variable calculus in high school; the text is designed to comfortably allow
coverage of the standard calculus topics including the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus in the ﬁrst semester. The material needed to prepare the remaining students
for a graduate level Real Analysis course can comfortably be covered in the second
semester.
To learn something new, for example, some mathematical topic or a foreign lan-
guage, requires exposure to many examples, practice, and the passage of time. To
quote one of the famous mathematicians of the twentieth century:
"... in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them." - John Von
Neumann
Hence, to help the reader learn from the text, the text includes many examples and
a variety of interesting applications are included, several dealing with surprising
properties of irrational numbers. The applications include some of the "jewels" of
analysis, for example, e is transcendental, π is irrational, a space ﬁlling curve, and
examples of nowhere differentiable continuous functions. Many of the applications
are not standard, but of interest to the students. There are exercises embedded in the
text and problem sections at the end of each chapter. The exercises in the text are in-
tended to slow the reader down and allow immediate engagement with some aspect
of the material being discussed. Essential ideas related to limits and continuity are
treated early and revisited in greater depth later. Topics are broken into small easily
digestible modules containing detailed explanations. Brief biographical material is
included for many of the mathematicians who contributed to the development of the
subject.
The text is basically a one variable treatment, in many places this variable is a
complex variable. Using a complex variables (i) places emphasis on the triangle
inequality, hence aids in the transition to more advanced analysis courses, (ii) keeps
the level of abstraction at the same level as the standard one variable treatment, and
(iii) some two (real) variable topics are easily accessible.

Introduction
We deﬁne the set of real numbers to be the set of inﬁnite decimals. Apart from
leaving the arithmetic of inﬁnite decimals as a mystery, we attempt an axiomatic
approach to the subject.
The chapters are intended to be read in the order in which they are presented.
Chap. 13 on topology is special, and could perhaps be regarded as an appendix.
Most of Chap. 13 can be covered at the same time as Chap. 5. It could also be
covered instead of parts of that chapter. The subsection on sequential compactness in
Sect. 13.3, requires Sect. 9.1. The appendices contain various kinds of background
material. The author has found it useful for students to begin with Appendix D. In
addition to reinforcing the rules for working with inequalities, this gets the students
used to proving things they already "know." Since most students have taken calculus
prior to taking this course that is in itself useful, this appendix also introduces the
students to do work based on a set of axioms.
Some sections are marked with a star. This does not indicate they are less im-
portant or more difﬁcult than other section. It only signiﬁes that they are not used
elsewhere in the text. Some of these sections contain the most "interesting" results in
this text. Several of the starred sections involve investigating properties of irrational
and transcendental numbers. Among these are proofs that e and π are irrational as
well as the explicit construction of some transcendental numbers.
Except in a few clearly labeled places, we do not use functions whose existence
we have not established. We establish the existence of roots, logarithms, exponen-
tials, and the trigonometric functions using the methods of analysis.
The ideas in some proofs reoccur multiple times. In fact, some proofs have been
chosen speciﬁcally for this reason. Examples include the proof that a number is a
root of a polynomial if and only if there is a corresponding linear factor and the proof
that the square root of two is irrational. Consequently, some of the proofs in the text
are deliberately not the most elegant proof of the statement under consideration.
The early parts of the text uses formal notation. Writing a statement in this man-
ner indicates what must be done to prove this statement and in which order this must
be done. Using formal notation also makes it clear how a statement can be used in a
proof. Hence, using formal notation aids the beginning analysis student understand
and construct proofs. In places, the formality is relaxed to help the student transition
to the standard writing style used in many mathematics books.

Introduction
Many results in the text are credited to one or two persons, in many (most?) cases
this is misleading. Most likely the result was know to earlier mathematicians in
some form or other. Dates in the text may only be approximate. At least the author
found contradictory information in several instances. Despite these shortcomings,
mentioning names and dates serves to illustrate that analysis was developed by many
people over a long period of time.
Note to the Student Reader
Working the exercises embedded in the text is intended to help you assimilate the
material. Working these exercises without assistance of any kind, for example, from
friends, other books, or the internet is necessary in order to gain a basic understand-
ing of the subject. Each chapter contains a section of solutions and hints that can
be consulted after a signiﬁcant amount of time has been spent attempting to ﬁnd a
solution. Once you have written down a complete solution to an exercise, it is useful
to compare this solution to other solutions. This is where friends, other books, and
the Internet are useful.
Each chapter also contains a selection of problems. Working these problems will
give the reader additional practice with the concepts and tools developed in the text.
The results established in these problems are not used elsewhere.
When solving exercises and problems try only to rely on the deﬁnition and the
major theorems: the named theorems. Try not to use the various minor results con-
tained in un-named theorems, lemmas, and exercises. When solving exercises and
problems do not refer to other problems in the text. An exception to rule is that some
problems are part of a sequence of problems leading to up to a major conclusion.
Some easy exercises are stated because they are useful when proving some of the
more interesting statements. Claims stated without proofs as well as all claims made
in exercises/problems are meant to be proven by the reader.
When reading a proof (including your own proofs/solutions) you need to be able
to: (a) explain why the proof proves the theorem/problem, (b) identify the main
steps in the proof, (often they take the form of smaller claims made in the proof) (c)
ﬁll in all missing details (go through the proof line by line to check the details), (d)
identify where each hypothesis in the theorem is used.

Part I

Calculus
The theory of differential and integral calculus is the main focus of this part.
This includes discussions of number, sets of numbers, limits, continuity, derivative,
and Riemann integral. Applications includes a proof of the Steinhaus three distance
conjecture, Liouville's theorem on transcendental numbers, convex function theory,
a construction of the exponential and logarithmic functions, an example of a com-
pactly supported smooth function, and a proof that the number e is transcendental.

Chapter 1
Limits
The set real numbers is deﬁned as the set of inﬁnite decimals. Density of the set of
rational numbers and of the set of irrational numbers in the set of real numbers is
established. This naturally leads to a discussion of accumulation points that serves
as a precursor for the main part of this chapter: the theory of limits of functions.
Convergence of sequences and series of numbers are discussed brieﬂy. A bounded
function, the Dirichlet function, that does not have a limit at any real number is
presented. Section 1.8 contains a proof of Steinhaus' three distance conjecture.
1.1 Inﬁnite Decimals
The basis set underlying all of our considerations is the set of all real numbers, that
is, the set of all inﬁnite decimals. In this section we investigate a few basic properties
of inﬁnite decimals. We begin by introducing some terminology.
An inﬁnite decimal is an expression of the form
±d0.d1d2 ··· ,
where d0 ∈N0, and for k ≥1, dk is a decimal digit meaning
dk ∈{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
For example, if our inﬁnite decimal is 13.23674··· , then d0 = 13, d1 = 2, d2 = 3,
d3 = 6, d4 = 7, etc.
An inﬁnite decimal
±d0.d1d2 ···
is repeating, if there are k,m ∈N, such that dj+m = dj for all j ≥k. The digits
dkdk+1 ···dk+m−1 are the repeating part of the inﬁnite decimal and the repeating

part has length m. We will write
d0.d1d2 ···dk−1dkdk+1 ···dk+m−1 := d0.d1d2 ··· .
For example, 1.67234523452345··· = 1.672345 is an inﬁnite decimal with repeat-
ing part 2345 of length 4. Another example of a repeating decimal is 0 = 0.0. More
generally, we will say that decimals of the form 2.453 := 2.4530 are ﬁnite decimals.
We assume the reader is familiar with the usual properties of addition and multi-
plication, including the associative, commutative, and distributive properties. These
properties are, for example, encoded in the ﬁeld axioms. Inequality between two in-
ﬁnite decimals has the usual meaning, in particular, inequality satisﬁes the Axioms
of Trichotomy and Positive Closure. Consequently, we can freely use the conse-
quences of these axioms derived in Sects. D.1 and D.2.
Finite Decimals
Let x := 0.9, then 10x = 9.9 = 9+x, hence 9x = 9, so x = 1. That is
0.999··· = 0.9 = 1.
Similarly, any inﬁnite decimal terminating in 9 equals a ﬁnite decimal. Con-
versely, any ﬁnite decimal equals an inﬁnite decimal terminating in 9. For example,
1.239 = 1.24. We have shown:
Theorem 1.1.1. The set of ﬁnite decimals equals the set of inﬁnite decimals termi-
nating in repeating nines.
Repeating Decimals
The set of rational numbers is
Q :=
	 p
q | p ∈Z,q ∈N

.
We provide a characterization of the rationals in terms of decimals.
The number 0.234 is rational. In fact, if x := 0.234, then 1000x = 234+x, hence
x = 234/999. Similarly, any repeating decimal is a rational number.
Calculating the decimal form of 1/7 by long division, there are at most 7 dif-
ferent remainders, namely 0,1,2,3,4,5, and 6. Hence, after at most 7 divisions, the
division problem repeats itself. Thus the inﬁnite decimal form of 1/7 is a repeating
decimal whose repeating part has length at most 6 (If the remainder is zero, the pro-
cess stops). Similarly, the repeating decimal form of any rational p/q, with 1 < q,
is a repeating decimal whose repeating part has length at most q−1.

1.1 Inﬁnite Decimals
5
We have shown:
Theorem 1.1.2. An inﬁnite decimal is a rational number iff it is repeating.
Example 1.1.3. By long division 1
3 = 0.3, and 2
3 = 0.6. Since 1
3 + 2
3 = 1
1 and 3
1
1
3 = 1
1
we have
0.3+0.6 = 1 and
3·0.3 = 1.
Leading to two further veriﬁcations that 0.9 = 1.
A real number that is not rational is called irrational. Irrational numbers exist be-
cause non-repeating decimals exist. For example, the inﬁnite decimal
0.1010010001···
(1.1)
(keep increasing the number of zeros) is non-repeating, hence an irrational number.
We will prove that
√
2, e, and π exist and are irrational. For
√
2 existence is
contained in Theorem 3.5.1 and irrationality is established by Theorem 3.5.4. We
construct e in Sect. 8.2 and show e is irrational (even transcendental) in Sect. 8.3. In
Sect. 11.2 we construct π and in Sect. 11.5 we show π is irrational.
Density
Let A and B be two sets. We say A is dense in B, if any ball centered at a point in B
must contain at least one point from A. In symbols,
∀b ∈B,∀r > 0,A∩Br(b) ̸= /0.
Alternatively, using the deﬁnition of an open ball, we can rewrite the deﬁnition of A
being dense in B as
∀b ∈B,∀r > 0,∃a ∈A,|a−b| < r.
Usually, when we say A is dense in B, the set A is a subset of the set B, but this is
not required by the deﬁnition.
Lemma 1.1.4. If r > 0, then there is an integer N ≥1, such that r > 1/10N.
Proof. Let r = d0.d1d2 ··· be the inﬁnite decimal representation of r. Since r ̸= 0,
for at least one n, dn is non-zero. Consequently, r > 1/10n+1.

A direct consequence of this result is that there is no inﬁnitely small positive real
number:
Corollary 1.1.5. If 0 ≤r and r < 1/10n for all integers n, then r = 0.

The following theorems establish the density of the set of rational numbers and of
the set of irrational numbers in the set of all real numbers.
Theorem 1.1.6 (Density of Rationals). The set of all rational numbers is dense in
the set of all real numbers.
Proof. Let real number x and r > 0 be given. We must show that Br(x) contains at
least one rational number. Suppose x > 0. Let x = d0.d1d2 ··· be an inﬁnite decimal
representation of x. Let N ≥1 be an integer such that r > 1/10N. Let y := d0.d1 ···dN
and z := d0.d1 ···dN9 = y+1/10N. Then y and z are rationals.
Since y is obtained from x = d0.d1d2 ··· by replacing the dk with k > N by 0's
and z is obtained from x by replacing the dk with k > N by 9 's we have
y ≤x ≤z, and z = y+
1
10N .
(1.2)
Hence,
x ≤z = y+
1
10N ≤x+
1
10N < x+r.
Where the last inequality follows from the choice of N. Consequently, z is a rational
in Br(x).
The case where x < 0 is similar. If x = 0, then x is already a rational in Br(x).

Exercise 1.1.7. If r ̸= 0 is rational and x is irrational, then 1/x, x/r, rx and r +x are
irrational.
Theorem 1.1.8 (Density of Irrationals). Any open interval contains an irrational
number.
Proof. Let real numbers x and r > 0 be given. We will show that Br(x) contains at
least one irrational number. Let t be the irrational in (1.1). Then 0 < t < 1. Suppose
x > 0. Let x = d0.d1d2 ··· be an inﬁnite decimal representation of x. Let N ≥1 be
an integer such that r > 1/10N. Then
y := d0.d1 ···dN +
t
10N
is an irrational such that |x−y| ≤
1
10N < r.
The case x < 0 is similar. If x = 0, then t/10N is an irrational in Br(x).

1.2 Accumulation Points
Let D be a subset of C and let a be some complex number. We say a is an accumu-
lation point of D, if there are points in D\{a} arbitrarily close to a. Hence, a point
a is an accumulation point of D, if given any distance ε > 0, there is at least one
point in D\{a} whose distance to a is less than ε. We restate this as:

1.2 Accumulation Points
7
Deﬁnition 1.2.1. Let D be a subset of C and let a be some complex number. We
say a is an accumulation point of D, if for all ε > 0, there is an x ∈D, such that
0 < |x−a| < ε. In symbols,
∀ε > 0,∃x ∈D,0 < |x−a| < ε.
Accumulation points are also called limits points.
A ball without its center is called a punctured ball; hence a punctured ball is a set of
the form
B′
r(c) := Br(c)\{c} = {z ∈C | 0 < |z−c| < r}.
A punctured ball is also called a punctured neighborhood of c. In the same manner
the open ball Br(a) is sometimes called a neighborhood of a.
In terms of balls, we can rewrite the deﬁnition of an accumulation point as
∀ε > 0,B′
ε(a)∩D ̸= /0.
(1.3)
The following exercise shows that it is sufﬁcient to consider small values of ε > 0.
Exercise 1.2.2. Let m > 0 be given. If for all 0 < r ≤m, D∩B′
r(c) ̸= /0, then c is an
accumulation point of D.
Example 1.2.3. The number 0 is an accumulation point of B1(0).
Proof. To see this consider an arbitrary ε > 0. We may assume ε ≤1. Let x := ε/2.
Then 0 < x = |x−0| < 1 (so x ∈B1(0),) and 0 < |x−0| < ε. See Fig. 1.1.

Example 1.2.4. The number 1 is an accumulation point of B1(0).
Proof. To see this, consider ε > 0. We may assume ε ≤1. Then 0 < ε/2 ≤1/2.
Hence, 0 < 1
2 ≤1 −ε
2 < 1. Consequently, if x := 1 −ε
2, then 0 < x < 1. Thus x ∈
B1(0) and 0 < |x−1| < ε, as we needed to show. See Fig. 1.2.

1.3 Limits of Functions
Understanding the deﬁnition of limits is central to understanding a modern devel-
opment of calculus. The modern concept of limits is highly nontrivial: It took math-
ematicians several hundred years, after the discovery of calculus, to organize the
logical development of calculus around the concept of the limits and another hun-
dred years or so to write down the modern (precise) deﬁnition of the limit.
Deﬁnition of Limits
If A and B are sets, then the notation f : A →B is used to indicate that f is deﬁned
on all of A and has values in B. If every element of B is a value of f, then f is said
to be onto or surjective. See Sect. A.4 for more background information regarding
functions.
Let D be a subset of C. Let function f : D →C and suppose a ∈C is an accumu-
lation point of D. Let L ∈C. We would like to turn the vague statement
f(x) is close to L, when x is close to a
into a precise mathematical statement, that is, into a statement that can be described
using set theory and logic. As a step in this direction we reformulate the previous
vague statement as:
we can arrange that f(x) is as close to L, as we wish,
for all x sufﬁciently close to a
The ﬁrst part "that f(x) is as close to L, as we wish" can be made precise as follows:
for any (small) ε > 0,|f(x)−L| < ε.
The second part "for all x sufﬁciently close to a" can be made precise by saying that
0 < |x−a| < δ for some δ > 0 depending on ε,
where 0 < |x−a| < δ says x is close to a and "sufﬁciently" is encoded in the de-
pendence of δ on ε. We want a to be an accumulation point of D, because that guar-
antees that D ∩B′
δ(a) is nonempty, that is, 0 < |x −a| < δ for at least one x ∈D.
Hence we have arrived at:
Deﬁnition 1.3.1. Let D ⊆C, a,L ∈C, and f : D →C. If a is an accumulation point
of D, we will say that f(x) converges to L as x goes to a provided: Given any ε > 0,
there is a δ > 0, such that for any x ∈D with 0 < |x−a| < δ, we have |f(x)−L| < ε.

1 Limits
In symbols,
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀x ∈D,0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)−L| < ε.
(1.4)
This deﬁnition of limit is due to Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass (31 October
1815 Ostenfeldeto 19 February 1897 Berlin). Using neighborhoods, as in Sect. 1.2,
Eq. (1.4) can be written as
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀x ∈D,x ∈B′
δ(a) =⇒f(x) ∈Bε(L).
(1.5)
If g : A →B and C ⊆A, then g(C) := {g(x) | x ∈C} is the image of C. Clearly,
g(A) ⊆B. Note that g is onto, if g(A) = B. Using this image notation we can write
(1.5) and therefore (1.4) as
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0, f(D∩B′
δ(a)) ⊆Bε(L).
(1.6)
Restating (1.6) in words: Given a ball B centered at L, there is a punctured ball B′
centered at a, such that f maps B′ into B.
We will abbreviate Eq. (1.4) as
lim
x→a f(x) = L
and say that L is the limit of f as x goes to a. Using notation that is similar to saying
that f(x) goes to L as x goes to a, we will also abbreviate (1.4), and therefore also
the equivalent formulations (1.5) and (1.6), as
f(x) →L, as x →a
and as
f(x)−→
x→aL.
Model
Nothing moves in the deﬁnition of convergence. Hence, notation using
arrows to describe convergence is somewhat deceptive. Here we discuss a more
appropriate model of limx→a f(x) = L.
Preamble
The model below is chosen because traditionally, at least in Europe
during times of war, mathematicians were employed calculating ballistic or-
bits, sometimes even on the battleﬁeld.
Set-up
Suppose we have a canon. When this canon is ﬁred at an angle x to
the horizon the projectile lands a distance f(x) from the canon. The intended
target is a distance L from the canon and a is an angle such that f(a) = L. In
practice, it is not possible to set up the canon in such a way that the angle x
is determined with absolute precision, i.e., such that x = a. However, we only
need the projectile to land so close to the target that the target is destroyed.
We call this the target tolerance.
Discussion
The function f(x) encodes a lot of information, e.g., how far the
target is above (or below) the canon (or more complicated information about
the terrain), wind speed, atmospheric pressure, etc. How close to the target

1.3 Limits of Functions
11
we need the projectile to land depends on how well the target is fortiﬁed.
Considering both the angle to the horizon x and the direction y in which the
canon is ﬁred, leads to a problem where f(x + iy) is a function mapping the
plane into the plane—into the plane because the projectile can land left or
right of the target as well as in front of or behind the target.
Problem
Given a target, set up the canon such that the target is destroyed.
Solution
For any target tolerance, there is an angle tolerance, such that, if the
angle adjustment of the canon falls within the angle tolerance, then the projec-
tile will land within the target tolerance. Using the symbols a,x,L, and f(x)
we restate this as: Given any target tolerance ε > 0, there is an angle tolerance
δ > 0, such that, if 0 < |x−a| < δ, then |f(x)−L| < ε. See Table 1.1.
Ballistic model

∀ε > 0

Table 1.1 Comparison of the ballistic model to the deﬁnition (1.4) of the limit of a function
Remark
The condition 0 < |x−a| in Table 1.1 corresponds to the fact that it is
not possible to adjust the angle of the canon with absolute precision.
End-of-Model
It is a consequence of Exercise 1.2.2 that when working with limits only "small"
values of ε > 0 and δ > 0 need to be considered. This is illustrated in the following
two remarks. We give the arguments both in terms of (1.4) and in terms of (1.6).
Remark 1.3.2. If we can ﬁnd a δ corresponding to ε = 1/2, then that δ also works
for ε = 1. Simply
0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)−b| < 1
2 =⇒| f(x)−b| < 1
by transitivity of inequality. In terms of ball, if f(B′
δ(a)) ⊆B1/2(b), then f(B′
δ(a)) ⊆
B1(b), because B1/2(b) ⊆B1(b).
Thus, when trying to verify (1.4), it is sufﬁcient to consider small values of ε.
That is, if it is convenient to assume, for example, ε < 1/3, you can safely do so.
Remark 1.3.3. Suppose δ = 1 works for some value of ε, then δ = 1/2 also works
for that value of ε. Again, this is by transitivity of inequalities:
0 < |x−a| < 1
2 =⇒0 < |x−a| < 1 =⇒| f(x)−b| < ε.

12

In terms of ball, if f (B′


B′
1/2(a)

⊆Bε(b), because B′
1/2(a) ⊆
B′
1(a).
Since we only need to ﬁnd one value of δ, this means that, if it is convenient
to assume, for example, δ < 1/3, we can safely do so. We are not looking for the
"best" or largest δ, or trying to classify all the possible δ's that might work.
The arguments in Remarks 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 show that we can replace 0 < |x−a| < δ
by 0 < |x −a| ≤δ and/or |f(x) −L| < ε by |f(x) −L| ≤ε, if convenient. That is,
we can use closed balls in place of open balls, or a mixture of open and closed balls,
whenever it is convenient.
Simple, but important, limits are established in the following two examples.
Example 1.3.4. Let a,k ∈C. If f(x) := k for all x ∈C, then f(x) →k as x →a.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Let δ := 1. Then 0 < |x−a| < δ = 1, implies |f(x)−k| =
|k −k| = 0 < ε. Hence, δ = 1 works for any ε.

Example 1.3.5. Let a ∈C. If f(x) := x for all x ∈C, then f(x) →a as x →a.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Let δ := ε, then δ > 0 and
0 ≤|x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)−a| = |x−a| < δ = ε.
Hence, δ = ε works.

In order to analyze more interesting examples we need some techniques. Using
(1.6) is often intuitive, since it allows us a pictorial argument. (The reader may
want to illustrate Remarks 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 using drawings of appropriate balls.)
However, in concrete cases (1.4) is often more useful because it allows us to "solve"
|f(x)−L| < ε for δ. This is illustrated in the examples below.
Example 1.3.6. Let f : C →C be determined by f(x) := 3x −5. Then f(x) →7 as
x →4.
Proof. To prove this, let ε > 0 be given. We need to ﬁnd a δ > 0, such that |f(x)−
7| < ε, when 0 < |x−4| < δ. A useful algebraic manipulation is
|f(x)−7| = |3x−12| = 3|x−4|
(1.7)
since this displays |x−4| as a factor of |f(x)−7|. The choice of δ will control the
size of |x−4|. Our goal
|f(x)−7| < ε
takes the form
3|x−4| < ε.
Dividing by 3, gives
|x−4| < ε
3.

1.3 Limits of Functions
13
So, let δ := ε/3. Then δ > 0 since ε > 0. Having constructed a δ, we must verify
that it works. Using (1.7) it follows that
|x−4| < δ =⇒3|x−4| < 3δ =⇒| f(x)−7| < 3ε
3 = ε.
Thus δ = ε/3 works.

Having constructed δ, one should in principle verify that it works, as we did
above. This step is often left for the reader.
Example 1.3.7. Let f : C →C be determined by f(x) := x2. Then f(x) →9 as x →3.
Proof. To prove this, let ε > 0 be given. We need to ﬁnd a δ > 0, such that |f(x)−
9| < ε, when 0 < |x−3| < δ. A useful algebraic manipulation is
|f(x)−9| = |x+3||x−3|
(1.8)
since this displays |x−3| as a factor of |f(x)−9|. The choice of δ will control the
size of |x −3|, but before we can choose δ, we need to control the size of |x + 3|.
Since we want x to be close to 3, we can restrict our deliberations to |x−3| < 1 and
see what that says about |x+3|. By the triangle inequality
|x+3| = |x−3+6| ≤|x−3|+|6| < 1+6 = 7
when |x−3| < 1. Hence, using (1.8)
|x−3| < 1 =⇒| f(x)−9| ≤7|x−3|.
The last inequality suggests we want 7|x−3| < ε. In fact, if |x−3| < 1 and |x−3| <
ε/7, then
|f(x)−9| ≤7|x−3| < 7ε
4 = ε.
Thus δ := min{1,ε/7} works.

The choice of the 1 in |x−3| < 1 above, was arbitrary. Replacing that 1 by any other
positive number would work in this example.
The proof above could be written using neighborhood notation, to summarize:
x ∈B1(3) =⇒|x+3| < 7 and
x ∈Bε/7(3) =⇒|x−3| < ε/7 hence
x ∈B1(3)∩Bε/7(3) =⇒|x+3||x−3| < 7(ε/7).
The assignment δ := min{1,ε/7} then results from
B1(3)∩Bε/7(3) = Bmin{1,ε/7}(3).
Example 1.3.8. Let f : C\{0} →C be determined by f(x) := 1
x. Then f(x) →2 as
x →1

Example 1.3.10 (Pseudo-sine Function). We have not yet constructed the trigono-
metric functions. This example introduces a function that roughly behaves like the
sine function. Let
f(x) :=

4x(1−x)

4x(1+x)
when −1 ≤x ≤0
Note f is an odd function: f(−x) = −f(x). Extend f to all of R as a periodic func-
tion σ with period 2 :
σ(x+2n) := f(x), when x ∈[−1,1] and n ∈Z.
σ is well-deﬁned because f(−1) = f(1).
The graph of σ roughly looks like the sine function, more precisely, roughly like
the graph of sin(πx), see Fig. 1.4. We call σ the pseudo-sine function. The sine
function is constructed in Sect. 11.2.

Some Consequences of the Existence of a Limit
The results in this subsection may appear simple. But they are very useful when we
want to use the existence of some limit(s) to establish the existence of related limits.
They also serve to give us some experience using the assumption f(x) →L as x →a
in proofs.
In the following D is some subset of C and a is an accumulation point of D.
We say f : D →C has a property P near a, if there is a δ > 0, such that f(x)
satisﬁes P for all x in D∩B′
δ(a). If f has a limit at a, then f is bounded near a. More
precisely:
Theorem 1.3.12 (Local Boundedness). Let f : D →C. If limx→a f(x) exists, then
there is a δ > 0 and an M > 0, such that for all x ∈D, 0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)| ≤
M.
Proof. Suppose f(x) →L as x →a. Let ε := 1. Since f(x) →L as x →a, there is a
δ > 0, such that for all x ∈D, 0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)−L| < 1. Hence, for x ∈D
with 0 < |x−a| < δ, we have
|f(x)| ≤| f(x)−L|+|L| < 1+|L|.

Thus M = 1+|L| works (Fig. 1.6).

2, then f is deﬁned

M > 0 be given. Then
f

= M +2 > M
and 1/(M +2) < 1/2. In particular, we must choose M, i.e., ε, before we can deter-
mine δ. This is what we did in the proof of Theorem 1.3.12, and it corresponds to
the structure of our deﬁnition (1.4) of limits.
If a real valued function has a positive limit as x →a, then the function is positive
near a. More precisely:
Theorem 1.3.14 (Local Positivity). If f : D →R is a function such that f(x) →L
as x →a and L > 0, then there is a δ > 0, such that for all x ∈D, 0 < |x −a| < δ
=⇒L
2 < f(x).
Proof. Let ε := L/2. Then ε > 0 since L > 0. Since f(x) →L as x →a, there is a
δ > 0, such that for all x ∈D, 0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒|f(x)−L| < ε = L/2. For x ∈D,
with 0 < |x−a| < δ we have
f(x) = L−(L−f(x))

Exercise 1.3.15. If f : D →C, f(x) →L as x →a, and L ̸= 0, then there is a δ > 0,
such that for all x ∈D, 0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒|L|
2 < | f(x)|.
1.4 Calculating with Limits
The following allows us to perform basic algebra with limits. All the ideas needed
for the proofs are present in the examples above.
Theorem 1.4.1 (Linearity). Let D be a subset of C, f,g : D →C, and x0,a,b,L,M ∈
C. Suppose x0 is an accumulation point of D. If
f(x) →L and g(x) →M as x →x0,
then
(af +bg)(x) →aL+bM as x →x0.
Here (af +bg)(x) := af(x)+bg(x) for x ∈D.
Linearity is a direct consequence of the constant multiple and sum rules below.
Lemma 1.4.2 (Constant Multiple Rule). Let D be a subset of C, f : D →C, and
a,k,L ∈C. If a is an accumulation point of D and f(x) →L as x →a, then (k f)(x) →
kL as x →a.

18
1 Limits
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. The proof is based on the equality
|(k f)(x)−kL| = |k|| f(x)−L|.
Suppose k ̸= 0. Since ε/|k| > 0 and f(x)−→
x→aL, there is a δ > 0, such that, if x ∈D,
then 0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒|f(x)−L| < ε/|k|. Multiplying the last inequality by |k|
yields, 0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒|k f(x)−kL| < ε. Thus (k f)(x) −→
x→a kL.

Example 1.4.3. If a := 5, k := 3 and f(x) := x, we get 3x →3·5 = 15 as x →5.
Lemma 1.4.4 (Sum Rule). Let D be a subset of C and a,L,M ∈C. Suppose f,g :
D →C, a is an accumulation point of D, f(x) →L as x →a, and g(x) →M as
x →a, then ( f +g)(x) →L+M as x →a.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. The proof is based on the triangle inequality
|( f +g)(x)−(L+M)| ≤| f(x)−L|+|g(x)−M|.
Since f(x)−→
x→aL, there is a δ1 > 0, such that, if x ∈D, then x ∈B′
δ1(a) =⇒| f(x)−
L| < ε/2. Similarly, since g(x)−→
x→aM, there is a δ2 > 0, such that, if x ∈D, then
x ∈B′
δ2(a) =⇒|g(x)−M| < ε/2. Hence, x ∈B′
δ1(a)∩B′
δ2(a) implies |( f +g)(x)−
(L+M)| < ε/2+ε/2. Thus δ := min{δ1,δ2} works.

Example 1.4.5. If a = 5, f(x) := 7 and g(x) := x, we get 7 + x →7 + 5 = 12 as
x →5.
Theorem 1.4.6 (Product Rule). Let D be a subset of C and let a,L,M ∈C. Suppose
f,g : D →C and a is an accumulation point of D. If
f(x) →L and g(x) →M as x →a,
then
(fg)(x) →LM as x →a.
Here ( fg)(x) := f(x)g(x).
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. The proof is based on the triangle inequality
|( fg)(x)−LM| = |f(x)g(x)−Lg(x)+Lg(x)−LM|
≤|f(x)−L||g(x)|+|L||g(x)−M|.
By Local Boundedness (Theorem 1.3.12) there is a constant K > 0 and a δ1 > 0,
such that |g(x| ≤K, when 0 < |x−a| < δ1. Hence
|( fg)(x)−LM| ≤K |f(x)−L|+|L||g(x)−M|
when 0 < |x−a| < δ1.

1.4 Calculating with Limits
19
Using f(x) →L, and g(x) →M as x →a, we conclude there are δ2 > 0 and
δ3 > 0 such that
|f(x)−L| < ε
2K when 0 < |x−a| < δ2
|g(x)−M| <
ε
2|L|+1 when 0 < |x−a| < δ3
The +1 is there in case L = 0. Consequently, if 0 < |x −a| < min{δ1,δ2,δ3}, then
the last three inequalities displayed above all hold. Plugging the last two of these
into the ﬁrst gives us
|( fg)(x)−LM| < K ε
2K +|L|
ε
2|L|+1 < ε.
Thus, δ := min{δ1,δ2,δ3} works.

Exercise 1.4.7. Let n ∈N and a ∈C. Show that xn →an as x →a.
A polynomial is a function p : C →C of the form
p(x) = a0 +a1x+a2x2 +···+anxn
for some n ∈N0 and some complex numbers ak, k = 0,1,...,n. The degree of p is
the largest subscript k such that ak ̸= 0.
Exercise 1.4.8. If a ∈C and p is a polynomial, then p(x) →p(a) as x →a.
Theorem 1.4.9 (Quotient Rule). Let D be a subset of C. Suppose f,g : D →C, and
a,L,M ∈C. Let a be an accumulation point of D. If M ̸= 0 and
f(x) →L and g(x) →M as x →a,
then
f
g (x) →L
M as x →a.
Here f
g(x) := f(x)
g(x) for x ∈D.
Proof. We showed in Exercise 1.3.15 above that |g(x)| > |M|/2 for all x ∈D near
a. In particular, g(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈D near a. Consequently, f(x)/g(x) makes sense
near a.

Exercise 1.4.10. Complete the proof of the Quotient Rule.

The derivation of the inequalities that form the basis for the proofs of the rules
above are all based on the desire to ﬁnd expressions we know something about,
for example, in the proof of the quotient rule we began by looking for the factor
|f(x)−L| and then we "found" the factor |g(x)−M|.
A rational function is the ratio of two polynomials,
f(x) := p(x)
q(x)
where p and q are polynomial functions. If q(a) ̸= 0, then the quotient rule shows
that
p(x)
q(x) →p(a)
q(a) as x →a.
Actually, this requires that a is an accumulation point of {x ∈C | q(x) ̸= 0}. But,
this is true because, the set of roots {x ∈C | q(x) = 0} is ﬁnite:
Proposition 1.4.11. If p is a polynomial of degree n, then p has at most n roots.
This is part of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The full version of the Funda-
mental Theorem of Algebra is established in Sect. 9.4. We precede the proof by two
lemmas. The idea of the proof of the ﬁrst lemma is used at several points in the text.
Lemma 1.4.12. If p is a polynomial of degree n and z0 is a constant, then q(z) :=
p(z+z0) is a polynomial of degree n.
Proof. Write p(z) = ∑n
k=0 akzk. Then
q(z) := p(z+z0) =
n
∑
k=0
ak(z+z0)k,
where an ̸= 0. Expanding each (z + z0)k completes the proof. We include one ver-
sion of the details below. Simply expanding everything using the Binomial Theorem
and collection the coefﬁcients to the powers of z is an alternative way to ﬁnish the
argument
Expanding (z+z0)k, we see rk(z) := (z+z0)k is a polynomial of degree k. Since
the sum of two polynomials of degree ≤m is a polynomial of degree ≤m, we
conclude
q(z) =
n
∑
k=0
akrk(z) = anrn(z)+
n−1
∑
k=0
akrk(z)
is a polynomial of degree ≤n. The polynomial anrn(z) has degree n since rn has
degree n and an ̸= 0. And the polynomial ∑n−1
k=0 akrk(z) has degree ≤n−1, since it
is a sum of polynomials whose degrees all are ≤n−1. Consequently, the only term
in q(z) containing zn is the term in anrn(z).Thus q has degree n.

Lemma 1.4.13. If p is a polynomial of degree n + 1 and p(z0) = 0, then there is a
polynomial q of degree n, such that p(z) = (z−z0)q(z).
Proof. Suppose p is a polynomial of degree n+1 and p(z0) = 0. Let q(z) := p(z+
z0). By the ﬁrst lemma q is a polynomial of degree n + 1. Write q(z) = ∑n+1
k=0 bkzk.
Now
b0 = q(0) = p(0+z0) = 0.
Hence, z is a common factor of the terms in q(z) :
q(z) =
n+1
∑
k=0
bkzk =
n+1
∑
k=1
bkzk = z
n+1
∑
k=1
bkzk−1.
So, r(z) := ∑n+1
k=1 bkzk−1 is a polynomial of degree n and q(z) = zr(z). Finally,
p(z) = q(z−z0) = (z−z0)r(z−z0) = (z−z0)s(z),
where, s(z) := r(z −z0) = r(z + (−z0)) is a polynomial of degree n, by the ﬁrst
lemma.

We are now ready for the proof of Proposition 1.4.11.
Proof. Let Rp be the set of roots of the polynomial p. That is Rp = {z | p(z) = 0}.
We must show that if p has degree n, then Rp has at most n elements.
The proof is by induction on the degree of the polynomial. If p has degree one,
then p(x) = a+bx, where b ̸= 0. Hence, Rp = {−a/b}. This set has one element.
Let n ∈N. Suppose any polynomial of degree n has at most n roots. Let p be
some polynomial of degree n + 1. If Rp = /0, then we are done, since 0 ≤n + 1.
If Rp ̸= /0, let z0 ∈Rp. Then p(z0) = 0. Hence, by the second lemma, there is a
polynomial q of degree n, such that p(z) = (z −z0)q(z). Since p(z) = (z −z0)q(z)
we have Rp = {z0} ∪Rq. By the inductive hypothesis Rq has at most n elements,
hence Rp has at most n+1 elements.

Theorem 1.4.14 (Composition Rule). Let A,B, and C be subsets of C. Suppose
f : A →B, g : B →C, a is an accumulation point of A, b is an accumulation point
of B, and f(x) ̸= b when x ̸= a is close to a. If
f(x) →b as x →a and g(x) →c as x →b,
then
g◦f(x) →c as x →a.
Here, g◦f : A →C is determined by g◦f(x) := g( f(x)). And f(x) ̸= b when x ̸= a
is close to a, means that there is a γ > 0, such that ∀x ∈A, 0 < |x −a| < γ =⇒
f(x) ̸= b.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Since g(y) →c as y →b, there is a δ1 > 0 be such that
0 < |y−b| < δ1 =⇒|g(y)−c| < ε.

Since f(x) →b as x →a, there is a δ2 > 0 such that

position Rule can be used to show √1+x →2 as x →3.

Theorem 1.4.16 (Squeeze Rule). Let f,g,h : D →R. Suppose f(x) ≤g(x) ≤h(x)
for all x ̸= a near x0. If
f(x) →L and h(x) →L as x →x0,
then
g(x) →L as x →x0.
See Fig. 1.8
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Let δ f > 0 and δh > 0 be such that x ∈B′
δ f (a) implies
|f(x) −L| < ε and x ∈B′
δh(a) implies |h(x) −L| < ε. Let δ := min{δ f ,δh}. Then
x ∈B′
δ(a) implies x ∈B′
δ f (a) and x ∈B′
δh(a) hence −ε < f(x) −L < ε and −ε <
h(x)−L < ε. Hence, for x ∈B′
δ(a) we have
−ε < f(x)−L ≤g(x)−L ≤h(x)−L < ε.
Consequently, 0 < |x−a| < δ implies −ε < g(x)−L < ε. As we needed to show.

Example 1.4.17. Let f(x) :=
x
1+x2 be deﬁned on D := R. Then −|x| ≤f(x) ≤|x|.
Since |x| →0 as x →0, the Squeeze Rule implies
x
1+x2 →0 as x →0.
Restrictions
Let f be a function deﬁned on D. Sometimes it is useful to consider f on some subset
of its domain. This is called a restriction of f. If E ⊆D, we deﬁne the restriction of
f to E, to be the function f

E with domain E and having the same values as f on E.
Hence f

E(x) := f(x) for all x ∈E and f

E(x) is not deﬁned when x /∈E.
Exercise 1.4.18. Suppose D = D1 ∪D2.
(i)
If a is an accumulation point of D1 or of D2, then a is an accumulation
point of D.
(ii)
If a is an accumulation point of D, then a is an accumulation point of
D1 or of D2.
Theorem 1.4.19. Suppose D = D1 ∪D2. Let a be an accumulation point of D1 and
of D2. Let f : D →C be a function.
1. If f(x) →L as x →a, then f

D1(x) →L as x →a.
2. If f

D1(x) →L as x →a and f

D2(x) →L as x →a, then f(x) →L as x →a.
Proof. 1. Let ε > 0 be given. Let δ > 0 be such that
∀x ∈D,0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)−b| < ε.
For x ∈D1 we have x ∈D1 ∪D2 = D and
0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)−b| < ε
=⇒
f

D1(x)−b
 < ε −−since f

D1(x) = f(x).
Hence the δ that works for f also works for f

Let δ := min{δ1,δ2}. Let x ∈D with 0 < |x −a| < δ. Since D = D1 ∪D2 either
x ∈D1 or x ∈D2.
If x ∈D1, then
0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒0 < |x−a| < δ1 −−since δ ≤δ1

Dj(x), j = 1,2 both exists and are equal.
For a set A let
1A(x) :=

1
if x ∈A
0
if x /∈A .
The function 1A is called the characteristic function of A.
Example 1.4.21 (Dirichlet Function). Let f : R →R be the characteristic function
of the set of rational, f := 1Q. Let a be a real number. By density of the rationals
and of the irrationals a is an accumulation point of Q and of R\Q. Clearly,
lim
x→a f

Q(x) = lim
x→a1 = 1, and
lim
x→a f

R\Q(x) = lim
x→a0 = 0.
Since 0 ̸= 1, Corollary 1.4.20 with D1 := Q and D2 := R\Q, shows that f does not
have a limit at the point a. Since a was arbitrary, f does not have a limit at any point.
1.5 Variations on Limits
In this section D ⊆R. We consider one-sided limits, limits at inﬁnity, and inﬁnite
limits. The treatment is brief; most of the details are very similar to the ones for
"ordinary" limits.
One-Sided Limits
When considering the limit of √x at a = 0, we are necessarily only considering
positive values for x. This is an example of a one-sided limit. But the real interest in
one-sided limits is when f is deﬁned on both sides of a. When considering one-sided
limits, it is convenient to use one-sided neighborhoods
B+
r (a) := B′
r(a)∩]a,∞[= {x | a < x < a+r}
B−
r (a) := B′
r(a)∩]−∞,a[= {x | a−r < x < a}

1.5 Variations on Limits
25
Limits from above (from the right) are denoted by
lim
x↘a f(x) = b or f(x) →b as x ↘a
and means that, a is an accumulation point of D∩]a,∞[ and
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀x ∈D,x ∈B+
δ (a) =⇒| f(x)−a| < ε.
Sometimes x ↘a is written as x →a+. Limits from below (from the left) are deﬁned
in a similar manner. The reader will not experience any difﬁculty in transcribing the
results in Sects. 1.3 and 1.4 to the one-sided case. In fact, one-sided limits are really
the same as limits of restrictions. For example, the considering limx↘a f(x) is the
same as considering limx→a f

D∩]a,∞[(x).
Exercise 1.5.1. The two-sided limit of f exists at a iff both one-sided limits of f
exists at a and are equal.
Example 1.5.2. As an example of one-sided limits consider
f(x) := |x−2||x+2|
x−2
on D := {x ∈R | x ̸= 2}. This is an example where f is not deﬁned at the point of
interest, in this case at a = 2. Since
f(x) =

|x+2|
when 2 < x
−|x+2|
when x < 2
we have limx↘2 f(x) = 4 and limx↗2 f(x) = −4. Consequently, limx→2 f(x) does
not exist.
Limits at Inﬁnity
A limit at inﬁnity is essentially a kind of one-sided limit. In fact,
lim
x→∞f(x) = L or f(x) →L as x →∞
means that D contains arbitrarily large real numbers (roughly ∞is an accumulation
point of D, precisely, ∀N ∈R,∃x ∈D,N < x) and
∀ε > 0,∃N ∈R,∀x ∈D,N < x =⇒| f(x)−L| < ε.
That is, if we can arrange that f(x) is as close to L as we please, by choosing x
sufﬁciently large. Writing x ↗∞is consistent with writing x ↗a, but is redundant,

26
1 Limits
since there in only one way to approach ∞. Similarly,
lim
x→−∞f(x) = L or f(x) →L as x →−∞
means that D contains arbitrarily small real numbers and
∀ε > 0,∃N ∈R,∀x ∈D,x < N =⇒| f(x)−L| < ε.
Since the limits at inﬁnity are very similar to one-sided limits, the reader will not
experience any difﬁculty in transcribing the results in Sects. 1.3 and 1.4 to the cases
of limits at inﬁnity.
Example 1.5.3. 1
x2 →0 as x →∞.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. We want to ﬁnd N such that N < x =⇒1
x2 < ε. Rewriting
1
x2 < ε as
1
ε < x2
we see N :=
1
√ε does the job.

Exercise 1.5.4. Let n ∈N. Prove
lim
x→∞
1
xn = 0 and
lim
x→−∞
1
xn = 0.
Inﬁnite Limits
Suppose a is an accumulation point of D and f : D →R. We write
lim
x→a f(x) = ∞or f(x) →∞as x →a
if
∀N ∈R,∃δ > 0,∀x ∈D,0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒N < f(x).
Clearly, it is sufﬁcient to consider large N, e.g., N ≥1. In this case, we will not say
that f converges, rather we say f diverges to inﬁnite as x →a.
Exercise 1.5.5. If limx→a f(x) = ∞, then limx→a
1
f(x) = 0.
Similarly, we can deﬁne limx→a f(x) = −∞, as well as one-sided inﬁnite limits and
four variants involving inﬁnite limits at inﬁnity: limx→±∞f(x) = ±∞. For example,

1.5 Variations on Limits
27
limx→∞f (x) = ∞means D contains arbitrary large numbers and
∀N,∃M,∀x ∈D,x > M =⇒f (x) > N.
Appropriate versions of the rules for calculating with limits remain valid. Some
care is needed, in addition to 0/0, expressions of the forms 0 · ∞, ∞/∞, and ∞−∞
should be avoided. While others, for example ∞+∞= ∞, a+∞= ∞, 0/∞= 0, and
if a > 0, a∞= ∞are valid.
Example 1.5.6. We calculate the limits at inﬁnity of polynomials. Let p(z) := anzn +
an−1zn−1 + an−2zn−2 + ··· + a1z + a0 be a polynomial, suppose n ≥1 and an ̸= 0.
For z ̸= 0 we can rewrite p(z) as
p(z) = zn

Using limx→±∞1/xk = 0, shows that the expression in the parenthesis →an as

since the expression in the parenthesis →|an| as |z| →∞, we have |p(z)| →∞as
|z| →∞.
Example 1.5.7. The limits at inﬁnity of rational functions can be calculated in a
similar manner. For example, if
p(x) := amxm +am−1xm−1 +am−2xm−2 +···+a1x+a0
q(x) := bnxn +bn−1xn−1 +bn−2xn−2 +···+b1x+b0

1.6 Sequences
In this section we will consider the limit limx→∞f in the case D := N. Hence, es-
sentially this section is a special case limits at inﬁnity considered in Sect. 1.5. We
include some proofs here since we left the corresponding proofs to the reader in
Sect. 1.5.
A sequence of complex numbers is a function x : N →C. When working with
sequences we will usually write xn in place of x(n) and (xn) or (xn)∞
n=1 in place of
x, or x : N →C. The deﬁnition of a limit at inﬁnite specializes to: (xn) converges to
x, if given any ε > 0, there is a K, such that |xn −x| < ε for all n > K.
A sequence (xn) is bounded, if there is a K, such that |xn| ≤K for all n.
Example 1.6.1. The sequence (1+(−1)n) is bounded. For example, K = 2 and K =
17 both work.
Example 1.6.2. The sequence (n) is not bounded. Since, given any real number K
there are integers larger than K.
Convergence of Sequences
We establish local boundedness and positivity for sequences. Essentially, this is con-
tained in Sects. 1.3 and 1.5. We include proofs here for the readers convenience. The
following is Theorem 1.3.12 (local boundedness) specialized to sequences.
Theorem 1.6.3. A convergent sequence is bounded.
Proof. Suppose xn →x. Since ε := 1 > 0 there is an N such that n > N implies
|xn −x| < 1. Since
|xn| = |xn −x+x| ≤|xn −x|+|x| < 1+|x|
when n > N, K := max{|x1|,|x2|,...,|xN|,1} has the desired property.

Specializing the exercise after Theorem 1.3.14 (local positivity) to sequences
yields:
Theorem 1.6.4. Suppose xn →p and p ̸= 0. There is an N, such that n > N implies
|xn| > |p|/2.

1.6 Sequences
29
Proof. Since |p|/2 > 0, there is an N, such that n > N implies |xn −p| < |p|/2.
Since
|xn| = |p−(xn −p)| ≥|p|−|xn −p| > |p|/2
when n > N, we are done.

Theorem 1.3.14 itself specializes to:
Exercise 1.6.5. Suppose (xn) is a sequence of real numbers and xn →p. If p > 0,
show there is an N, such that n > N implies xn > p/2.
Having established the two basic properties of convergent sequences, we can repeat
the proofs about the algebra of limits of functions from Sect. 1.4 to establish:
Theorem 1.6.6. Suppose an →a, bn →b, and k ∈C. Then
1. kan →ka
2. an +bn →a+b
3. anbn →ab
4. an
bn →a
b, provided b ̸= 0
5. If an ≤bn ≤cn for all n, an →a and cn →a, then bn →a.
If (an) is a sequence of real numbers, then we will write an →∞, if given any real
number K, there is an N, such that, for any integer n, n > N =⇒an > K.
Similarly, we write an →−∞, if given any real number K, there is an N such that
for any integer n, n > N =⇒an < K.
As for limits of functions appropriate versions of the theorem above are valid for
inﬁnite limits. See Sect. 1.5.
Null Sequences
A sequence (xn) is null, if given any ε > 0, there is an N ∈N, such that for all n ∈N,
n > N =⇒|xn| < ε. Hence (xn) is null iff xn →0. Clearly, xn →x iff (xn −x) is
null.
Example 1.6.7. (1/n) is null.
Proof. Let ε > 0. Let N := ⌈1/ε⌉be the ceiling of 1/ε, that is the integer integer
satisfying N −1 < 1/ε ≤N. Then n > N implies
0 < 1
n < 1
N ≤ε.
Hence (1/n) is null.

Exercise 1.6.8. (1+(−1)n) is not null.
Theorem 1.6.9. If M ∈C and (xn) is null, then (Mxn) is null.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Since ε/(1+|M|) > 0 and (xn) is null there is an N, such
that n ≥N =⇒|xn| < ε/(1+|M|). Hence, n ≥N =⇒|Mxn| ≤(1+|M|)|xn| < ε.
Thus, (Mxn) is null.

1.7 Geometric Progression
An arithmetic progression is obtained by continually adding the same number, hence
a, a+b, a+2b, ... is a arithmetic progression. A geometric progression is obtained
by continually multiplying by the same number, hence a, ab, ab2, ab3,... is a ge-
ometric progression. Geometric progressions are also called geometric sequences.
Our ﬁrst result about geometric progressions states that a certain class of geo-
metric progressions are null sequences:
Theorem 1.7.1. Let x ∈R. Suppose 0 < x < 1. For any real number ε > 0, there is
an N ∈N, such that n ≥N =⇒xn ≤ε.

of t is the integer ⌊t⌋satisfying ⌊t⌋≤t < ⌊t⌋+1.]
Hence, if 0 < x < 1, then the sequence (xn) is null.
Corollary 1.7.3. Let z be a complex number such that |z| < 1. Then (zn) is null.
Proof. By the theorem |zn| = |z|n →0.

Example 1.7.4. Let x be a positive real number with inﬁnite decimal representation
x = d0.d1d2 ··· . If xn := d0.d1d2 ···dn is the corresponding sequence of ﬁnite deci-
mals, then xn →x.
Proof. Let ε > 0. Since (1/10n) is null we can pick an integer N such that 1/10N <
ε. Then
0 ≤x−xn = 0.0···0dn+1dn+2 ···
≤0.0···099··· = 1/10n.
Hence, if n ≥N, then |x−xn| ≤10−n ≤10−N < ε.

"subintervals". In this section it is shown that there are numbers a,b, and c such
that the length of any of these "subintervals" is one of these three numbers. This
was part of a group of conjectures Władysław Hugo Dionizy Steinhaus (14 January
1887 Jasło to 25 February 1972 Wrocław) made regarding the lengths of the inter-
vals generated by irrational rotations. The corresponding problem in the closed unit
interval [0,1] is solved in this section.
This section can be covered any time after Sect. 1.1.

The Problem
Let N be a positive integer and let φ be some positive irrational number. Pick m and
M in {1,...,N} such that
{mφ} ≤{jφ} ≤{Mφ} for all j ∈{1,...,N}.
Here {x} denotes the fractional part of the real number x.
For k = 0,1,...,N with k ̸= M let k′ ∈{0,...,N} be such that
{kφ} < {k′φ} and
{kφ} < {jφ} =⇒{k′φ} ≤{jφ} for all j ∈{1,...,N}.
Thus {k′φ} is the point "after" {kφ}. Clearly, 0′ = m. If we set M′ = 0, then k →k′
is a bijection of {0,...,N} onto itself. For irrational φ the points are dense in the
closed interval [0,1], see Sect. 12.6.
Theorem 1.8.1 (Steinhaus' Three Distance Conjecture). For any k = 0,...,N
with k ̸= M
{k′φ}−{kφ} ∈{{mφ},1−{Mφ},{mφ}+1−{Mφ}}.
That is, any one of the intervals [{kφ},{k′φ}], has length {mφ}, 1 −{Mφ}, or
{mφ}+1−{Mφ}.
This is also true for negative irrationals φ and for rational φ. For negative numbers,
the details depends to some extend on how the fractional part of a negative number
is determined. Is {−1.23} = −0.23? or is {−1.23} = 0.77? The latter corresponds
to the interpretation {x} := x −⌊x⌋, the former might seem more natural, just lop
off the stuff before the decimal point.
Exercise 1.8.2. If α is irrational and m ̸= n are integers, then {mα} ̸= {nα}.
If we order the numbers
{0,1,...,N} = {k0,k1,...,kN}
such that k′
j = kj+1 for j = 0,1,...,N −1, then k0 = 0, k1 = m, and kN = M. And
0 = {k0φ} < {k1φ} < ··· < {kNφ} < 1
(1.10)
is a partition of the interval [0,1] and the theorem states that this partition contains
intervals of at most three different lengths (Fig. 1.9).

Arithmetic Modulo One
Before presenting a proof of the Steinhaus Three Distance Conjecture we develop
some useful properties of arithmetic of fractional parts. As an application we estab-
lish a criterion for the irrationality of a real number.
Let N0 = [0,1,2,...}. Denote the fractional part of a real number a by {a}. If
a ≥0 then
{a} = a−⌊a⌋
where ⌊a⌋= max{n ∈N0 | n ≤a} is the ﬂoor of a. Alternatively, {a} is the unique
real such that
0 ≤{a} < 1, and a = {a}+n for some integer n.
(1.11)
It is immediate that
{a+b} =

{a}+{b}
if {a}+{b} < 1
{a}+{b}−1
if {a}+{b} ≥1 .
(1.12)
To see this write
a+b = {a}+{b}+⌊a⌋+⌊b⌋
and use the alternative characterization of the fractional part. Alternatively (1.12)
can be written as
{a}+{b} =

{a+b}
if {a}+{b} < 1
1+{a+b}
if {a}+{b} ≥1 .
(1.13)
Also, if {a} > {b}, then
{a}−{b} =

{a−b}
if a ≥b
1−{b−a}
if a < b .
The ﬁrst follows from
a−b = {a}−{b}+(⌊a⌋−⌊b⌋)
and the second from
b−a = 1+{b}−{a}+(⌊b⌋−⌊a⌋−1)
and the alternative characterization (1.11) of the fractional part.
Exercise 1.8.3. Show {a+{na}} = {(n+1)a} for all n ∈N.
Exercise 1.8.4. Show {m{na}} = {mna} for all m,n ∈N.
As an application of fractional parts let us prove a very special case of a theorem,
Theorem 6.5.3, due to Liouville.

Theorem 1.8.5 (Baby Liouville). Let a be a real number. Then a is irrational iff for
any ε > 0 there is an m ∈Z and an n ∈N such that a ̸= m
n and
a−m
n
 < ε
n.
Proof. Suppose a is irrational. Divide the closed interval [0,1] into a ﬁnite number
of subintervals each with length < ε. If j ̸= k are integers, then {ja} ̸= {ka}, since a
is irrational. Hence, the set {{ka} | k ∈N} is inﬁnite. Hence, one of the subintervals
must contain an inﬁnite number of the fractional parts {ka}, k ∈N. In particular,
there are two integers 0 < m < n such that
|{na}−{ma}| < ε.
Hence,
|(na−⌊na⌋)−(ma−⌊ma⌋)| < ε.
Setting k = ⌊na⌋−⌊ma⌋and dividing by n−m gives
a−

 <

Conversely, suppose a is rational. Then a = j
k for some integers j,k with k ≥1.
Let ε := 1

A Proof of the Steinhaus Three Distance Conjecture
Since {(m + M)φ} is either {mφ} + {Mφ} or {mφ} + {Mφ} −1 either {(m +
M)φ} > {Mφ} or {(m+M)φ} < {mφ} hence
N < m+M.
Fix a k in {0,1,...,N} with k ̸= M. Recall k′ is chosen to minimize {jφ}−{kφ} >
0.
Suppose k < k′
Then
{k′φ}−{kφ} = {(k′ −k)φ} ≥{mφ}
where there is equality if k′ −k = m. Thus k′ = k +m if k +m ≤N, that is
if 0 ≤k ≤N −m then m ≤k′ ≤N and k′ = k +m.

1.8 Steinhaus' Three Distance Conjecture⋆
35
Suppose k > k′
Then
{k′φ}−{kφ} = 1−{(k −k′)φ} ≥1−{Mφ}
where there is equality if k −k′ = M. Thus k′ = k −M if 0 ≤k −M, that is
if M ≤k ≤N then 0 ≤k′ ≤N −M and k′ = k −M.
Note this last line includes the case k = M. If N −m+1 = M then we are done. So
for the remainder of the proof it is assumed that
N +1 < m+M.
Suppose N −m < k < M
By the ranges established for k′ above it follows that N −M < k′ < m. In this case
is it shown below that
{k′φ}−{kφ} = {mφ}+1−{Mφ} and k′ = k +m−M.
Note k →k +m−M maps {x | N −m < x < M} onto {y | N −M < y < m}.
Suppose k < k′
Then as above
{k′φ}−{kφ} = {(k′ −k)φ} > {mφ}
and
{(k′ −k)φ}−{mφ} = 1−{(m−k′ +k)φ}
since k′ −k < k′ < m. Hence
{k′φ}−{kφ} = {mφ}+1−{(m−k′ +k)φ}
≥{mφ}+1−{Mφ}
with equality if m−k′ +k = M, that is for k′ = k +m−M.
Suppose k > k′
Then as above
{k′φ}−{kφ} = 1−{(k −k′)φ} > 1−{Mφ}

36
1 Limits
and
{Mφ}−{(k −k′)φ} = {(M −k +k′)φ}
since k −k′ < k < M. Hence
{k′φ}−{kφ} = 1−{Mφ}+{(M −k +k′)φ}
≥1−{Mφ}+{mφ}
with equality if M −k +k′ = m, that is for k′ = k +m−M.
Summary
There are three cases
0 ≤k ≤N −m =⇒k′ = k +m and {k′φ}−{kφ} = {mφ}
N −m < k < M =⇒k′ = k +m−M and
{k′φ}−{kφ} = {mφ}+1−{Mφ}

Solutions and Hints for the Exercises
Exercise 1.1.7. If 1/x is rational, then 1/x = p/q, for integers p,q ̸= 0. Hence
x = q/p contradicting that x is not rational. The other cases are similar.
Exercise 1.2.2. Let ε > 0 be given. If ε ≤m, then D∩B′
ε(c) ̸= /0 by assumption.
On the other hand, if m < ε, then
D∩B′
ε(c) ⊇D∩B′
m(c)
and the right hand side is nonempty by assumption.
Exercise 1.3.9. If |x−1/2| < 1/4, then −1/4 < x −1/2 < 1/4, and therefore
1/4 < x < 3/4. But 1/4 < x, implies 0 < 2/x < 8. Hence,

Exercise 1.3.11. (i). It is easy to justify:
g({x | 0 < |x−0| < δ}) ⊇{g(x) | 0 < x < δ}

(ii). For any real number L, either |L−1| ≥1 or |L−(−1)| ≥1.
Exercise 1.3.15. This follows from
|f(x)| = |L−(L+ f(x))| ≥|L|−|L−f(x)|.
An alternative argument is to show f(x) →L implies |f(x)| →|L| and then use
Local Positivity on g(x) = |f(x)|.
Exercise 1.4.7. Use Example 1.3.5, the Product Rule, and induction on n.
Exercise 1.4.8. One way is to use the Sum Rule and induction on the degree.
Exercise 1.4.10. This is similar to the last part of the proof of the Product Rule.
We need to control the size of the factor |1/g(x)|, hence we need a lower bound on
|g(x)|. This is provided by Local Positivity in the form of Exercise 1.3.15.
Exercise 1.4.15. Comparing to the Composition Rule with f(x) = 1 + x and

Chapter 2
Introduction to Continuity
In this chapter the algebra of continuous functions is established. A function that is
continuous at each irrational number and discontinuous at each rational number is
constructed. This function is know as the Riemann function, the Thomae function,
the ruler function, or the raindrop function.
Establishing some of the more subtle properties of continuous functions requires
properties of the set of real numbers that do not follow from the ordered ﬁeld ax-
ioms. The relevant properties of the set of real numbers are contained in Chap. 3.
We revisit continuity in Chap. 5, where we establish global properties of continuous
functions.
2.1 Deﬁnition and Algebra
Let D be a subset of C. A function f : D →C is continuous at a point a ∈D, if
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀x ∈D,|x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)−f(a)| < ε.
(2.1)
Using neighborhoods this can also be written as
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0, f (D∩Bδ(a)) ⊆Bε (f(a)).
If a is not an accumulation point of D, then there is a δ > 0, such that ∀x ∈D, |x−
a| < δ =⇒x = a. Such points are isolated. If a is isolated, the limit of f(x) as x →a
does not exist, but clearly, f is continuous at a. However, if a is an accumulation
point of D, Eq. (2.1) means
f(x) →f(a) as x →a.
Consequently, the algebra of limits leads to:
•
if f is continuous at a and k ∈C, then k f is continuous at a;
•
if f,g are continuous at a, then f +g is continuous at a;

2 Introduction to Continuity
•
if f,g are continuous at a, then fg is continuous at a;
•
if f.g are continuous at a and g(a) ̸= 0, then f
g is continuous at a.
The ﬁrst two of these are summarized by linearity, if f,g are continuous at x0 and
a,b are complex numbers, then af +bg is continuous at x0.
Theorem 2.1.1 (Composition Rule). If f is continuous at a and g is continuous at
b := f(a), then g◦f is continuous at a.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Since g is continuous at b, there is a γ > 0, such that
|y−b| < γ =⇒|g(y)−g(b)| < ε.
(2.2)
Since f is continuous at a and γ > 0, there is a δ > 0, such that
|x−a| < δ =⇒| f(x)−f(a)| < γ,
since b = f(a), Eq. (2.2) with y = f(x) implies
|g(f(x))−g( f(a))| = |g(y)−g(b)| < ε.
Thus g◦f is continuous at a.

We say f is continuous on D, if f is continuous at every point in D. We showed
in Sect. 1.4 that any rational function is continuous on the set of points where it is
deﬁned.
Example 2.1.2. f(z) := |z| is continuous on C.
Proof. Let a ∈C. Let ε > 0 be given. Let δ := ε. Then |z−a| < δ implies
|f(z)−f(a)| = ||z|−|a|| ≤|z−a| < δ = ε.
Hence Eq. (2.1) holds.

Exercise 2.1.3. Explain why
f(x) := |3+7|x||−|3x2 −8|9
5−|1−x2|
is continuous at 2.
Example 2.1.4. Let f : R →R be determined by f(x) :=

1
if x ≥3
−1
if x < 3 . Then f is
discontinuous, that is not continuous, at 3.
Proof. Since
lim
x↗3 f(x) = −1 ̸= 1 = lim
x↘3 f(x)
f does not have a limit at 3, in particular, f is not continuous at 3.

2.2 Removable Discontinuity

Example 2.1.5. Let f : C →R be determined by f(x) :=

8
if x ̸= 5
2
if x = 5 . Then
lim
x→5 f(x) = 8 ̸= 2 = f(5),
hence f is discontinuous at 5.
In preparation for the next example we need to know more about approximating
irrational numbers by rational numbers:
Exercise 2.1.6. Let a be some irrational number. Given any M ∈N, there is a γ > 0,
such that for all p ∈Z and q ∈N, q ≤M =⇒
a−p
q
 ≥γ.
Writing the contrapositive of the implication gives: Given any M ∈N, there is a
γ > 0, such that for all p ∈Z and q ∈N,
a−p
q
 < γ =⇒q > M.
Remark 2.1.7. Exercise 2.1.6 should be compared to Theorem 1.8.5.
The function in the following exercise is a modiﬁcation of the Dirichlet function.
Exercise 2.1.8 (Riemann Function). Let f : R →R be determined by
f(x) :=

1/q
when x = p/q for some p ∈Z,q ∈N in lowest terms
0
when x ∈R\Q
.
Show f is discontinuous at every point in Q and continuous at every point in R\Q.
We named this function after Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (17 September
1826, Breselenz to 20 July 1866, Selasca). It is also called the Thomae function,
after Carl Johannes Thomae (11 December 1840, Laucha an der Unstrut to 1 April
1921, Jena), the ruler function, the raindrop function among many other names.
Remark 2.1.9. Vito Volterra (3 May 1860, Ancona to 11 October 1940, Rome)
showed that we cannot have a function that is continuous at the rational numbers
and discontinuous at the irrationals. In fact, he showed that we cannot have two
functions for which the points of discontinuity of one are the points of continu-
ity of the other and vice versa (See Sect. 3.4). Thus, the roles of the rationals and
irrationals in the previous exercise cannot be reversed by some clever choice of f.
2.2 Removable Discontinuity
Suppose f is discontinuous at a. Then, f has a removable discontinuity at a, if there
is a function g, such that g is continuous at a and g(x) = f(x) for all x ̸= a. In the
deﬁnition of removable discontinuity, it does not matter whether or not f is deﬁned
at a.

48
2 Introduction to Continuity
Exercise 2.2.1. Suppose f is discontinuous at a. Then limx→a f(x) exists iff f has a
removable discontinuity at a.
Example 2.2.2. f(x) := x2−1
x−1 has a removable discontinuity at a = 1. Because, if
g(x) := x+1, then f(x) = g(x) for all x ̸= 1 and g is continuos at a = 1.
2.3 One-Sided Continuity
In this section we assume D ⊆R and f : D →C.
Let a ∈D. If
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀x ∈D,0 < x−a < δ =⇒| f(x)−f(a)| < ε,
then we say f is continuous from the right at a. In particular, if a is an accumulation
point of D, then limx↘a f(x) exists and equals f(a) if and only if f is continuous
from the right at a.
Similarly, f is continuous from the left at a, if
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀x ∈D,−δ < x−a < 0 =⇒| f(x)−f(a)| < ε.
If a is an accumulation point of D, this means limx↗a f(x) exists and equals f(a).
Example 2.3.1. Let f(x) :=

2
when x > 3
5
when x ≤3 . Then f is continuous from the left at
3, since limx↗3 f(x) = 5 = f(3). And f is not continuous from the right at 3 because
limx↘3 f(x) = 2 ̸= 5 = f(3).
Exercise 2.3.2. f is continuous at a iff f is both continuous from the right and left
at a.

Chapter 3
Sets of Real Numbers
Most of us believe we have a reasonable understanding of what a real number is.
However, sets of real numbers have some deep and surprising properties. We will
explore some of these properties in this chapter and in Chap. 4 on cardinality. Of
notable interest for future applications are the order completeness of R, the char-
acterization of intervals in terms of the intermediate value property, and the nested
interval theorem. Among other results we establish the existence of roots of positive
real numbers and we introduce the amazing Cantor set as well as related functions.
3.1 Supremum and Inﬁmum
In this section we investigate order completeness of sets of real numbers. These
properties are not all shared by the set of rational numbers.
Let A be a subset of R. A real number u is an upper bound for A, if a ∈A =⇒
a ≤u. That is, if ∀a ∈A,a ≤u.
Example 3.1.1. A few illustrative examples are:
1. 56 is an upper bound for A := {x ∈R | −34 ≤x ≤56} and 56 ∈A. Of course,
any number greater than 56 is also an upper bound for A.
2. 56 is an upper bound for B := {x ∈R | x < 56} and 56 /∈B.
3. Consider the set C :=

n
n+1 | n ∈N

= {1/2,2/3,...}. Since n < n+1, we have
n
n+1 < 1, hence 1 is an upper bound for C and 1 /∈C.
If u is an upper bound for A and u ∈A, then u is the maximum of A, in symbols this
is written: u = max(A).
Let A be some set of real numbers. Let u be a real number. If u is an upper bound
for A and no number smaller than u is an upper bound for A, then u is the least upper
bound for A. The least upper bound is also called the supremum and abbreviated by
sup(A).
Example 3.1.2. Using the notation from Example 3.1.1.

3 Sets of Real Numbers
1. sup(A) = 56.
2. sup(B) = 56.
3. sup(C) = 1.
Proof. We give a separate argument for each case.
1. We saw that 56 is an upper bound for A. No number smaller than 56 can be an
upper bound since 56 is in A.
2. We saw that 56 is an upper bound for B. Let v < 56, we will show that v is
not an upper bound for B, hence 56 is the smallest upper bound for B. To see
that v is not an upper bound for B we must ﬁnd x ∈B, such that v < x. We
claim that x := v + ε works, when ε := (56 −v)/2. Now v < 56 implies ε > 0.
Fig. 3.1 ν +ε is the midpoint of [ν,56]
Hence v < v + ε = x and x < x + ε. It remains to check that x + ε = 56. But,
x+ε = v+2ε = v+(56−v) = 56 (Fig. 3.1).
3. We saw that 1 is an upper bound for C. Suppose v < 1. We will show that v is not
an upper bound for C. To see this we must show there is an integer N, such that
v < N/(N +1). Since 0 < 1−v and (1/n) is null, there is an integer N, such that
1
n < 1−v for all n > N. Setting n = N +1 yields v < 1−
1
N+1 =
N
N+1.
This completes the veriﬁcation of the claims.

Exercise 3.1.3. Let A be a subset of R. Let u and v be real numbers. Suppose
(i) a ∈A =⇒a ≤u and
(ii) (a ∈A =⇒a ≤v) =⇒u ≤v.
Prove u = sup(A).
The following theorem establishes the existence of the supremum for any set of real
numbers that has an upper bound. In the proof we will repeatedly use that if we have
a nonempty ﬁnite set of integers with some property, then that set of integers has a
largest element. This is a very special case of the well ordering property of the set
of natural numbers.
Remark 3.1.4. For the set A :=

x ∈R | x2 < 2

an outline of the proof of the theo-
rem runs as follows: Using 12 < 2 < 22 we see d0 = 1 is not an upper bound for A
and d0 +1 = 2 is an upper bound for A. Using 1.42 < 2 < 1.52 we see d0.d1 = 1.4
is not an upper bound for A and d0.d1 + 1/10 = 1.5 is an upper bound for A.
Since 1.412 < 2 < 1.422 we see d0.d1d2 = 1.41 is not an upper bound for A and
d0.d1d2 + 1/102 = 1.42 is an upper bound for A. Continuing in this manner we
construct the least upper bound d0.d1d2 ··· for A as an inﬁnite decimal.
For the set A := {x ∈R | x < 56} this process yields the inﬁnite decimal 55.9 as
the least upper bound.

3.1 Supremum and Inﬁmum
53
Theorem 3.1.5 (Order Completeness of R). Let A be a nonempty subset of R. If A
has an upper bound, then A has a least upper bound.
Proof. Step 1: Construction of a candidate for the sup. Let u be an upper bound
for A. If u = ±e0.e1e2 ··· , is an inﬁnite decimal representation of u, then u ≤e0 +1.
Hence, we have found an integer N := e0 +1 that is an upper bound for A. If a ∈A,
and a = ± f0.f1 f2 ··· is an inﬁnite decimal representation of a, then −( f0 +2) < a.
Hence, we have found an integer M := −f0 −2 that is not an upper bound for A.
See Fig. 3.2. To begin the construction of sup(A), let
Fig. 3.2 Illustrating that M = −( f0 + 2) is not an upper bound for A and N = e0 + 1 is an upper
bound for A
B0 := {k ∈Z | M ≤k and k is not an upper bound for A}.
Then M ∈B0 and N /∈B0 is an upper bound for B0. Hence, B0 has at most N −M
elements, in particular, B0 is ﬁnite. Let L be the largest element of B0. Then L is not
an upper bound for A and L+1 is an upper bound for A. (A ﬁgure similar to Fig. 3.3,
but with N −M +1 tick marks illustrates this.) Assume L ≥0. Let d0 = L. Then d0
is not an upper bound for A and d0 +1 is an upper bound for A.
Let
B1 :=

k ∈Z | 0 ≤k and d0 + k
10 is not an upper bound for A

.
Then 0 ∈B1, since d0 is not an upper bound for A, and 10 /∈B1, since d0 + 1 is an
upper bound for A. Hence, B1 is a subset of {0,1,...,9}, in particular, B1 is ﬁnite.
Let d1 be the largest element of B1. Then 0 ≤d1 ≤9, d0.d1 is not an upper bound
for A, and d0.d1 +1/10 is an upper bound for A. See Fig. 3.3.
Fig. 3.3 Since d0.0 is not an upper bound and d0 +1 is an upper bound, there is a k such that d0.k
is not an upper bound and d0.k +1/10 is an upper bound
Let
B2 :=

k ∈Z | 0 ≤k, and d0.d1 +
k
102 is not an upper bound for A

.
Then 0 ∈B2, since d0.d1 is not an upper bound for A, and 10 /∈B2, since d0.d1+1/10
is an upper bound for A. Hence, B2 is a subset of {0,1,...,9}, in particular, B2 is

54
3 Sets of Real Numbers
ﬁnite. Let d2 be the largest element of B2. Then 0 ≤d2 ≤9, d0.d1d2 is not an upper
bound for A, and d0.d1d2 +1/102 is an upper bound for A.
Continuing in this manner (i.e., by induction) we end up with a real number
u := d0.d1d2 ···
such that for each n ∈N, d0.d1d2 ···dn is not an upper bound for A and d0.d1d2 ···dn+
1/10n is an upper bound for A.
Step 2: Showing the candidate works. To complete the proof we must show (i)
that u is an upper bound for A and (ii) that no v < u is an upper bound for A.
(i) Let a ∈A. For any n, d0.d1d2 ···dn + 10−n is an upper bound for A. Hence
a ≤d0.d1d2 ···dn +1/10n for all n. Consequently,
a−1
10n ≤d0.d1d2 ...dn ≤u.
Since (1/10n) is null, we conclude a ≤u. Thus u is an upper bound for A.
(ii) Suppose v is an upper bound for A. For any n, d0.d1d2 ···dn is not an upper
bound for A. Hence there is an an ∈A such that d0.d1d2 ···dn ≤an. Now ν is an
upper bound for A, in particular, an ≤ν. By the transitive property of inequalities,
d0.d1d2 ···dn ≤v for all n. Letting n →∞, we get u ≤v, since d0.d1d2 ···dn →u.

Exercise 3.1.6. Complete the proof of the order completeness of R by modifying
the proof above such that it works in the case where L < 0.
Deﬁne sup(/0) = −∞. Set sup(A) = ∞, if A does not have an upper bound. Then any
subset of R has a supremum sup(A). The previous theorem can therefore be restated
as
if A ̸= /0 has an upper bound, then sup(A) ∈R.
Inﬁmum
Let A be a subset of R and let m ∈R. If m ≤a for all a ∈A, then m is a lower
bound for A. If m is an lower bound for A and m ∈A, then m is the minimum of A in
symbols this is written: U = min(A). A number m is a greatest lower bound for A,
if m is a lower bound and no larger number is a lower bound for A. A greatest lower
bound is also called an inﬁmum and denoted by inf(A). Let −A := {−a | a ∈A}.
Exercise 3.1.7. (i) Prove m is a lower bound for A iff −m is an upper bound for −A.
(ii) Prove inf(A) = sup(−A).
Theorem 3.1.8. If A has a lower bound, then A has a greatest lower bound.
Proof. One approach to the proof is to imitate the proof that the supremum is a real
number above. On the other hand it might be simpler to use that theorem to prove
this one. This is the proof outlined in the previous exercise.


3.2 Intervals
55
Deﬁne inf(/0) = ∞. If A does not have a lower bound we will write inf(A) = −∞.
Having established that sets with upper bounds have a least upper bound and sets
with lower bounds have a greatest lower bound we can, and will, from now on, for
the most part forget about inﬁnite decimals.
3.2 Intervals
In this section, we give a characterization of intervals in terms of a property that is
useful in our study of continuous functions. We will establish this as a ﬁrst conse-
quence of the order completeness of the set of all real numbers.
A closed interval is a set of the form
[a,b] := {x ∈R | a ≤x ≤b},
[a,∞[ := {x ∈R | a ≤x} = {x ∈R | a ≤x < ∞},
]−∞,b] := {x ∈R | x ≤b} = {x ∈R | −∞< x ≤b}, or
]−∞,∞[ := {x ∈R | −∞< x < ∞} = R.
Where a ≤b are real numbers. An open interval is a set of the form
]a,b[ := {x ∈R | a < x < b},
]a,∞[ := {x ∈R | a < x} = {x ∈R | a < x < ∞},
]−∞,b[ := {x ∈R | x < b} = {x ∈R | −∞< x < b}, or
]−∞,∞[ := {x ∈R | −∞< x < ∞} = R.
Where a < b are real numbers. A half-open interval is a set of the form
]a,b] := {x ∈R | a < x ≤b} or
[a,b[ := {x ∈R | a ≤x < b}.
Where a < b are real numbers. A half-open interval is also called half-closed. An
interval is a subset of R that is either an open, a closed, or a half-open interval. Note,
the interval ]−∞,∞[ is both open and closed.
A subset A of R has the intermediate value property, if for any x and y in A and
any t in R,
x < t < y =⇒t ∈A.
It is easy to see that any interval has the intermediate value property. Conversely,
any subset of R that has the intermediate value property is an interval:
Theorem 3.2.1 (Interval Theorem). Let A be a nonempty subset of R. Then A has
the intermediate value property if and only if A is an interval.
Proof. Clearly, any interval has the intermediate value property. Conversely, sup-
pose A has the intermediate value property. Let a := inf(A) and b := sup(A). As-

56
3 Sets of Real Numbers
sume a and b both are ﬁnite. Then a is a lower bound for A and b is an upper bound
for A, consequently A ⊆[a,b]. Let t ∈R be such that a < t < b. Since a < t and
a = inf(A) is the greatest lower bound for A, we see t is not a lower bound for A.
Hence, there is an x ∈A, such that inf(A) ≤x < t. Similarly, there is a y ∈A, such
that t < y ≤sup(A). We have found x,y in A, such that x < t < y, hence, using the
intermediate value property, t ∈A. Since t ∈]a,b[ was arbitrary, the open interval
]a,b[ is a subset of A. The points a and b may or may not be in A, hence A is one of
the intervals, ]a,b[,[a,b[,]a,b], or [a,b].

Exercise 3.2.2. Complete the proof of the Interval Theorem by considering the
cases where a = −∞and/or b = ∞.
3.3 The Nested Interval Theorem
When we say that π = 3.14159··· , we usually interpret this to mean that we know
d0 = 3,d1 = 1,d2 = 4,d3 = 1,d4 = 5,d5 = 9 and we do not know anything about the
digits dk with k > 5. If those digits are 0's then π = 3.14159, if those digits are 9's
then π = 3.14159+1/105 = 3.14160. In all other cases π is somewhere in between
those two extremes.
More formally, given a positive integer d0 and digits dn ∈{0,1,...,9} let
Ik :=

d0.d1d2 ···dk,d0.d1d2 ···dk + 1
10k

.
(3.1)
Then Ik is the set of real numbers that have a decimal expansion beginning with
d0.d1d2 ···dk. In particular, Ik+1 ⊂Ik and
∞

k=1
Ik = {d0.d1d2 ···}.
The Nested Interval Theorem is a generalization of this to intervals whose endpoints
need not be ﬁnite decimals.
The following results states that if a ∈A and b ∈B implies a ≤b, then there is
a real number t separating A and B, in the sense that a ≤t ≤b for all a ∈A and all
b ∈B.
Proposition 3.3.1. Let A and B be nonempty subsets of R. If any number in A is less
than or equal to any number in B, then there is a number t, such that any number in
A is less than or equal to t and any number in B is greater than or equal to t.
Proof. Any number b in B is an upper bound for A, hence, sup(A) ≤b for any b ∈B.
So sup(A) is a lower bound for B, and therefore sup(A) ≤inf(B). Consequently, any
number t between sup(A) and inf(B) works.

A sequence of intervals (In)n∈N , such that In+1 ⊆In for all n ∈N, is nested. If

3.3 The Nested Interval Theorem
57
Fig. 3.4 A few nested intervals [a0,b0] ⊃[a1,b1] ⊃···
the lengths of the nested intervals form a null sequence, it appears that the intervals
have exactly one point in common, see Fig. 3.4. This is the content of the following
theorem. We repeat the idea of the proof of Proposition 3.3.1 in the proof below.
Theorem 3.3.2 (Nested Interval Theorem, Cantor's Principle).
Suppose the
closed intervals ([an,bn])n∈N are nested and the sequence of lengths of these in-
tervals (bn −an) is null, then there is an x ∈R, such that
∞

n=1
[an,bn] = {x}.
That is, the intersection contains exactly one point.
Proof. Since the intervals are nested we have
ai ≤ai+1 ≤ai+2 ≤··· ≤aj ≤bj ≤··· ≤bi+2 ≤bi+1 ≤bi
for all i ≤j. Hence, for i ≤j,
ai ≤aj ≤bj ≤bi.
Consequently, i ≤j implies ai ≤b j and aj ≤bi. Since i and j are arbitrary we have
shown that
∀m,n ∈N,am ≤bn.
Hence, if A := {am | m ∈N} and B := {bn | n ∈N}, then any number in A is less
than or equal to any number in B. Consequently, a := sup(A) and b := inf(B) are
ﬁnite and a ≤b.
If a < b, then 0 < b−a ≤bn −an contradicts that (bn −an) is null. Hence, a = b.
It remains to establish that {a} = ∞
n=1[an,bn]. We will show ⊆and ⊇.
⊆For all n ∈N, an ≤a, since a is an upper bound for {an | n ∈N}. Similarly,
b ≤bn for all n ∈N, since b is a lower bound for the set {bn | n ∈N}. Hence,
an ≤a = b ≤bn for all n ∈N. So, a ∈[an,bn] for all n ∈N. Thus a ∈∞
n=1[an,bn]
and consequently {a} ⊆∞
n=1[an,bn].
⊇Conversely, if x ∈∞
n=1[an,bn], then an ≤x ≤bn for all n ∈N. Hence, x is
an upper bound for the set {an | n ∈N}. Since a is the smallest upper bound for
{an | n ∈N} it follows that a ≤x. Similarly, x ≤b. By transitivity of inequality,
a ≤x ≤b. Hence, b = a implies x = a. Consequently, ∞
n=1[an,bn] ⊆{a}.

Exercise 3.3.3. Adopt the notation from the statement of the Nested Interval Theo-
rem above. Let δ > 0 be given. Prove, there is an N, such that
[aN,bN] ⊂]x−δ,x+δ[.
The following version of the Nested Interval Theorem, called the Binary Nested
Interval Theorem, reﬂects the way we often construct the intervals we apply the
Nested Interval Theorem to. We use the term "binary" because at each stage we
pick the left or right half of the previous interval.
Theorem 3.3.4 (Binary Nested Interval Theorem). Let a < b be real numbers.
Let a0 := a and b0 := b. For each n ≥0, let cn := (an + bn)/2 and suppose either
an+1 = an and bn = cn, or an+1 = cn and bn+1 = bn, then
∞

n=0
[an,bn] = {x}
for some real number x.
Proof. Since an < cn < bn the intervals [an,bn] are nested. By construction bn−an =
(b −a)/2n. It remains to check ((b−a)/2n) is null. But this follows from the fact
that (1/2n) is null (Theorem 1.7.1).

3.4 Sets of Continuity⋆
As an interesting application of the Nested Interval Theorem we prove Volterra's
observation regarding sets of continuity. The proof is essentially Volterra's.
Theorem 3.4.1 (Volterra). Let I be an interval and let f and g be functions I →C.
Let A ⊂I be the set of points where f is continuous and let B ⊂I be the set of points
where g is continuous. If A and B are dense subsets of I, then the intersection of A
and B is nonempty.
The following lemma helps organize the proof. For a closed interval J = [a,b] let
◦
J := ]a,b[ be the corresponding open interval.

3.4 Sets of Continuity⋆
59
Lemma 3.4.2. Let I, f,g,A, and B be as in the theorem. If J is a closed and bounded
subinterval of I and ε > 0, then there is a closed interval K ⊂
◦
J such that the length
of K is less than ε and
|f (x)−f (y)| < ε and |g(x)−g(y)| < ε
for all x and y in K.
Proof. Fix two points a < b in I such that J = [a,b]. Let x0 ∈A∩(a,b). Since f is
continuous at x0, there is a δ ′ > 0, such that
∀x ∈J,|x−x0| ≤δ ′ =⇒|f (x)−f (x0)| < ε/2.
(3.2)
Let a′ := max{a,x0 −δ ′} and b′ := min{b,x0 +δ ′}. Consider the closed interval
I′ := [a′,b′], then x0 ∈
◦
I′, since a < x0 < b and I′ ⊆J, since a ≤a′ and b′ ≤b. If x
and y are in I′, then (3.2) yields
|f (x)−f (y)| ≤|f (x)−f (x0)|+|f (x0)−f (y)| < ε
2 + ε
2 = ε.
because |x−x0| ≤δ ′ and |y−x0| ≤δ ′. Hence,
∀x,y ∈I′,|f(x)−f(y)| < ε,
(3.3)
Similarly, let y0 ∈B ∩(a′,b′). Since g is continuous at y0, there is a δ ′′ > 0, such
that
∀x ∈I′,|x−y0| ≤δ ′′ =⇒|g(x)−g(y0)| < ε
2.
(3.4)
Let a′′ := max{a′,y0 −δ ′′} and b′′ := min{b′,y0 +δ ′′}. Consider the closed inter-
val I′′ := [a′′,b′′], then y0 ∈
◦
I′′, since a′ < y0 < b′ and I′′ ⊆I′, since a′ ≤a′′ and
b′′ ≤b′. If x and y are in I′′, then (3.4) yields
∀x,y ∈I′′,|g(x)−g(y)| < ε.
because |x−y0| ≤δ ′′ and |y−y0| ≤δ ′′.
By construction I′′ ⊆I′ ⊆J. Let K be a closed subinterval of I′′ with length at
most ε such that K ⊂
◦
J.

The idea of the proof of the theorem is to apply the lemma inductively to con-
struct a nested sequence of close intervals In such that |f (x)−f (y)| < 1
n for all x,y
in In.
Proof. [Proof of the theorem] Let J := [a,b] be any closed and bounded subinterval
of I and let ε = 1. By the lemma there is a closed interval I1 ⊂
◦
J with length at most
1, such that
|f (x)−f (y)| < 1 and |g(x)−g(y)| < 1

60
3 Sets of Real Numbers
for all x,y ∈I1. Let ε := 1/2. By the lemma with J = I1, there is a closed interval
I2 ⊂
◦
I1 with length at most 1/2, such that
|f (x)−f (y)| < 1
2 and |g(x)−g(y)| < 1
2
for all x,y ∈I2. Continuing in this manner we get a sequence of closed intervals
In = [an,bn] such that (a) the length bn −an of In is at most 1/n, (b) In+1 ⊂
◦
In, and
(c)
|f (x)−f (y)| < 1
n and |g(x)−g(y)| < 1
n
(3.5)
for all x,y ∈In. By the Nested Interval Theorem there is a z0 real number such that
{z0} =
∞

n=1
In.
We claim f and g are continuous at z0. To verify this claim, let ε′ > 0 be given.
Fix and integer n > 1/ε′. By construction z0 ∈In+1 ⊂
◦
In. Let
δ := min{z0 −an,bn −z0}.
(3.6)
Then δ > 0, since z0 ∈
◦
In = ]an,bn[. Suppose x is a real number and |x−z0| < δ.
By (3.6), x ∈In, consequently (3.5) implies
|f (x)−f (z)| < 1
n < ε′ and |g(x)−g(z)| < 1
n < ε′.
Establishing continuity of f and g at z0. Hence, z0 is in the intersection of A and B.
Thus A∩B is nonempty.

Combining the theorem with the Riemann function (Exercise 2.1.8) we conclude:
Corollary 3.4.3. There does not exist an interval I and a function f : I →C, such
that f is continuous at each rational in I and discontinuous at each irrational in I.
This claim is part of Remark 2.1.9.
Corollary 3.4.4. Consider an interval I and a function f : I →C. If f is continuous
at each rational in I then f is continuous at least one irrational in I.
3.5 Roots
In this section, we show that if x is a positive real number and n is a positive integer,
then x has an nth−root in the sense that yn = x for some real number y. We also
present a method that can be used to show that certain roots are not rational numbers.

Existence of Roots
We will use the Binary Nested Interval Theorem to establish the existence the nth
root x1/n of a positive real number x.
Suppose we want to construct
√

√
2 < 2. Repeatedly dividing the relevant interval, starting with [1,2], in half gives

Continuing this process by induction is the essence of our proof that 2 has a square
root.
Theorem 3.5.1. Let x > 0 be a real number and k ∈N. There is a real number y > 0,
such that yk = x. Thus x1/k = y.
Proof. If k = 1 or x = 1 we may set y := x. Hence, we will assume k > 1 and x ̸= 1.
If 0 < x < 1, let a0 = x and b0 = 1. If 1 < x, let a0 = 1 and b0 = x. In either case
ak
0 < x < bk.
0 .
Let c0 := (a0 + b0)/2. Then ak
0 < ck
0 < bk
0. If ck
0 = x, let y := c0. If ak
0 < x < ck
0,
let a1 := a0 and b1 := c0. If ck
0 < x < bk
0 let a1 := c0 and b1 := b0. In either case,
ak
1 < x < bk
1.
Let c1 := (a1 + b1)/2. Then ak
1 < ck
1 < bk
1. If ck
1 = x, let y := c1. If ak
1 < x < ck
1,
let a2 := a1 and b2 := c1. If ck
1 < x < bk
1 let a2 := c1 and b2 := b1. In either case,
ak
2 < xk < bk
2.
Continuing in this manner, either the process is stopped at some point because
ck
n = x, or we get an and bn as in the Binary Nested Interval Theorem with ak
n < x <
bk
n for all k ∈N. Let y be the real number satisfying
∞

n=0
[an,bn] = {y}.
It remains to check that yk = x. Using ak
n < x < bk
n and an ≤y ≤bn we conclude
{x,yk} ⊆

n=0
[ak

The intervals [ak


Remark 3.5.2. The proof is an algorithm that allows us to estimate y = x1/k, because
an ≤y ≤bn implies |cn −y| ≤(bn −an)/2, since cn is the midpoint of [an,bn]. So
bn −an = (b0 −a0)/2n, tell us that y ≈cn with error at most (b0 −a0)/2n+1 =
|x−1|/2n+1.

Irrationality of Roots
We use the case
√
2 to illustrate a method that can be used to show that (p/q)1/n is
irrational for many choices of positive integers p,q, and n.
Theorem 3.5.4.
√
2 is irrational.
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose

2nb = 2nb ∈N and

hence, for all k ∈N0,

Since 1 <

hence cannot be null. This contradiction completes the proof.

Alternatively, a contradiction can be obtained using well ordering of N in place

Remark 3.5.5. The argument illustrates a general method for proving that numbers
are irrational or even transcendental: (a) suppose the number of interest is rational or
algebraic, (b) use (a) to set up equalities xn = yn, (c) establish |xn| < 1, and (d) show
(yn) is a sequence of nonzero integers. See the proofs that e and π are irrational and
e is transcendental for other examples of this strategy in action.
3.6 Cantor Set
Not everyone likes to work with numbers in base 10. Some like base 2. In this text
popular choices are base 2, base 3, and base 10.
A ﬁnite decimal is a number of the form d0.d1 ···dn = d0 + d1/10 + d2/102 +
··· + dn/10n, where d0 is an integer and dk is in {0,1,...,9} for 1 ≤k. Given an
integer b > 1 we can replace the 10 by b. That is, we interpret the ﬁnite "decimal"
d0.
bd1 ···dn where d0 ∈N0 and dj ∈{0,1,...,b−1} with respect to base b as
d0.
bd1 ···dn = d0 + d1
b + d2
b2 +···+ dn
bn .
We can then expand this to inﬁnite base b representations d0.
bd1d2 ··· . When b = 2
we say binary number, when b = 3 ternary number, and when b = 10 decimal
number.
The discussion of nonunique expansions for decimal numbers carry over without
major changes to base b representations. The details are left for the reader to work
out. For example, any 0 ≤x < 1 can be represented as
x = 0.
bd1d2 ...
and this representation is unique, if we do not allow representations ending in b−1.
The representation of 0 < x < 1 is also unique, if we do not allow representations
ending in 0. By long division any rational number has a representation in any base.
It remains to check that the set of real numbers does not depend on the choice
of base. That is, for example, that set of ternary numbers coincides with the set of
decimal numbers. Let
x := d0.
3d1d2 ···
be a ternary number. Then

By the Nested Interval Theorem x is a decimal number. The proof that any deci-
mal number is a ternary number is similar. However, we proved the Nested Inter-
val Theorem for decimal numbers. So to establish that any decimal number is a
ternary number we have to establish the Nested Interval Theorem for ternary num-
bers. Clearly, this can be done using the method we used to establish the Nested
Interval Theorem for decimal numbers.
The Cantor set was introduced by Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (3
March 1845 Saint Petersburg - to January 1918 Halle) in 1883 while he was working
on a problem related to Fourier series. The Cantor set, more precisely the middle
thirds Cantor set, or ternary Cantor set, is the set
C :=
	
0.
3d1d2 ...
dj ∈{0,2}

.
That is, C is the set of base three numbers, in the interval [0,1], that can be con-
structed using only the digits 0 and 2.
The term middle thirds comes from an alternative construction of C. Let C0 :=
[0,1]. Let C1 be obtained from C0 by removing the middle third of the interval in
C0. Inductively, let Ck+1 be obtained from Ck by removing the open middle third of
each intervals in Ck.

Chapter 4
Counting
This chapter contains a brief introduction to cardinality. The focus is on countable
sets. Of course, Cantor's results that an interval is not countable and that the set of
irrational numbers is uncountable are also included. In fact, most of the results in
this chapter are due to Cantor.
4.1 Countable Sets
Any set that can be arranged in a list a1,a2,a3,..., possibly with repetitions, is
countable.
Example 4.1.1. {1,2,3} can be arranged as 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,... Hence, the ﬁnite
set, {1,2,3} is countable.
Similarly, any ﬁnite set is countable. An inﬁnite set that is countable is countably
inﬁnite. The basic countably inﬁnite set is
N = {1,2,3,...}.
Lemma 4.1.2. The union of two countable sets is a countable set.
Proof. Suppose A and B are countable. If a1,a2,... is a listing of A and b1,b2,... is
a listing of B, then
a1,b1,a2,b2,a3,b3,···
is the required list of the elements of the union A∪B.

Repeating this argument shows that a ﬁnite union of countable sets is countable.
Example 4.1.3. The set of integers Z is countable, because we can list the integers
as
0,−1,1,−2,2,....

Alternatively, we can write Z as the union of
N0 = {0,1,2,...}
and
−N = {−1,−2,...}.
Lemma 4.1.4. If Ak is ﬁnite for all k in N, then ∞
k=1 Ak is countable.
Proof. Writing the elements of A1 (in some order), then the elements of A2, and so
on gives the required list.

This argument does not work, if at least one of the Ak's is countable inﬁnite. For
example, if A1 is inﬁnite we will never get to list the elements of A2. However, it is
true that a countable union of countable sets is a countable set:
Theorem 4.1.5. If Ak is countable for all k ∈N, then ∞
k=1 Ak is countable.
Proof. Write Ak := {ak,1,ak,2,ak,3,...}. Let Bm := {ai, j | i + j = m}. See Fig. 4.1.
Then Bm has m −1 element, hence is ﬁnite. Consequently, ∞
k=1 Ak = ∞
m=2 Bm is
countable by the lemma.

Fig. 4.1 Instead of counting along the rows we count along the diagonals. Using the notation from
the proof of Theorem 4.1.5 A1 is the top row, A2 is the second row, etc. and B2 is the diagonal with
one dot, B3 is the diagonal with two dots, and so on
Exercise 4.1.6. Use the theorem to prove that the set of rational numbers is count-
able.
Theorem 4.1.7 (Cantor). The interval [0,1] is not countable.

4.1 Countable Sets
71
Proof. [First proof that [0,1] is not countable.] Suppose [0,1] is countable. Let
{y1,y2,...} = [0,1]. Let x := 0.d1d2 ··· where
dn :=

8
if the nth digit of yn is ≤4
3
if the nth digit of yn is ≥5 .
For any n, x ̸= yn, because they have different nth digits. Consequently, x is not on
the list.

The choice of 3 and 8 as the digits is mostly arbitrary. We just wanted to avoid
possible complications resulting from repeating 9's. This proof is an example of the
Cantor Diagonal Argument.
Proof. [Second proof that [0,1] is not countable.] Suppose [0,1] is countable. Let
{y1,y2,...} = [0,1]. Let [a0,b0] := [0,1]. Inductively, for k ∈N, let [ak,bk] be the
left or right third of [ak−1,bk−1] that does not contain yk. If neither the left nor the
right third of [ak−1,bk−1] contains yk we let [ak,bk] be the left third of [ak−1,bk−1].
By construction yk /∈[ak,bk] for all k and the intervals [ak,bk] are nested. Since
bk −ak = 1/3k is null, it follows from the Nested Interval Theorem that
∞

k=0
[ak,bk] = {x},
for some x ∈[0,1].
It remains to check that x is not one of the y′
ns. But for any n, x ∈[an,bn] and
yn /∈[an,bn]. Thus, x ̸= yn for all n.

We used thirds instead of halves in the proof, because 1/2 is in the left and in the
right half of [0,1].
Exercise 4.1.8. The Cantor set C is not countable.
A set that is not countable is uncountable. A listing a1,a2,a3,... of a countable
set is an enumeration of that set. An enumeration of a countably inﬁnite set can
be assumed not to include duplicates. Such an enumeration can be constructed by
starting at the beginning of the list and deleting duplicates as they are encountered
when we move through the list.
Exercise 4.1.9. A subset of a countable set is countable.
Exercise 4.1.10. If A is uncountable and B is any set, then A∪B is uncountable.
Exercise 4.1.11. R is uncountable.
Exercise 4.1.12. If A and B are countable, so is A×B := {(a,b) | a ∈A,b ∈B}.

4 Counting
4.2 Uncountable Sets⋆
We saw above that a set A is countably inﬁnite iff it can be written as an inﬁnite list
a1,a2,a3,... without duplicates. That is, a set A is countably inﬁnite iff there is a
bijection f : N →A. Speciﬁcally, when A is listed without duplicates the bijection is
determined by f(n) := an. This idea can be used to compare the size of any two sets
A and B. We say A and B have the same number of elements if there is a bijection
f : A →B. Similarly, A has fewer elements than B if there is a one-to-one may
f : A →B and A has more elements than B if there is a one-to-one map g : B →A.
The following results say that this terminology makes sense.
Proposition 4.2.1. Let A and B be sets. There is a one-to-one map f : A →B iff there
is a surjective map g : B →A.
Proof. If f : A →B is 1−1. Fix a point a0 in A. Deﬁne
g(b) :=

a
if b = f(a)
a0
if b /∈f (A) .
Then g : B →A is surjective.
Conversely, suppose g : B →A is surjective. For each a ∈A, the set
g−1 ({a}) := {b ∈B | g(b) = a}
is nonempty, since g maps B onto A. Let f(a) be one of the elements of g−1 ({a}).
Then g( f(a)) = a, so f is an injection. In fact, if f (a1) = f (a2), then a1 =
g( f (a1)) = g( f (a2)) = a2.

Theorem 4.2.2 (Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder Theorem). If A both has fewer and
more elements than B, then A and B have the same number of elements.
Proof. Let f : A →B and g : B →A be 1−1 functions. Let
A := {C ⊆A | A\g(B) ⊆C and g( f(C)) ⊆C}.
Note A ∈A . Let X be the intersection of all the sets in A . That is
X = ∩A =

C∈A
C.
Clearly A\g(B) is a subset of X and g( f(X)) ⊆X, hence X ∈A . By construction
C ∈A =⇒X ⊆C. We aim to show that
h(x) =

f(t)
if t ∈X
g−1(t)
if t ∈A\X

4.2 Uncountable Sets⋆
73
is a bijection of A onto B. We need A \ X ⊆g(B) to make sense out of the second
part of the deﬁnition. Once we have that, we need to verify that the resulting map is
1−1 and onto.
Let Y = g( f(X)) ∪(A \ g(B)), then Y ⊆X ∪(A \ g(B)) ⊆X. Hence, g( f(Y)) ⊆
g(f(X)) ⊆X, consequently, Y ∈A . So X ⊆Y and therefore X = Y. We have shown
that
X = g( f(X))∪(A\g(B))
(4.1)
In particular, A\X ⊆g(B).
If h is not 1−1 then for some s ∈X and t ∈A\X we have f(s) = g−1(t). That is
g(f(s)) = t, but then g( f(s)) ∈X and t /∈X gives a contradiction, hence h is 1−1.
To show that h is onto pick b ∈B, either g(b) ∈X or g(b) ∈A\X. In the second
case b = h(g(b)) ∈h(A). In the ﬁrst case g(b) ∈g(f(X)) by (4.1), so b ∈f(X) ⊆
h(A). In both cases b ∈h(A), thus h is onto.

The theorem is named after Cantor of Cantor set fame, Felix Bernstein (February
24, 1878, Halle to December 3, 1956, Zurich) and Friedrich Wilhelm Karl Ernst
Schröder (25 November 1841 in Mannheim to 16 June 1902, Karlsruhe).
We discuss some examples suggesting that using bijections to decide if two sets
have the same size is not always appropriate. The map f(x) := 2x determines a
bijection of [0,1] onto [0,2]. So the two intervals have the same number of elements.
Of course they have different lengths.
Example 4.2.3. (a) Exercise 3.6.1 constructs a surjection C →[0,1] mapping the
Cantor set onto the interval [0,1], hence (by the proposition) there is an injective
map f1 : [0,1] →C. Clearly f2(x) = x is an injective may C →[0,1], so by Can-
tor-Bernstein-Schroeder there is a bijection f : C →[0,1].
(b) Similar to part (a) it follows from Exercise 3.6.2 that there is a bijection
g : C →[0,1]2 between the Cantor set C and the square [0,1]2 = [0,1]×[0,1].
(c) Combining (a) and (b) we see that, h := g◦f −1 : [0,1] →[0,1]2 is a bijection
between the interval [0,1] and the square [0,1]2. Hence, both the interval [0,1] and
the square [0,1]2 both have the same number of elements as C.
To distinguish the size of the closed interval [0,1] from the size of the square
[0,1]2 we might consider area or some notion of dimension, e.g., "topological" di-
mension.
ZFC is an abbreviation of: Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice,
the standard set of axioms most mathematics is based on. ZFC is named after Ernst
Friedrich Ferdinand Zermelo (27 July 1871 Berlin to 21 May 1953 Freiburg im
Breisgauand) and Abraham Halevi (Adolf) Fraenkel (17 February 1891 Munich to
15 October 1965 Jerusalem). The C is for the axiom of choice.
The continuum hypothesis, due to Cantor, states that any set of real numbers is
either countable or bijective to [0,1]. Less formally, no subset of R is both more
inﬁnite than N and less inﬁnite than [0,1].
In 1939 Kurt Friedrich Gödel (28 April 1906 Brno to 14 January 1978 Prince-
ton) showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be disproved based on ZFC. In
1963 Paul Joseph Cohen (2 April 1934 Long Branch to 23 March 2007 Stanford)

74
4 Counting
showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be proved based on on ZFC. Thus the
continuum hypothesis is independent of "normal" mathematics in the sense that it
can neither be proven nor disproven.
We have seen that there are problems with only considering the size of inﬁnite
sets using comparisons based on the existence of injective or bijective maps and
that in some cases it seems more sensible to consider length, area, or volume as a
measure of size. That difﬁculties must remain is shown by Stefan Banach (30 March
1892 Kraków to 31 August 1945 Lviv) and Alfred Tarski (14 January 1901 Warsaw
to 26 October 1983 Berkeley):
Example 4.2.4 (Banach-Tarski Paradox, 1924). In R3 the unit ball B := {x ∈R3 |
|x| ≤1} can be partitioned into ﬁve disjoint sets Ej, j = 1,2,3,4,5 in such a way
that D1 ∪D2 = B and B = D3 ∪D4 ∪D5 where each Dj is obtained from the cor-
responding Ej by a rigid motion. A rigid motion is a combination of rotations and
translations.
Proof. You must be joking. This is well beyond the scope of this course.

Despite all these difﬁculties the inﬂuential mathematician David Hilbert (23 Jan-
uary 1862 Königsberg to 14 February 1943 Göttingen) stated: "No one will drive us
from the paradise which Cantor created for us" Hilbert (1926).

Chapter 5
Continuity
We discuss continuity and limit of monotone functions, the intermediate value the-
orem and show that a continuous image of a compact interval is a compact interval
and that a continuous function deﬁned on a compact interval is uniformly continu-
ous. These results are all global in the sense that they depend on the function being
continuous on an interval; the pointwise (local) results about continuity are con-
tained in Chap. 2. The main tool used in the proofs is the Nested Interval Theorem.
5.1 Monotone Functions
Let I be some interval. A function f : I →R is increasing, if for all x,y in I,
x < y =⇒f(x) ≤f(y).
We say f is strictly increasing, if
x < y =⇒f(x) < f(y).
Similarly, f is decreasing if x < y implies f(x) ≥f(y) and strictly decreasing if
x < y implies f(x) > f(y). A function is monotone if it is increasing or decreasing.
The same is the case for strictly monotone. Clearly, a function f is increasing iff −f
is decreasing, so any theorem about increasing functions has a companion theorem
for decreasing functions.
Exercise 5.1.1. If f : I →R is increasing, x,y ∈I, and f(x) < f(y), then x < y.
Exercise 5.1.2. If f : I →R is increasing and a ∈I, then f(a) is an upper bound for
{f(x) | x < a} and limx↗a f(x) = sup{f(x) | x < a}.
Similarly, if f is increasing, then f(a) is a lower bound for {f(x) | a < x} and
limx↘a f(x) = inf{ f(x) | a < x}. Consequently,
lim
x↗a f(x) ≤f(a) ≤lim
x↘a f(x).

5 Continuity
Hence, an increasing function is continuous at a iff
lim
x↗a f(x) = lim
x↘a f(x).
As mentioned above, a similar discussion applies to decreasing functions.
If f is a (not necessarily increasing) function, the one-sided limits at a exist, and
lim
x↗a f(x) ̸= lim
x↘a f(x),
then f has a jump discontinuity at a. Endpoints of an interval are special, because
at an endpoint there only in one one-sided limit. For example, if f : [a,b] →R, the
one-sided limit at a exists and
f(a) ̸= lim
x↘a f(x),
then f has a jump discontinuity at a. The previous discussion shows
Theorem 5.1.3. Let I be an interval and suppose f : I →R is monotone. Let a ∈I.
Then f is discontinuous at a iff f has a jump discontinuity at a.
Corollary 5.1.4. A monotone function has a countable, perhaps empty, set of dis-
continuities.
Proof. Suppose f is increasing. Let A be the set of discontinuities. If a ∈A, then
limx↗a f(x) < limx↘a f(x), since f is increasing and discontinuous at a. Consider
the open interval Ia :=

limx↗a f(x),limx↘a f(x)

. If a′ < a, then limx↘a′ f(x) ≤
f

a+a′
2

≤limx↗a f(x), hence the intervals Ia′ and Ia are disjoint. By density of
the rationals, each Ia contains a rational number ra. If a ̸= a′, then ra ̸= ra′, since
Ia ∩Ia′ is empty. Consequently, an enumeration of the rationals {ra | a ∈A} gives an
enumeration of A. Thus A is countable.

Example 5.1.5. Let ak, k = 1,2,... be an enumeration of the rationals in the open
interval ]0,1[. Consider the function determined by f(0) = 0 and if 0 < x ≤1 then
f(x) = ∑
k,ak<x
1
2k =
∞
∑
j=1
1
2k j ,
where kj = kj(x) is the subsequence of subscripts k for which ak < x. Then, f is
an increasing function mapping the closed interval [0,1] into itself and f is dis-
continuous at every rational and is the open interval with endpoints 0 and 1. Note,
f(1) = ∑∞
k=1
1
2k = 1.
Proof. If x < y, then f(y) −f(x) = ∑k,x≤ak<y

2k . Clearly, limx↗a j f(x) ≤f(aj) =
∑k,ak<a j

2k and limx↘a j f(x) ≥∑k,ak≤a j

2k . Hence, limx↘a j f(x) −limx↗a j f(x) ≥

2 j . It is easy to show that this is an equality, but we do not need that.

5.1 Monotone Functions
79
The following result, characterizing continuity of a monotone function, is the
main result in this section.
Theorem 5.1.6 (Continuity Theorem for Monotone Functions). A monotone func-
tion deﬁned on an interval is continuous iff its range is an interval.
Proof. Let I be an interval and let f : I →R be increasing.
⇐=: Suppose the range of f is an interval J. Let x0 ∈I. Let ε > 0 be given.
Suppose x0 is not the left endpoint of I.
(a) If f(x0)−ε ∈J, then there is an x1 ∈I such that f(x1) = f(x0)−ε. f(x1) <
f(x0) implies x1 < x0. Hence, x1 < x < x0 implies f(x0) −ε ≤f(x) ≤f(x0). (b)
If f(x0) −ε /∈J, then f(x0) −ε < f(x) ≤f(x0) for all x ∈I with x < x0. Fix any
x1 < x0 in I, then x1 < x < x0 implies f(x0)−ε < f(x) ≤f(x0). Hence, both in case
(a) and in (b) we have shown that limx↗x0 f(x) = f(x0).
Similarly, if x0 is not the right hand endpoint of I, then limx↘x0 f(x) = f(x0).
Consequently, f is continuous at x0.
=⇒: Suppose f is continuous. We will show that the range of f has the interme-
diate value property. Let x0,y0 ∈I and let t ∈R such that f(x0) < t < f(y0). We must
show that t is in the range of f. Since f(x0) < f(y0) and f is increasing x0 < y0. Let
A := {a ∈I | f(a) < t}
B := {b ∈I | t ≤f(b)}.
Clearly, x0 ∈A, y0 ∈B, A ∩B = /0, and A ∪B = I. Since f is increasing, y0 is an
upper bound for A. Hence, p := sup(A) is ﬁnite. Similarly, q := inf(B) is ﬁnite.
Exercise 5.1.7. A and B have the intermediate value property.
By the Interval Theorem A and B are intervals. Hence A is a subinterval of I and
p = sup(A), so A = I∩] −∞, p] or A = I∩] −∞, p[. Similarly, B = I ∩[q,∞[ or
B = I∩]q,∞[. Since A ∪B = I, and I has the intermediate value property p = q.
By deﬁnition of A, limx↗p f(x) ≤t and by deﬁnition of B, limx↘p f(x) ≥t. So con-
tinuity of f at p, implies f(p) = t.
The case where f is decreasing is most simply dealt with by observing that g =
−f is increasing.

The =⇒part of the Continuity Theorem for Monotone Functions is a special
case of the Intermediate Value Theorem (Theorem 5.2.2).
By the Interval Theorem:
Corollary 5.1.8. A monotone function deﬁned on an interval is continuous iff its
range has the intermediate value property.
If f is a strictly monotone function, then f is 1−1, hence f has an inverse function
f −1.
Exercise 5.1.9. The inverse of a strictly increasing function is strictly increasing.
Corollary 5.1.10. The inverse of a strictly monotone continuous function deﬁned on
an interval is continuous.

80
5 Continuity
Proof. Let I be an interval and suppose f : I →R is a strictly increasing and contin-
uous. The range of f is an interval J. The inverse function f −1 is strictly increasing
and maps J onto the interval I. Hence, f −1 is continuous.

The following exercise gives another proof of the existence of roots, Theorem
3.5.1.
Exercise 5.1.11. Let n ∈N. f : [0,∞[→R be determined by f(x) := xn. Prove
1. f is strictly increasing
2. The range of f is the interval [0,∞[
3. g(x) := x1/n is continuous: [0,∞[→[0,∞[
5.2 The Intermediate Value Theorem
Solving equations of the form f(x) = 0 plays a large role in mathematics. For ex-
ample, the existence of the nth root of a > 0 is equivalent to the equation xn −a = 0
having a solution. The Intermediate Value Theorem leads to another proof of the ex-
istence of roots. In fact, the proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem is remarkably
similar to our proof, that roots exists, i.e., to the proof of Theorem 3.5.1.
The Intermediate Value Theorem is a slight extension of a theorem due to Bern-
hard Placidus Johann Nepomuk Bolzano (5 October 1781 Prague to 18 December
1848 Prague). Contrary to most mathematicians of his era, Bolzano believed intu-
itive ideas, for example time and motion, do not belong in mathematics. Conse-
quently, he was one of the ﬁrst mathematician to insist on rigor in mathematics.
Bolzano's notion of a limit was similar to the modern one. Since Bolzano's work
predates Weierstrass' by some 50 years, perhaps we should have credited our deﬁ-
nition of limits to Bolzano.
Theorem 5.2.1 (Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem). Let I be an interval
and let f : I →R be a continuous function. If there are points a and b in I, such that
f(a) < 0 and f(b) > 0, then there is a point c in the open interval with endpoints a
and b, such that f(c) = 0.
Proof. Suppose a < b. Let a0 := a and b0 := b. Then, f(a0) < 0 and f(b0) > 0.
Let c0 := (a0 + b0)/2 be the midpoint of [a0,b0]. If f(c0) = 0, we are done. If
f(c0) ≤0, let a1 := c0 and b1 := b0. If f(c0) > 0, let a1 := a0 and b1 := c0. In either
case, f(a1) ≤0 and f(b1) > 0. Continuing in this manner, we get an and bn such
that, for all n, f(an) ≤0, f(bn) > 0, and for all n, cn := (an +bn)/2, and an+1 = an
and bn = cn or an+1 = cn and bn+1 = bn. Hence, for some real number c
∞

n=0
[an,bn] = {c}.
Since f(an) ≤0 for all n, f(c) = limn→∞f(an) ≤0. Similarly, f(bn) > 0 for all n,
implies f(c) = limn→∞f(bn) ≥0. Consequently, f(c) = 0.


5.3 Continuous Images of Compact Intervals
81
The proof gives a method for approximating the value of c. At any stage c is be-
tween an and bn. Hence, |c−cn| ≤(b−a)/2n+1. See the remark following Theorem
3.5.1.
Theorem 5.2.2 (Intermediate Value Theorem). If a real valued function f is con-
tinuous on some interval I, then the image f (I) of that interval has the intermediate
value property.
Proof. Let a < b be in I. Let y0 be between f(a) and f(b). If f(a) < f(b) apply
Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem to g(x) := f(x) −y0. If f(a) > f(b) apply
Bolzano't Intermediate Value Theorem to g(x) := y0 −f(x).

Corollary 5.2.3. If a real valued function f is a continuous on some interval I, then
f(I) is an interval.
This gives another proof of one part of the Continuity Theorem for Monotone Func-
tions (Theorem 5.1.6).
Exercise 5.2.4. Let I be an interval and f : I →R be continuous. Supposing f is
1−1, prove f is strictly monotone on I.
5.3 Continuous Images of Compact Intervals
Suppose a < b are real numbers. Let I := [a,b] be the corresponding closed interval.
We will call intervals of this form as compact intervals. If f : [a,b] →R is con-
tinuous, then it follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem that J := f(I) is an
interval. The endpoints of the interval f(I) are
inf(f(I)) = inf{f(x) | x ∈I} and
sup(f(I)) = sup{f(x) | x ∈I}.
In this section we will show that inf(f(I)) and sup( f(I)) are real numbers in the
range of f, consequently
f ([a,b]) = [inf(f([a,b]),sup(f ([a,b]))].
In particular, continuous functions map compact intervals onto compact intervals.
The proof is divided into two steps. The ﬁrst step, The Global Boundedness The-
orem, shows that inf(f(I)) and sup(f(I)) are real numbers. The second step, The
Extreme Value Theorem, shows that inf(f(I)) and sup(f(I)) are contained in the
interval f(I).
The following examples illustrate some of the reasons we consider compact in-
tervals I.
Example 5.3.1. If f(x) := 1
x and I :=]0,1[, then f (I) =]1,∞[. While the endpoints
of I are real numbers, the right hand endpoint of f(I) is not a real number.

82
5 Continuity
Example 5.3.2. If f(x) := x2 and I :=]−2,1[, then f(I) = [0,4[. A continuous image
of a an open interval need not be an open interval.
Global Boundedness Theorem
A function f : D →C is bounded on E ⊆D, if there is an M, such that |f(z)| ≤M
for all z ∈E. If f is real valued this means that −M ≤f(z) ≤M for all z ∈E. The
Local Boundedness Theorem for limits states that if limx→a f(x) exists, then f is
bounded near a. Consequently, if f is continuous at a, then f is bounded near a.
Theorem 5.3.3 (Global Boundedness Theorem). Let I be compact interval. If f :
I →C is continuous on I, then f is bounded on I.
Proof. Suppose f is not bounded. Bisect I. If f is bounded in both halves of I, then
f is bounded on I. Hence, f is unbounded in at least one of the two halves of I.
Repeating this argument we get a sequence of nested intervals In+1 ⊂In, such
that f is unbounded in each of the intervals In. By the Nested Interval Theorem, the
intersection In of these intervals contains exactly one point, call this point x0.
We will show f is bounded on one of the intervals In obtained by bisection. Note
f is continuous at x0. By Local Boundedness, f is bounded on the open interval
]x0 −δ,x0 + δ[, for some δ. For sufﬁciently large n, the interval In is a subset of
]x0 −δ,x0 + δ[, this is Exercise 3.3.3. On these intervals f is both bounded (by
choice of δ) and unbounded (by construction of In). This contradiction completes
the proof.

Exercise 5.3.4. Let I and J be compact intervals. Suppose f : I ×J →C is continu-
ous. Show f is bounded.
Extreme Value Theorem
If a function has a largest value, then that value is called the maximum of the func-
tion. Similarly, a smallest value, if it exists, is called a minimum. These notions are
important enough that we will also write them out using symbols. Let f : D →R be
a function. If xmax ∈D is a point such that
f(x) ≤f(xmax) for all x ∈D,
then f(xmax) is a global maximum of f. Similarly, f(xmin) is a global minimum of
f, if
f(xmin) ≤f(x) for all x ∈D.
Theorem 5.3.5 (Extreme Value Theorem). Let I be a compact interval. If f : I →
R is continuous on I, then there are xmin and xmax in I, such that

5.4 Uniform Continuity
83
f(xmin) ≤f(x) ≤f(xmax), for all x ∈I.
Proof. Let M := sup(f(I)). Since f is bounded, M is a real number. Bisect I. If the
supremum of f on both halves is < M, then the supremum of f over all of I is < M.
Hence, we can choose a half of I, such that the supremum of f over that half is M.
Repeating this argument we get a nested sequence of intervals In, such that the
supremum of f over each interval In is M. By the Nested Interval Theorem, the
intersection of these intervals contains exactly one real number. Call this number
x0.
We will show that f(x0) = M. That is xmax = x0. We know f(x) ≤M, for all
x ∈I. In particular, f(x0) ≤M. Suppose f(x0) < M. Let ε := (M −f(x0))/2. Then
ε > 0 and f(x0) + ε < M. Since, f is continuous at x0, there is a δ > 0, such that
|x −x0| < δ implies |f(x) −f(x0)| < ε. Hence, x ∈]x0 −δ,x0 + δ[ implies f(x) <
f(x0) + ε < M. (Compare the argument in this paragraph to the proof of Local
Positivity.)
Pick N, such that IN ⊂]x0 −δ,x0 +δ[. Then
M = sup{f(x) | x ∈IN}
≤sup{f(x) | x ∈]x0 −δ,x0 +δ[}
≤f(x0)+ε
< M.
This contradiction shows that f(x0) = M. The existence of xmin can be established
in a similar fashion, or by applying the existence of xmax to g = −f.

Corollary 5.3.6. If f : [a,b] →R is continuous and xmin and xmax are point in [a,b],
such that f(xmin) ≤f(x) ≤f(xmax) for all x ∈[a,b], then
f([a,b]) = [ f(xmin), f(xmax)].
Proof. By assumption f([a,b]) ⊆[f(xmin), f(xmax)]. The reverse inclusion ⊇is a
consequence of the Intermediate Value Theorem.

Exercise 5.3.7. Let I and J be compact intervals. Suppose f : I ×J →R is continu-
ous. Show there are (xmin,ymin) and (xmax,ymax) in I ×J, such that
f(xmin,ymin) ≤f(x,y) ≤f(xmax,ymax), for all (x,y) ∈I ×J.
5.4 Uniform Continuity
A function f : D →C is uniformly continuous on D, if given any ε > 0, there is a
δ > 0, such that for all x,y in D, |x−y| < δ =⇒| f(x)−f(y)| < ε. In symbols,
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0.∀x,y ∈D,|x−y| < δ =⇒| f(x)−f(y)| < ε.

84
5 Continuity
Note δ = δ(ε) only depends on ε.
Comparing this to f being continuous on D :
∀x ∈D,∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀y ∈D,|x−y| < δ =⇒| f(x)−f(y)| < ε.
We see that here δ = δ(x,ε) can depend on both x and ε. So uniform continuity
means that the same δ works for all x, the choice of δ is uniform in x.
Remark 5.4.1. At this point uniform continuity is a concept without applications.
However, we will need uniform continuity to show that continuous functions are
integrable later.
Example 5.4.2. Let f(z) := z2. Then f is uniformly continuous on D := {z ∈C |
|z| < 7}.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. For any w,z ∈D,
|f(w)−f(z)| = |w2 −z2| = |w+z||w−z| < 14|w−z|
hence |w−z| < ε/14 implies |f(w)−f(z)| < ε. Consequently, δ := ε/14.

Example 5.4.3. f :]0,1[→R determined by f(x) := 1/x is not uniformly continuous.
Proof. Let ε := 1. Let δ > 0 be small, say < 1/2. For 0 < x < 1/2, let y := x+δ.
Note x and y both are in ]0,1[. We want to choose x, such that
f(x)−f(y) = 1
x −
1
x+δ ≥1.
Now
1
x −
1
x+δ =
δ
x(x+δ).
Hence, we just need x such that δ ≥x(x+δ), that is, such that
0 ≥x2 +δx−δ.
One way to do this is to solve the equality for x, using the quadratic formula or
equivalently, by factoring the quadratic. Another is trial and error. Guessing x = δ/2,
and using 0 < δ < 1 =⇒δ 2 < δ, we get
x2 +δx−δ = 3
4δ 2 −δ < 3
4δ −δ < 0.

Example 5.4.4. Let A be a subset of C. Let DA(x) := inf{|x −a| | a ∈A} be the
distance from x ∈C to A. Then DA is uniformly continuous on C.
Proof. By the triangle inequality
DA(x) ≤|x−a| ≤|x−y|+|y−b|+|b−a|.

5.4 Uniform Continuity
85
for all a,b in A. Setting a = b on the right hand side, gives
DA(x) ≤|x−y|+|y−b|
for all b ∈A. Taking the inﬁmum over b ∈A gives
DA(y) ≤|x−y|+DA(y).
Hence DA(x)−DA(y) ≤|x−y|. Interchanging the roles of x and y leads to
|DA(x)−DA(y)| ≤|x−y|.
Consequently, setting δ := ε veriﬁes uniform continuity of DA.

Lemma 5.4.5. Let f : [0,1] →C be continuous. Suppose f is uniformly continu-
ous on I1 := [0,1/2], on I2 := [1/4,3/4], and on I3:=[1/2,1]. Then f is uniformly
continuous on [0,1].
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. For each j = 1,2,3, pick a uniform continuity δj > 0
corresponding to ε on Ij. Let δ := min{δ1,δ2,δ3,1/2}. Let x,y ∈[0,1] with |x−y| <
δ. |x −y| < δ ≤1/2 implies x,y ∈Ij for, at least, one of the three j's. For that j,
|x−y| < δ ≤δ j implies |f(x)−f(y)| < ε.

The main result is this section is:
Theorem 5.4.6 (Uniform Continuity Theorem). Let f : [a,b] →C be continuous
on [a,b], then f is uniformly continuous on [a,b].
Proof. Let f : [a,b] →R be continuous on [a,b]. Suppose f is not uniformly contin-
uous on [a,b]. Let ε0 > 0 be such that there is no corresponding uniform continuity
δ on [a,b]. By the proof of Lemma 5.4.5, there is no uniform continuity δ corre-
sponding to ε0 on one, or more, of the three "halves" of [a,b]. Setting a1 := a and
b1 := b and repeating this argument, we get, for each n ∈N, an and bn such that
[an+1,bn+1] ⊂[an,bn], bn+1 −an+1 = (bn −an)/2, and there is no uniform continu-
ity δ corresponding to ε0 on [an,bn].
Since the the intervals [an,bn] are nested and bn −an = (b−a)/2n−1 is null, the
Nested Interval Theorem produces an x0 such that
∞

n=1
[an,bn] = {x0}.
By assumption, f is continuous at x0. So since ε0/2 > 0, there is a δ0 > 0, such that
∀x ∈[a,b],|x−x0| < δ0 =⇒| f(x)−f(x0)| < ε0/2.
Let N be large enough that [aN,bN] ⊂]x0 −δ0,x0 +δ0[. Then for all x,y ∈[aN,bN],
|x−x0| < δ0 and |y−x0| < δ0, hence
|f(x)−f(y)| ≤| f(x)−f(x0)|+|f(x0)−f(y)| < ε0
2 + ε0
2 = ε0.

86
5 Continuity
Therefore, x,y ∈[aN,bN] =⇒| f(x)−f(y)| < ε0. Thus any δ > 0, for example δ :=
1, is a uniformly continuity δ corresponding to ε0 on [aN,bN]. But this contradicts
the construction of [an,bn].
Exercise 5.4.7. If f : [a,b] × [c,d] →C is continuous on [a,b] × [c,d], then f is
uniformly continuous on [a,b]×[c,d].
Problems
Problems for Sect. 5.1
1. Modify the deﬁnition of f in Problem 2 for Sect. 2.1 in such at way that the
modiﬁed f is strictly increasing, yet still has the same continuity/discontinuity
properties as the original f.
2. Let f : [−1/2,1/2] →R be determined by f(x) = σ(x), where σ is the pseudo-
sine function. Show that f is strictly increasing and the range of f is [−1,1].
Consequently, there is a continuous g : [−1,1] →[−1/2,1/2] such that g◦
f(x) = x and f ◦g(y) = y for x ∈[−1/2,1/2]and y ∈[−1,1]. Give a formula
for g.
3. Let f : [a,b] →R satisfy x < y =⇒f(x) ≤f(y). For each x ∈[a,b[ let f (x+) :=
limt↘x f(t), for each x ∈]a,b] let f (x−) := limt↗x f(t), f (b+) := f (b), and
f (a−) := f (a). For each x in [a,b], let
J(x) := f (x+)−f (x−).
Completing the following steps gives an alternative proof of the fact that a mono-
tone functions is discontinuous on a countable set.
a. Prove J(x) ≥0 for all x ∈[a,b].
b. f is discontinuous at x iff J(x) > 0.
c. If a ≤x < y ≤b, then f (x+) ≤f (y−).
d. For each x ∈[a,b], let Sx := {y ∈R | f (x−) < y < f (x+)}. Thus, Sx is ei-
ther empty or an open interval. Show Sx is a subset of the closed interval
[f (a), f (b)] and that if x ̸= y, then Sx ∩Sy = /0.
e. ∑x∈[a,b] J(x) ≤f (b)−f (a).
f. The set {x ∈[a,b] | J(x) > 0} is countable.
4. The Cantor function (deﬁned in Exercise 3.6.1) is increasing and continuous.
The Devil's Staircase is the continuous function g : [0,1] →[0,1] which agrees
with the Cantor function on the Cantor set and is constant on the intervals that are
deleted in the construction of the Cantor set. Below are two constructions of the
Devil's Staircase:

Let f denote the Cantor function.
1. The function g : [0,1] →[0,1] is determined by g(x) := f(x) when x ∈C. If x /∈C,
then x /∈Ck for some k. Hence, x is in one of the deleted intervals, let y be the left
hand endpoint of that interval and set g(x) := f(y).
2. Alternatively, suppose x = 0.

y = 0.
3d1d2 ...dn−12, where dj ̸= 1 for 1 ≤j < n, and dn = 1. Then g(x) := f(y).
Problems for Sect. 5.2
1. Let f : [0,1] →[0,1] be continuous. There is a c ∈[0,1], such that f(c) = c. [Hint:
Consider g(x) := x−f(x).] A point c such that f(c) = c is called a ﬁxed point.
2. Let p(x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + ··· + a1x + a0 where the ak's are real and n ∈N is

3. Let a > 0 be a real number and let n ∈N. Use Bolzano's Intermediate Value
Theorem to show that a1/n exists.
4. If I and J are intervals and f : I ×J →R is continuous, then the range of f is an
interval. [Hint: (a) One way to prove this is to imitate the proof above: Suppose
f(a,b) < 0 and f(c,d) > 0. Construct nested intervals [an,bn] and [cn,dn] such
that f(an,cn) ≤0 and f(bn,dn) > 0. Then show f(x0,y0) = 0 if ∞
n=1[an,bn] =
{x0} and ∞
n=1[cn,dn] = {y0}. (b) Another way it to use Bolzano's Intermediate

5 Continuity
a. Prove f does not have a minimum on R.
b. Prove f has a maximum on R.
2. Let p be a polynomial of even degree > 0. Show that p has a maximum or a
minimum, but not both.
3. If f : [a,b] →C is continuous, then g(x) := |f(x)| has a maximum on I := [a,b].
4. Let I0 := [0,1] and 0 < c < 1. Suppose f : I0 →I0 is a function satisfying
|f(x)−f(y)| ≤c|x−y|, for all x,y ∈I0.
Inductively, let In+1 := f (In) for integers n ≥0. Prove:
a. In+1 ⊆In for all n ≥0.
b. The length of In is ≤cn.
c. By the Nested Interval Theorem ∞
n=0 In contains exactly one point. If {x0} =
∞
n=0 In, then f (x0) = x0.
Comment on this problem: The existence of a ﬁxed points f (x0) = x0 is a
simple consequence of the Intermediate Value Theorem, see the Problems for
Sect. 5.2. The point of this problem is: if y0 is any point in I0, and inductively
yn+1 := f (yn), then |yn −x0| ≤cn. In particular, the sequence (yn) converges
to the ﬁxed point x0 and the rate of convergence is controlled by cn.
Problems for Sect. 5.4

I ∩]−∞,a] and I2 := [a,∞[. Suppose f is uniformly continuous on the intervals
I1 and I2. Show f is uniformly continuous on I.
Combining the previous three problems it follows that x →√x is uniformly con-
tinuous on [0,∞[.
4. Show f(x) := x2 is not uniformly continuous on [1,∞[.

uniformly continuous on D.
A function f satisﬁes a Hölder condition of order α, if there are constants α > 0
and M > 0, such that
|f(x)−f(y)| ≤M|x−y|α for all x and y.
The function is said to be α−Hölder with constant M. We say f is Hölder, if f is
α-Hölder for some α > 0.

continuous on R.
Solutions and Hints for the Exercises
Exercise 5.1.1. Contraposition on the deﬁnition of increasing. Since x = y implies
f(x) = f(y).
Exercise 5.1.2. Let L := sup{ f(x) | x < a}. Let ε > 0. Then L−ε is not an upper
bound for {f(x) | x < a}, hence there is a y < a such that L−ε < f(y). Let δ := a−y,
then δ > 0 and a−δ < x < a implies |f(x)−L| < ε.
Exercise 5.1.7. Suppose x < y < z and x,z are in A. We must show y is in A. Since
f is increasing and z is in A, we have f(y) ≤f(z) < t. Thus, y is in A. Similarly, B
has the intermediate value property.
Exercise 5.1.9. This is Exercise 5.1.1.
Exercise 5.1.11. (1) Exercise D.1.20. (2) Follows from xn →∞as x →∞and the
Continuity Theorem for Monotone Functions. (3) Corollary 5.1.10.
Exercise 5.2.4. Since f is 1 −1, x ̸= y =⇒f(x) ̸= f(y). Fix points a < b in I.
Suppose f(a) < f(b). Let x be in I. If x < a, then f(x) > f(a) and the Intermediate
Value Theorem leads to a contradiction that f is 1−1. Hence, x < a implies f(x) <
f(a) < f(b). Similarly a < x < b implies f(a) < f(x) < f(b) and b < x implies
f(a) < f(b) < f(x). Suppose y < z. (i) If y < z < a, setting x = z shows f(z) < f(a).
So replacing x < a < b by y < z < a shows f(y) < f(z)..(ii) If y < a < z, considering
x = y and x = z in the argument above shows f(y) < f(a) < f(z), hence f(y) < f(z).
The last case (iii) a < y < z is similar. Hence, if f(a) < f(b), then f is strictly
increasing. Similarly, if f(a) > f(b), then f is strictly decreasing.
Exercise 5.3.4. If f is not bounded on I × J divide the rectangle I × J into four
sub-rectangles, f must be unbounded on at least one of these sub-rectangles ...
Exercise 5.3.7. Divide the rectangle I ×J into four sub-rectangles, the supremum
of f over at least one of these sub-rectangle must equal the supremum of f over
I ×J ...
Exercise 5.4.7. Begin by extending Lemma 5.4.5 to rectangles. Then mimic the
proof of the Uniform Continuity Theorem.

Chapter 6
Derivatives and Their Applications
Local properties algebra derivatives and the relationship between the sign of the
derivative at a point and the function being monotone at a point. Global properties
of the derivative include Rolle's Theorem, the Mean Value Theorem (MVT), and
Darboux's Theorem. Applications include Taylor polynomials, l'Hopital's rule, Li-
ouville's theorem about transcendental numbers, and some aspects of convex func-
tion theory.
6.1 Deﬁnition
Let D be a subset of C. A function f : D →C is differentiable at a ∈D, if a is an
accumulation point of D and there is a complex number f ′(a), such that
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
→f ′(a) as x →a.
The number f ′(a) is called the derivative of f at a. We can rewrite the deﬁnition of
derivative as: f is differentiable at a with derivative b, if given any ε > 0, there is a
δ > 0, such that
0 < |x−a| < δ =⇒

f(x)−f(a)
x−a
−b
 < ε.
When f is differentiable at a with derivative b we set f ′(a) := b. Anticipating the
application of limits to derivatives is one of the reasons we used 0 < |x−a| < δ and
not |x−a| < δ in the deﬁnition of limits.
The line y = f(a)+ f ′(a)(x−a) is called the tangent to the curve y = f(x) at the
point (a, f (a)). See Fig. 6.1.
Example 6.1.1. Let f(x) := √x and a > 0. Then f is differentiable at a and f ′(a) =
1
2√a.

6 Derivatives and Their Applications
Fig. 6.1 The curve y = f(x), line segments connecting the point (a, f(a)) to the point (x, f(x)) for
several values of x, and the tangent line y = f(a)+ f ′(a)(x−a)
Proof. Essentially, this is a calculation verifying g(x) := f(x)−f(a)
x−a
has a removable
discontinuity at a.
√x−√a

√x+√a
→
1
√a+√a as x →a.
Hence, f ′(a) = 1/(2√a).

We say that f is differentiable on D, if f ′(a) exists for all a ∈D. In particular,
f(x) = √x is differentiable on ]0,∞[ and its derivative is f ′(x) =
1
2√x.
Example 6.1.2. Let f(x) := 1/x and let a be any complex number ̸= 0. Then f ′(a) =
−1/a2.
Proof. This is similar to the previous example. In fact,

6.2 Local Properties
93
Using one-sided limits (Sect. 1.5) we can similarly deﬁne one-sided derivatives.
The right-hand derivative (the derivative from the right) f ′+(a) is
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
→f ′+(a) as x ↘a.
Similarly, the left-hand derivative (the derivative from the left) f ′−(a) is
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
→f ′−(a) as x ↗a.
Using a basic fact about one-sided limits: f ′(a) exists iff f ′−(a) and f ′+(a) both
exists and are equal.
Example 6.1.3. Let f(x) := √x and a := 0. Then
√x−

x−0
=
√x
x

√x
→∞as x ↘0.
Hence, f ′+(0) does not exist.
Example 6.1.4. The pseudo-sine function σ from Example 1.3.10 is differentiable
at 0 with σ′(0) = 4.
Proof. Clearly,
σ(x)−σ(0)

= 4(1−x) when 0 < x < 1.
and 4(1−x) →4 as x ↘0. Hence σ′+(0) = 4. Similarly,
σ(x)−σ(0)
x−0
= 4(1+x) →4 as x ↗0,
hence, σ′−(0) = 4. Since, σ′+(0) = 4 = σ′−(0), we conclude σ is differentiable at
0 and σ′(0) = 4.

6.2 Local Properties
The following result shows that a differentiable function is continuous. We establish
this at a point. Hence, if f is differentiable at all points in some set D, then f is
continuous on D.
Theorem 6.2.1. If f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.

Proof. This is a consequence of the Product Rule for limits and continuity of g(x) :=
x.
f(x)−f(a) = f(x)−f(a)
x−a
(x−a) →f ′(a)·0 = 0 as x →a.
Hence, f(x) →f(a) as x →a.

In the remaining part of this section we assume f be a real valued function de-
ﬁned in some open interval containing a.
We say f is increasing at a point a, if there is a δ > 0, such that f(x) ≤f(a),
when a−δ < x < a and f(a) ≤f(x), when a < x < x+δ. Strictly increasing at a is
deﬁned in the same way using < in place of ≤. Decreasing and strictly decreasing
at a point are deﬁned in a similar manner. Example 6.2.5 contains a function that is
both increasing at 0 and not strictly increasing at 0.
The following are direct consequences of the limit deﬁnition of the derivative.
The results illustrate why points where the tangent line is a horizontal line are im-
portant, i.e., why the roots of f ′(x) = 0 are important.
Exercise 6.2.2. Suppose f ′(a) exists and f is increasing at a. Prove f ′(a) ≥0.
Exercise 6.2.3. If f ′(a) exists and f ′(a) > 0, then f is strictly increasing at a.
f(a) is a local maximum of f, if there is a δ > 0, such that
a−δ < x < a+δ =⇒f(x) ≤f(a).
A local minimum is deﬁned similarly, replace ≤by ≥. f(a) is a local extremum, if
f(a) is a local maximum or a local minimum.
We say a is a critical point of f, if either f ′(a) = 0 or f is not differentiable at a.
The following exercise shows that the "candidates" for local extrema are the critical
points.
Exercise 6.2.4. If f(a) a local extremum and f ′(a) exists, then f ′(a) = 0.
We conclude this section with an example explaining why we distinguish between
increasing and strictly increasing at a point.
Example 6.2.5. Let σ be the pseudo-sine function. Let f(x) := x|σ(1/x)| if x ̸= 0
and f(0) := 0. Then f(x) ≥0 when x > 0, f(x) ≤0 when x ≤0, so f is increasing
at 0. Moreover, f(±1/n) = 0 for all n ∈N. Hence, f is not strictly increasing at 0.
Consequently, f is increasing but not strictly increasing at 0.
6.3 Calculating with Derivatives
If f is differentiable at a, then f(x)−f(a)
x−a
→f ′(a) as x →a, and if g is differentiable
at b, then g(y)−g(b)
y−b
→g′(b) as y →b. The calculations underlying the proofs in this
section are motivated by the desire to ﬁnd expressions of the form
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
and

g(y)−g(b)
y−b
as appropriate. That is, we are looking for expression we know converge
and we hope to somehow deal with whatever turns up as a result.
Algebra
We establish the standard rules for working with derivatives.
Theorem 6.3.1 (Constant Rule). Suppose k ∈C, a is an accumulation point of D,
and f : D →C is differentiable at a, then k f is differentiable at a and
(k f)′(a) = k f ′(a).
Proof. By assumption (f(x)−f(a))/(x−a) →f ′(a) as x →a, hence
(k f)(x)−(k f)(a)
x−a
= k f(x)−f(a)
x−a
→k f ′(a) as x →a,
by the constant rule for limits. Thus, k f is differentiable at a and (k f)′(a) = k f ′(a).

Theorem 6.3.2 (Sum Rule). Suppose a is an accumulation point of D and f,g :
D →C are differentiable at a, then f +g is differentiable at a and
(f +g)′(a) = f ′(a)+g′(a).
Proof. By assumption (f(x)−f(a))/(x−a) →f ′(a) and (g(x)−g′(a))/(x−a) →
g′(a) as x →a. Hence,
( f +g)(x)−(f +g)(a)
x−a
= f(x)−f(a)
x−a
+ g(a)−g(a)
x−a
→f ′(a)+g′(a) as x →a,
by the sum rule for limits. Thus, f +g is differentiable at a and (f +g)′(a) = f ′(a)+
g′(a).

A transformation f →L(f) where L(f) is some other function depending on f,
is called linear, if L(k f) = kL(f) and L(f +g) = L( f)+L(g) where k is a constant
and f and g are functions. Using this terminology, we can restate the Constant and
Sum Rules as: f →f ′ is linear.
The following result is sometimes called Leibniz' Rule after Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz (1 July 1646, Leipzig to 14 November 1716, Hanover.)
Theorem 6.3.3 (Product Rule). If a is an accumulation point of D and f,g : D →C
are differentiable at a, then fg is differentiable at a and
(fg)′(a) = f ′(a)g(a)+ f(a)g′(a).

96
6 Derivatives and Their Applications
Proof. By assumption (f(x)−f(a))/(x−a) →f ′(a) and (g(x)−g′(a))/(x−a) →
g′(a) as x →a. Hence,
( fg)(x)−(fg)(a)
x−a
= f(x)g(x)−f(a)g(a)
x−a
= f(x)−f(a)
x−a
g(x)+ f(a)g(x)−g(a)
x−a
→f ′(a)g(a)+ f(a)g′(a).
Where we used that g is continuous at a and the Product and Sum Rules for Limits.
Thus, fg is differentiable at a and (fg)′(a) = f ′(a)g(a)+ f(a)g′(a).

Having dealt with addition and multiplication, essentially inherited from arith-
metic, we turn to an operation intrinsic to functions.
Theorem 6.3.4 (Chain Rule). Suppose g : A →B is differentiable at a and f : B →C
is differentiable at g(a), then f ◦g is differentiable at a and
(f ◦g)′(a) = f ′(g(a))g′(a).
Proof. Let h(y) := ( f(y)−f(g(a))/(y−g(a)) for y ∈B. By our assumptions h(y) →
f ′(g(a)) as y →g(a) and (g(x)−g(x))/(x−a) →g′(a) as x →a. Let
j(x) := f ◦g(x)−f ◦g(a)
x−a
= f(g(x))−f(g(a))
x−a
on A\{a}.
We must show that j(x) →f ′(g(a))g′(a) as x →a.
We will use restrictions, see Sect. 1.4. Let
D1 := {x ∈A | g(x) ̸= g(a)} and
D2 := {x ∈A | g(x) = g(a)}.
Since a is an accumulation point of A, either a is an accumulation point of D1 or a
is an accumulation point of D2, or both.
Case 1: Suppose a is an accumulation point of D1. For x ∈D1
j

D1(x) = j(x) = f (g(x))−f(g(a))
g(x)−g(a)
g(x)−g(a)
x−a
= h(g(x)) g(x)−g(a)
x−a
.
Since g is differentiable at a, g is continuous at a, equivalently g(x) →g(a) as
x →a. Hence, by the Composition Rule for Limits h◦g

D1(x) →f ′(g(a)) as x →a.
Consequently, the Product Rule for Limits tells us that
j

D1(x) →f ′(g(a))g′(a) as x →a.

6.3 Calculating with Derivatives
97
Case 2: Suppose a is an accumulation point of D2. For x ∈D2
g(x)−g(a)
x−a
= g(a)−g(a)
x−a
= 0
hence g′(a) = 0. So, for x ∈D2
j

D2(x) = j(x) = f (g(x))−f(g(a))
x−a
= f(g(a))−f(g(a))
x−a
= 0
Since g′(a) = 0, we have
j

D2(x) →0 = f ′(g(a))g′(a) as x →a.
If a is not an accumulation point of D1 we can ignore Case 1, and if a is not an
accumulation of D2 we can ignore Case 2. If a is an accumulation point of D1 and
of D2, then Case 2 shows g′(a) = 0. Hence, both j

D1(x) →0 and j

D2(x) →0 as
x →a. Consequently,
j(x) →0 = f ′(g(a))g′(a).
In all cases, the limit of j(x) as x →a exists and equals f ′(g(a))g′(a). Hence j(x) →
f ′(g(a))g′(a) as x →a.

The following result can be proven in a manner similar to our proof of the Product
Rule. However, we will establish it as a consequence of the Product and Chain
Rules.
Theorem 6.3.5 (Quotient Rule). Suppose a is an accumulation point of D, f,g :
D →C are differentiable at a, and g(a) ̸= 0, then f/g is differentiable at a and
 f
g
′
(a) = f ′(a)g(a)−f(a)g′(a)
g(a)2
.
Proof. The Quotient Rule is a consequence of the Product Rule, the Chain Rule, and
Example 6.1.2. Suppose g is differentiable at a and that g(a) ̸= 0. Let h(x) := 1/x,
then h is differentiable at g(a) and h′(g(a)) = −1/g(a)2. Hence, by the Chain Rule,
1/g(x) = h◦g(x) is differentiable at a and

.
This calculation completes the proof.

Inverse Function Rule
Suppose f has an inverse function f −1. If f is differentiable at a and f −1 is differ-
entiable at b = f(a), then the Chain Rule implies that f −1 ◦f is differentiable at a,
and

f −1 ◦f
′ (a) =

f −1′ (f(a))· f ′(a).
But f −1 ◦f(x) = x for all x, so

f −1 ◦f
′ (a) = 1. Hence,

f −1′ (f(a)) =
1
f ′(a)
provided f ′(a) ̸= 0. We will show that this formula works without assuming f −1 is
differentiable.
Theorem 6.3.6 (Inverse Function Rule). Let I be an interval. Suppose f : I →R is
continuous and one-to-one. If f is differentiable at a and f ′(a) ̸= 0, then the inverse
function f −1 is differentiable at b := f(a), and

f −1′ (b) =
1
f ′ (f −1 (b)) =
1
f ′ (a).
Proof. The discussion prior to the statement of the theorem suggests we want to use
the Composition Rule for Limits.
Let
h(y) := f −1(y)−f −1(b)
y−b
for y ̸= b
we need to show that h(y) converges as y →b, the limit then equals

f −1′ (b).
Anticipating the formula for

f −1′ (b), let

(6.1)
Note x ̸= f −1(b) implies f(x) ̸= f

f −1(b)

x−f −1(b)

f −1(b)

̸= 0 as x →f −1(b).
Using the Quotient Rule for Limits we conclude g(x) →1/f ′ 
f −1(b)

as x →
f −1(b).
The second expression for g(x) in (6.1) shows that h(y) = g

f −1(y)

. Since
f −1(y) ̸= f −1(b) for all y ̸= b, the Composition Rule for Limits yields
h(y) = g

f −1(y)

→1/f ′ 
f −1(b)

as x →f −1(b),
provided f −1(y) →f −1(b) as y →b. Hence we need to show that f −1 is continuous
at b.
But we know that a 1 −1 continuous function on an interval must be strictly
monotone (Exercise 5.2.4), and that the inverse of a continuous strictly monotone
function deﬁned on an interval must be continuous (Corollary 5.1.10).

6.4 Global Properties of Derivatives
We will now change our viewpoint slightly. Instead of considering the derivative at a
single point a, we will consider f ′ as a function. f ′ : {all a where f ′(a) exists} →C,
or →R as appropriate. We can then ask questions about this function.
Let f : [a,b] →R be continuous. By the Extreme Value Theorem, there are xmax
and xmin in [a,b] such that
f(xmin) ≤f(x) ≤f(xmax) for all x ∈[a,b].
If xmin is in ]a,b[, then f(xmin) is a local minimum, hence f(xmin) is a critical point.
So, if f is differentiable at xmin, then f ′(xmin) = 0 (by Exercise 6.2.4). Consequently,
if f is differentiable on ]a,b[, then either f ′(xmin) = 0 or xmin is an endpoint of [a,b].
A similar discussion applies to xmax.
Exercise 6.4.1. If f(x) := x3 −6x2 +7 on [−2,2], ﬁnd xmin and xmax.
The Intermediate Value Theorem for Derivatives
Derivatives deﬁned on intervals have the intermediate value property, this result is
named after Jean-Gaston Darboux (14 August 1842, Nîmes to 23 February 1917,
Paris).
Theorem 6.4.2 (Darboux's Intermediate Value Theorem). Let f be a real valued
function. Suppose f is differentiable on some interval I, then f ′(I) has the interme-
diate value property.
Proof. Let a < b be in I and let k be between f ′(a) and f ′(b). If f ′(a) < k < f ′(b),
let g(x) := f(x)−kx. (If f ′(b) < k < f ′(a), let g(x) := kx−f(x).) Then g is continu-
ous on [a,b] and differentiable on [a,b]. Let xmin ∈[a,b] be such that g(xmin) ≤g(x)
for all x ∈[a,b]. Since g′(a) = f ′(a)−k < 0, g is strictly decreasing at a. In partic-
ular, a ̸= xmin. Similarly, g is increasing at b, hence b ̸= xmin. So a < xmin < b and
consequently, g′(xmin) = 0.

Remark 6.4.3. Because of the Intermediate Value Theorem for f ′, it is natural to ask
"If f ′ exists on some interval, must f ′ be continuous on that interval?" The answer
is no. The most natural way to see this is to use the integral, discussed in Chap. 7,
and set
f(x) :=
ˆ x
0
σ(1/t)dt
where σ is the pseudo-sine function, or accepting a more involved calculation, the
usual sine function (Sect. 11.2).
The following exercise uses a "clever guess" to get a simple example of a function
with a discontinuous derivative.

6.4 Global Properties of Derivatives
101
Exercise 6.4.4. Let
f(x) :=

xσ(1/x)
when x ̸= 0
0
when x = 0 ,
where σ is the pseudo-sine function. Then f is not differentiable at 0, because
limx→0 f(x)/x does not exist. Prove that g(x) := x f(x) is differentiable on R and
g′ is not continuous at 0.
The Mean Value Theorem
The essence of this important result is named after Michel Rolle (21 April 1652
Ambert to 8 November 1719 Paris) who gave the ﬁrst formal proof. The geometric
content of the result is that, if f(a) = f(b), then some tangent to the curve y = f(x),
a < x < b is horizontal, see Fig. 6.2.
Theorem 6.4.5 (Rolle's Theorem). Suppose g : [a,b] →R is differentiable on the
open interval ]a,b[ and continuous on the closed interval [a,b]. If g(a) = g(b), then
g′(c) = 0 for some c ∈]a,b[.
Proof. Let f(x) := g(x) −g(a). Then f(a) = f(b) = 0. If f(x) ̸= 0 for some x ∈
[a,b], then f(xmin) ̸= 0 or f(xmax) ̸= 0. So at least one of xmin and xmax is in the
open interval ]a,b[. Consequently, f ′(xmax) = 0 or f ′(xmin) = 0. Hence, c is xmin or
xmax.
If f(x) = 0 for all x, then c := (a+b)/2. Of course any other value c in the open
interval ]a,b[ would also work.

The full version of the MVT is obtained from Rolle's Theorem by a simple re-
duction. The reduction is illustrated in Fig. 6.3. Geometrically, the MVT states that
some tangent to the curve y = f(x), a < x < b is parallel to the line though the points
(a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)).
Fig. 6.3 The graphic on the left shows the curve y = f(x) and the line y = L(x) connecting the
endpoints (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) of the curve. The graphic on the right shows g(x) = f(x)−L(x)
and the x−axis. In this illustration a = 1, b = 4, and f(x) = x

Theorem 6.4.6 (The Mean Value Theorem). Suppose f : [a,b] →R is differen-
tiable on the open interval ]a,b[ and continuous on the closed interval [a,b], then
f ′(c) = f(b)−f(a)
b−a
for some c ∈]a,b[.
Proof. Let
L(x) := f(b)−f(a)
b−a
(x−a)+ f(a)
then L(a) = f(a) and L(b) = f(b). So we can apply Rolle's Theorem to g(x) :=
f(x)−L(x), to get a c in ]a,b[ such that g′(c) = 0 for some c ∈]a,b[. For that c
f ′(c) = L′(c) = f(b)−f(a)
b−a
.
This completes the proof.

The MVT has many application in analysis. The rest of this chapter is devoted to
exploring some of the consequences of this important theorem.
We showed earlier that the derivative of a constant function f(x) := k is f ′(x) = 0.
Conversely, the only solutions to the differential equation f ′(x) = 0 on an interval
are the constant functions.
Theorem 6.4.7. If f is differentiable on some interval I and f ′(x) = 0 for all x in I,
then there is a constant k, such that f(x) = k for all x in I.
Proof. Let a be in I. If x is in I and x ̸= a, then the Meal Value Theorem gives us a
c between a and x such that
f(x)−f(a)
x−a
= f ′(c) = 0.

Consequently, f(x) = f(a), so k := f(a).

Exercise 6.4.8. Let f and g be differentiable on some interval I. If f ′ = g′ on I, then
there is a constant k, such that f(x) = g(x)+k for all x in I.
Exercise 6.4.9. Let I be an interval, suppose f and g are differentiable on I. If
f ′(x) ≤g′(x) on ]a,b[ and c is in I, then
f(x)−f(c) ≤g(x)−g(c) for all x in I with c < x
and
f(x)−f(c) ≥g(x)−g(c) for all x in I with c > x.
Exercise 6.4.10. Let I be an interval and suppose f : I →R is differentiable. Prove
f is increasing on I iff f ′(x) ≥0 on I.
6.5 Transcendental Numbers⋆
In this section we use the MVT to solve a seemingly unrelated problem, more pre-
cisely we establish the existence of transcendental numbers.
A real number a is algebraic, if there is a polynomial p(x) = ∑n
k=0 akxk with
integer coefﬁcients ak, such that p(a) = 0. A real number a is algebraic of order n,
if the smallest degree of such a polynomial is n. A real number that is not algebraic
is transcendental.
In 1844, Joseph Liouville [24 March 1809, Saint-Omer to 8 September 1882,
Paris] constructed a family of transcendental numbers. Prior to this construction,
people suspected that numbers like e and π were transcendental, but the existence
of even one transcendental was in doubt. Of course, later Cantor showed that most
real numbers are transcendental by a nonconstructive argument. See the problems
for Sect. 4.1 for an outline of Cantor's argument.
Example 6.5.1. 2
3 is algebraic of order 1. To see this, let p(x) := 3x −2, clearly
p(2/3) = 0.
Similarly, any rational, other than 0, is algebraic of order 1. Clearly, 0 is algebraic
of order 0.
Example 6.5.2.
√
3 is algebraic of order 2. Since,
√
3 is not rational it is not alge-
braic of order 1. Considering p(x) = x2 −3, shows that
√
3 is algebraic of order 2.
Similarly, 21/3 is algebraic of order 3. Let p(x) := x3 −2.
The n = 1 case of the following theorem is Theorem 1.8.5.
Theorem 6.5.3 (Liouville). Let α be a real number. If
anαn +an−1αn−1 +a1α +a0 = 0,

104
6 Derivatives and Their Applications
for some natural number n and some integers ak with an ̸= 0, then there exists K > 0
such that for all p,q ∈Z with q > 0 either α = p/q, or
α −p
q
 ≥K
qn .
More poetically, an algebraic number is poorly approximated by rational numbers.
This is closely related to what is called the "irrationality measure" of a real number.
Proof. We reproduce Liouville's proof. Let f(t) := ∑n
k=0 aktk where the ak are inte-
gers. Then f(α) = 0. If f has a root other than α, let
δ := min{|α −x| | x ̸= α, f(x) = 0}.
The minimum exists and is > 0, since the set of roots is nonempty by assumption
and ﬁnite by Theorem 1.4.11. If f does not have any root other than α, set δ := 1.
In either case, δ > 0 and f(t) ̸= 0 for all t satisfying 0 < |α −t| < δ.
The derivative f ′(t) is a polynomial and therefore a continuous function. By the
Global Boundedness Theorem for continuous functions, there is an M > 0 such that
|f ′(t)| ≤M for all t ∈[α −δ,α +δ]. It remains to show that K := min{δ,1/M}
works.
Let p ∈Z and q ∈N be such that α ̸= p/q. If |α −p/q| ≥δ, then |α −p/q| ≥
δ ≥δ/qn ≥K/qn. Hence, we are done.
So, suppose |α −p/q| < δ. By construction of δ, we have f(p/q) ̸= 0. The
product qn f(p/q) is a nonzero integer, in fact,
qn f(p/q) = qn

6.6 Taylor Polynomials
Taylor's formula is named after Brook Taylor (18 August 1685, Edmonton to 29
December 1731, London). Taylor is by far not the ﬁrst to have used Taylor series,
for example, M¯adhava of Sañgam¯agrama (c. 1350 to c. 1425) made use of Taylor
series.
The remainder formula below is due to Joseph-Louis Lagrange (25 January 1736,
Turin to 10 April 1813, Paris). Another formula for the remainder is in the problems
for Sect. 7.5.
The nth derivative, f (n), of f is f differentiated n times. Inductively, f (0) := f
and for n ∈N0, f (n+1) :=

f (n)′
. In particular, f ′ = f (1), f ′′ = f (2), and f ′′′ = f (3).
We say f is C n on D, in symbols: f ∈C n(D), if f (n) exists at each point in D and
f (n) is continuous on D.
Theorem 6.6.1 (Taylor's Formula with Lagrange Remainder). Suppose f is real
valued and C n+1 on the closed interval with endpoints x and x0. Let
Tn f(x) = (Tn f)(x) :=
n
∑
k=0
f (k)(x0)
k!
(x−x0)k.
(6.5)

Then f(x) = Tn f(x)+Rn f(x), where
Rn f(x) = (Rn f)(x) = f (n+1)(c)
(n+1)! (x−x0)n+1
(6.6)
for some c between x0 and x.
Tn f is the nth Taylor polynomial for f at x0 and Rn f := f −Tn f is the remainder.
The formula (6.6) for the remainder is due to Lagrange. Note, the Lagrange form of
Rn f is not a polynomial in x of degree n+1, because c depends on x.
Taylor's Formula shows that
f(x) ≈Tn f(x) with error |Rn f(x)|.
A different formula for the remainder Rn f(x) can be found in the Problems for
Sect. 7.5.
In most applications of Taylor's Formula we do not know the value of c. How-
ever, this does not matter, if we can show that |Rn f(c)| is small by ﬁnding an esti-
mate for
f (n+1)(c)
.
Corollary 6.6.2. If f is real valued and C n+1 on the closed interval I with end
points x and x0, then
|Rn f(x)| ≤
Mn+1
(n+1)! |x−x0|n+1 .
where Mn+1 is a constant satisfying
f (n+1)(t)
 ≤Mn+1 for all t in the closed interval
with endpoints x and x0.
Remark 6.6.3. A polynomial of degree n equals its Taylor polynomials of degree
m ≥n. In fact, if f is a polynomial of degree n and m ≥n, then f (m+1) = 0. Hence,
Rm f = 0 and consequently Tn f = f.
Below are two proofs of Taylor's Formula. One proof is based on Exercise 6.4.9 and
the other is based on Cauchy's MVT.
Proof of Taylor's Formula using Exercise 6.4.9
We give the proof for n = 2. Let I be the closed interval with endpoints x and x0.
Since f (3) is continuous there is are constants m and M such that
m ≤f ′′′(t) ≤M
(6.7)
for all t ∈I and such that f ′′′ (tmin) = m and f ′′′ (tmax) = M for some tmin,tmax ∈I.

Suppose x0 < x. By Exercise 6.4.9 and (6.7)
m(t −x0) ≤f ′′ (t)−f ′′ (x0)
(6.8)
for all t ∈I, since (m(t −x0))′ = m ≤f ′′′(t) = ( f ′′ (t)−f ′′ (x0))′ . Similarly, by
Exercise 6.4.9 and (6.8)
1
2m(t −x0)2 ≤f ′ (t)−f ′ (x0)−f ′′ (x0)(t −x0)
(6.9)
for all t ∈I. Repeating the argument one more time gives
1
6m(t −x0)3 ≤f (t)−f (x0)−f ′ (x0)(t −x0)−1
2 f ′′ (x0)(t −x0)2
(6.10)
for all t ∈I. Similarly, using the other half of (6.7), we get
f (t)−f (x0)−f ′ (x0)(t −x0)−1
2 f ′′ (x0)(t −x0)2 ≤1
6M (t −x0)3
(6.11)
for all t ∈I. Setting t = x in (6.10) and (6.11) we conclude

f (x)−f (x0)−f ′ (x0)(x−x0)−1
2 f ′′ (x0)(x−x0)2
/(x−x0)3
(6.12)
is a number between m = f ′′′(tmin) and M = f ′′′(tmax). By the Intermediate Value
Theorem there is a c = c(t) between tmin and tmax, hence between x and x0, such
that (6.12) equals f ′′′(c). This completes the proof when x0 < x. The case x < x0 is
similar.
Proof of Taylor's Formula using Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem
The following slight generalization of the MVT is named after Augustin-Louis
Cauchy (21 August 1789, Paris to 23 May 1857, Sceaux). The usual MVT is ob-
tained by setting g(x) = x. The proof of the usual MVT above has a simple geomet-
ric interpretation. While the proof of Cauchy's MVT is a clever trick, the result has
a simple geometric interpretation.
Theorem 6.6.4 (Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem). Suppose real valued functions
f and g are differentiable on the open interval ]a,b[ and continuous on the closed
interval [a,b], then there is a point c in ]a,b[ such that
f ′(c)(g(b)−g(a)) = (f(b)−f(a))g′(c).
(6.13)
Proof. Let
φ(x) := ( f(b)−f(a))(g(x)−g(a))−(g(b)−g(a))(f(x)−f(a)).
Then φ is continuous on [a,b], differentiable on ]a,b[, and φ(a) = φ(b) = 0. So by
Rolle's Theorem φ ′(c) = 0 for some c in ]a,b[.

If at least one of f ′(c) and g′(c) is nonzero, then (6.13) means that the tangent
to the curve ϕ(t) := ( f(t),g(t)), a < t < b at the point ϕ(c) is parallel to the line
though the points ϕ(a) = (f(a),g(a)) and ϕ(b) = (f(b),g(b)).
Remark 6.6.5. The formula in the Cauchy's MVT remains true, if we interchange a
and b.
Proof. [Proof of Taylor's Formula with Lagrange Remainder] We will give the proof
for n = 3. Let
F(t) :=
n
∑
k=0
f (k)(t)

(x−t)k
= f(t)+ f ′(t)(x−t)+ 1
2 f ′′(t)(x−t)2 + 1
6 f (3)(t)(x−t)3.
When t = x, only the k = 0 term survives in the sum, hence F(x) = f(x). Clearly
F(x0) = Tn f(x). Hence F(x)−F(x0) = f(x)−Tn f(x) = Rn f(x). It remains to verify
(6.6).
By the product rule for derivatives (we set n = 3 to simplify this calculation)

Let G(t) := (x−t)n+1. Then G(x) = 0, G(x0) = (x−x0)n+1, and G′(t) = −(n+
1)(x−t)n. By Cauchy's MVT there is a c between x and x0 such that
F′(c)(G(x)−G(x0)) = (F(x)−F(x0))G′(c).
Consequently,
1
n! f (n+1)(c)(x−c)n 
0−(x−x0)n+1
= Rn f(x)(−(n+1)(x−c)n).
Rearranging the last equation gives the desired expression for Rn f(x).

Remark 6.6.6. Other choices of G leads to different formulas for the remainder. All
that is required of G is that it satisﬁes the assumptions in the Cauchy MVT and that
we do not divide by 0. Hence, any G that is continuous on the closed interval with
endpoints x and x0, is differentiable on the open interval with endpoints x and x0,
and whose derivative is nonzero on that interval gives a formula for the remainder.

Corollary 6.6.2.
As a direct consequence of Taylor's Formula we get a version of l'Hôpital's Rule.
Corollary 6.6.8 (l'Hôpital's Rule). If f,g are C n+1, f ( j)(x0) = g( j)(x0) = 0 for
0 ≤j < n and g(n)(x0) ̸= 0, then
f(x)
g(x) →f (n)(x0)
g(n)(x0)
as x →x0.
Proof. For simplicity of notation, suppose n = 1. Since f(x0) = g(x0) = 0, Taylor's
Formula applied to f and g gives
f(x) = f ′(x0)+ 1
2 f ′′(cx)(x−x0)2
g(x) = g′(x0)+ 1
2g′′(dx)(x−x0)2
for some cx and dx between x and x0.
Since cx and dx are between x and x0, we see that cx →x0 and dx →x0 as x →x0.
Hence continuity of f ′′ and g′′ at x0 guarantees f ′′(cx) →f ′′(x0) and g′′(dx) →
g′′(x0) as x →x0. Consequently,
f(x)
g(x) = f ′(x0)+ 1
2 f ′′(cx)(x−x0)2
g′(x0)+ 1
2g′′(dx)(x−x0)2 →f ′(x0)+ 1
2 f ′′(x0)(x0 −x0)2
g′(x0)+ 1
2g′′(x0)(x0 −x0)2 = f ′(x0)
g′(x0)
as x →x0.

A version of l'Hôpital's Rule that works under fewer assumptions on f and g
can be found in Sect. 6.7. The version above is sufﬁcient for most applications of
l'Hôpital's Rule.
6.7 l'Hôpital's Rule⋆
The rule is named after Guillaume François Antoine, Marquis de l'Hôpital (Paris
1661, Paris to 2 February 1704, Paris). Johann Bernoulli (27 July 1667 Basel to
1 January 1748 Basel) was hired by l'Hôpital to teach him mathematics. One part

110
6 Derivatives and Their Applications
of the arrangement allowed l'Hôpital to use Bernoulli's discoveries as he pleased.
l'Hôpital published a calculus book largely based on Bernoulli's work, including
what is commonly known as l'Hôpital's Rule.
Theorem 6.7.1 (l'Hôpital's Rule). Suppose f and g are differentiable on ]a,b[,
f(x) →0 and g(x) →0 as x ↘a, then
f ′(x)
g′(x) →L as x ↘a implies f(x)
g(x) →L as x ↘a.
We assume g(x) ̸= 0 and g′(x) ̸= 0 for x ∈]a,b[. L could be a real number or one of
±∞.
Proof. Since f(x) →0 and g(x) →0 as x ↘a we know that f and g have removable
discontinuities at a. Removing the discontinuities f and g are continuous on [a,b[
and f(a) = g(a) = 0.
Using the Cauchy's MVT there is a c = c(x) between a and x such that
f(x)−f(a)
g(x)−g(a) = f ′(c)
g′(c)
Since c(x) is between a and x, c(x) →a as x ↘a. Hence, f(c)/g(c) →L as x ↘a, by
the Composition Theorem for Limits. Since f(a) = g(a) = 0, the previous equation
can be rewritten as
f(x)
g(x) = f ′(c)
g′(c)
letting x ↘a yields the desired result.

If we replace the assumptions f(x) →0 and g(x) →0 as x ↘a, by f(x) →0
and g(x) →0 as x ↗b, then a very similar argument shows that f ′(x)
g′(x) →L as x ↗
b implies f(x)
g(x) →L as x ↗b.
A function f is C 1 on a set D, in symbols f ∈C 1(D), if f is differentiable on D
and f ′ is continuous on D. This notation was also used Sect. 6.6. Section 6.6 also
contains a version of l'Hôpital's Rule.
Exercise 6.7.2. If f,g ∈C 1(]a,∞[), f(x) →0 and g(x) →0 as x →∞, then
f ′(x)
g′(x) →L as x →∞implies f(x)
g(x) →L as x →∞.
We assume g(x) ̸= 0 and g′(x) ̸= 0 for x ∈]a,∞[.
6.8 Convexity⋆
Many important inequalities in analysis can be proved using convexity. These in-
equalities are often consequences of Jensen's inequality, below we use Jensen's

inequality to establish the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean inequality. The problems
contain additional examples of inequalities that can be established using convexity.
This section has several subsections: Cords, Regularity, Calculus, and Applica-
tions. The Regularity subsection is not used in any of the other subsections.
Let I be an interval. A function f : I →R is convex if it lies below its cords. See
Fig. 6.4. That is, if for any a < b in I, the cord
Fig. 6.4 A convex curve y = f(x) and one a it's cords
L(x) = La,b(x) := f(a)+ f(b)−f(a)
b−a
(x−a),
satisﬁes
f(x) ≤L(x) for all a < x < b.
A function f is concave, if −f is convex, that is if f lies above its cords. Looking at
the graphs of f(x) := x2 and of g(x) := |x| suggests that these functions are convex
on R.
Slopes of Cords
Let sa(x) be the slope of the cord La,x connecting (a, f(a)) to (x, f(x)), i.e.,
sa(x) := f(x)−f(a)
x−a
.
The following result shows that f is convex iff x →sa(x) is an increasing function
on a < x for all a. See the left half of Fig. 6.5.
Lemma 6.8.1. f is convex on I iff
f(y)−f(x)
y−x
≤f(z)−f(x)
z−x
for any x < y < z in I.

6 Derivatives and Their Applications
Proof. By deﬁnition f is convex iff
f(y) ≤f(x)+ f(z)−f(x)
z−x
(y−x) for all x < y < z in I.
Subtracting f(x) and dividing by y−x gives the desired conclusion.

M(x) := f(b)−f(b)−f(a)
b−a
(b−x).
(ii) Prove f is convex iff
f(z)−f(x)
z−x
≤f(z)−f(y)
z−y
for all x < y < z in I.
The second part of this exercise says that f is convex iff the slope sb(x) of the cord
connecting (x, f(x)) and (b, f(b)) is an increasing function of x, x < b, for all b. See
the right half of Fig. 6.5.
Fig. 6.5 A convex curve y = f(x) and some of it's cords. a The ﬁgure on the left illustrates Lemma
6.8.1. In the notation of Lemma 6.8.1 (x, f(x)) is the point where the cords intersect. b The ﬁgure
on the right illustrates Exercise 6.8.2. In the notation of Exercise 6.8.2 (z, f(z)) is the point where
the cords intersect
Combining the two parts of Fig. 6.5 so all the cords have a point in common (see
the left half of Fig. 6.6 for a the version that has one cord to the left of the common
point and one cord to the right of the common point) leads to:
Corollary 6.8.3. If f is convex on an interval I, then the difference quotient
sy(x) := f(x)−f(y)
x−y
is increasing as a function of x on the set I \ {y}. Since sx(y) = sy(x) it is also
increasing as a function of y on the set I \{x}.
Proof. If a < b < c are in I, then

sa(b) ≤sa(c)
(6.14)
sc(a) ≤sc(b)
(6.15)
by Lemma 6.8.1 and Exercise 6.8.2. Fix y in I. For x < z with x ̸= y and z ̸= y we
must show sy(x) ≤sy(z). If y < x < z this is (6.14) with a = y, b = x, and c = z. If
y < x < z it is (6.15) with a = x, b = z, and c = y. Finally, if x < y < z, then
sy(x) = sx(y) ≤sx(z) = sz(x) ≤sz(y) = sy(z),
by (6.14) and (6.15).

If f is convex on an interval I, then sy(x) ≤sy(z), for all x < y < z in I by Corol-
lary 6.8.3. Hence,
f(y)−f(x)
y−x
≤f(z)−f(y)
z−y
for all x < y < z in I.

Exercise 6.8.4. Conversely, show that Eq. (6.16) implies f(x) ≤La,b(x) for all a <
x < b in I.
We have proven:
Theorem 6.8.5. f is convex on an interval I iff (6.16) holds for all a < x < b in I.
Fig. 6.6 A convex curve y = f(x) and some of it's cords. The ﬁgure on the left illustrates (6.16).
The ﬁgure on the right illustrates adding a third cord
Adding a third cord gives an inequality we can use to compare the slopes of
cords that do not share an endpoint. See the right half of Fig. 6.6. Of course, this is
corresponds to two applications of Corollary 6.8.3.
Regularity
In this subsection we show that geometric information: f lies below its cords, im-
plies smoothness of f: f has one-sided derivatives.

6 Derivatives and Their Applications
A Hölder condition of order one, is also called a Lipschitz condition. Hence, f
satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition on I, if there is a constant M, such that
|f(x)−f(y)| ≤M |x−y|
for all x and y in I. Clearly, any function satisfying a Lipschitz condition on an
interval must he continuous on that interval. The Lipschitz condition is named after
Rudolf Otto Sigismund Lipschitz (14 May 1832, Königsberg to 7 October 1903,
Bonn), it is a strong form of uniform continuity.
Theorem 6.8.6. Suppose I is an open interval and f is convex on I, then f is con-
tinuous on I. In fact, f satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition on any compact subinterval of
I.
Proof. Let a < b be in I. Since I is open there is a δ > 0 such that a−δ and b+δ
are in I. Fix x < y in [a,b]. Applying Corollary 6.8.3 to
a−δ < a ≤x < y ≤b < b+δ
gives
sa (a−δ) ≤sa(x) ≤sy(x) ≤sb(x) ≤sb (b+δ).
Taking the ﬁrst, middle and last terms gives
sa (a−δ) ≤f(y)−f(x)
y−x
≤sb (b+δ).
Consequently, f satisﬁes the Lipschitz condition
|f(x)−f(y)| ≤max{|sa (a−δ)|,|sb (b+δ)|}|x−y|
for all x,y ∈[a,b]. In particular, f is continuous on [a,b]. Since [a,b] = I, where
the union is over all a < b in I, f is continuous on I.

Example 6.8.7. A convex function need not be continuous at an endpoint, for exam-
ple, f : [0,1] →R determined by f(x) :=

0
when x < 1
2
when x = 1 is convex on [0,1] and
not continuous at 1.
Example 6.8.8. The function f(x) := −
√
1−x2 is convex and continuous on the
closed interval [−1,1]. However, it does not satisfy a Lipschitz condition on any
subinterval containing at least one of the endpoints −1 or 1 of the interval [−1,1].
We show that a convex function on an open interval has one-sided derivatives at
every point in the interval and has a derivative at almost all points in the interval.
Theorem 6.8.9. Let I be an open interval and f a convex function on I. The one
sided derivatives f ′+ and f ′−exist at every point in I. Furthermore, if y < x are in
I, then

6.8 Convexity⋆
115
f ′−(y) ≤f ′+(y) ≤f ′−(x) ≤f ′+(x).
(6.17)
In particular f ′−and f ′+ are increasing functions on I.
Proof. Let I be an open interval and ﬁx x ∈I. By Corollary 6.8.3 sx(y) is an increas-
ing function of y. Hence, sx(y) decreases as y decreases. Since I is open, there are
a,b in I such that a < x < b. For x < y < b we have sx(a) ≤sx(y). It follows from
Exercise 5.1.2 that
lim
y↘xsx(y) = inf{sx(y) | x < y} ≥sx(a).
Since f ′+(x) = limy↘x sx(y), we have established the existence of the right hand
derivative. Similarly, f ′−(x) = limy↗x sx(y) is a real number ≤sx(b).
Fix y < x in I. For u,v,w,z in I satisfying
u < y < z < w < x < v
Corollary 6.8.3 implies
sy(u) ≤sy(z) ≤sx(w) ≤sx(v).
Letting u ↗y, we get
f ′−(y) ≤sy(z) ≤sx(w) ≤sx(v).
Letting z ↘y, then w ↗x, and ﬁnally v ↘x we arrive at (6.17).

Remark 6.8.10. Since f ′+ exists at every point in the open interval, it follows that f
is continuous on I. Hence, we have a second proof that a convex function deﬁned
on an open interval is continuous on that interval.
Corollary 6.8.11. Let f be a convex function deﬁned on an open interval I. There is
a countable subset A of I, such that f is differentiable on I \A.
Proof. Since f ′+ is increasing, it follows from Corollary 5.1.4 that there is a count-
able set A such that f ′+ is continuous on I \A. Fix x ∈I \A. For y < x we have
f ′+(y) ≤f ′−(x) ≤f ′+(x).
Using f ′+ is continuous at x, it follows that

y↗x f ′+(y) ≤f ′−(x) ≤f ′+(x).

In this subsection we characterize convexity of differentiable functions in terms of
properties of the ﬁrst and second derivatives.
Theorem 6.8.12. Let I be an open interval and let f : I →R be differentiable. Then
f ′ is increasing iff f is convex.
Proof. Suppose f ′ is increasing. Let x < y < z in I. By the MVT there are c ∈]x,y[
and d ∈]y,z[ such that
f ′(c) = f(y)−f(x)
y−x
and f ′(d) = f(z)−f(y)
z−y
.
Since c < y < d and f ′ is increasing we have f ′(c) ≤f ′(d), thus (6.16) holds, so f
is convex.
Conversely, suppose f is convex. Let x0 < y0 in I. For any a,b in I with a < x0 <
b < y0 we have
f(x0)−f(a)
x0 −a
≤f(y0)−f(b)
y0 −b
,
by Corollary 6.8.3. Letting a ↗x0 shows
f ′(x0) ≤f(y0)−f(b)
y0 −b
for any x0 < b < y0 in I.
Letting b ↗y0, then yields f ′(x0) ≤f ′(y0).

The following is a simple criterion for convexity.
Corollary 6.8.13. Let I be an open interval and let f : I →R. Suppose f ′′ exists on
I. Then f is convex on I iff f ′′(x) ≥0 for all x ∈I.
Proof. Let g := f ′. Using g is increasing iff g′ ≥0, completes the proof

The following exercise provides another geometrical interpretation of convexity.
Exercise 6.8.14. Let I be an open interval and f : I →R be differentiable on I. Prove
f is convex iff
f(x) ≥f(a)+ f ′(a)(x−a) for all a,x in I.
(6.18)
Thus, f is convex iff f lies above its tangents.
Suppose f has two derivatives. Recall, f is convex iff f ′′(c) ≥0 for all c in I. The
Taylor expansion
f(x) = f(x0)+ f ′(x0)(x−x0)+R1 f(x)
suggests this result, since R1 f(x) = f ′′(c)
2 (x−x0)2 and we need R1 f(x) ≥0 for f lie
above its tangent at x0.

We establish the sum version of Jensen's Inequality. This inequality is due to Jo-
han Ludwig William Valdemar Jensen (May 8, 1859, Nakskov to March 5, 1925,
Copenhagen). Jensen worked for a telephone company as an engineer.

Problems for Sect. 6.1
1. Let f(x) = x2 and let a be any real number. Show f ′(a) = 2a.
2. Let f(x) := |x|. Show f is not differentiable at 0 and f is differentiable at any

3. Suppose f : R →R is even, i.e., f(−x) = f(x) for all x. Assuming f is differ-
entiable at 0, ﬁnd f ′(0).
4. Show that the pseudo-sine function σ is differentiable at 1.
The next two problems are concerned with the linearization of f near a. Sup-
pose f is deﬁned on some open interval containing a. If f is differentiable at a,
then the line
L(x) := f(a)+ f ′(a)(x−a)
is called the tangent to f at a, and also the linearization of f at a.
5. Suppose f ′(a) exists. Let L(x) := f(a)+ f ′(a)(x−a) and E(x) := f(x)−L(x).
Then
f(x) = L(x)+E(x).
Prove
E(x)
x−a →0 as x →a.
This if often written as E(x) = o(x −a) as x →a. Where g(x) = o(φ(x)) as
x →a, means that g(x)/φ(x) →0 as x →a. This is known as "little oh" notation.

4. If f ′(a) ≥0 must f be increasing at a? [This is a proposed converse of Exercise
6.2.2.]
5. If f is strictly increasing at a and f ′(a) exists must f ′(a) > 0? [This is a proposed
converse of Exercise 6.2.3.]
6. If f ′(a) = 0 must f(a) be local extremum? [This is a proposed converse of Ex-

2. The First Derivative Test. Let f be continuous near c. Suppose f is differen-

f ′(x) < 0 on ]c,c+γ[, prove f(c) is a local maximum. [Hint: Let c−γ < x < c.
Applying the MVT to f on the interval [x,c], yields f(x)−f(c) < 0.]
3. The Second Derivative Test. Suppose f is differentiable on ]c −γ,c + γ[ for
some γ > 0, f ′(c) = 0, that f ′ is differentiable at c, and f ′′(c) > 0. ( f ′′ denotes
the derivative of f ′.) Show that f(c) is a local minimum, by completing the
following steps:
(i) Since, f ′(x)−f ′(c)

The Riemann Integral
The Riemann integral is deﬁned in terms of lower and upper step functions. The ma-
jor theorems are concerned with characterizations of integrability, the integrability
of monotone and continuous functions, the algebra of integrable functions, and the
two versions of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
We will mostly be concerned with integrals of functions f : [a,b] →R. However,
the reader can without difﬁculty extend the integral to functions f : [a,b]×[c,d] →
R, and is asked to do so in some of the exercises. It is essential that we have an
order on the values of f - not that we have an order on the domain of f. While most
of the discussing is for integrals of real valued functions, the last section considers
integrals of complex valued functions. Arc length is discussed in Sect. 11.3 it could
be covered at any time after Sect. 7.3.
7.1 Deﬁnition of the Integral
The idea of our approach to the integral of a function f : [a,b] →R is to approximate
the graph from below by the areas of a ﬁnite number of rectangles (see Fig. 7.1), then
take the best such approximation, that is the supremum of the lower approximations.
We also approximate from above by a ﬁnite number of rectangles (see Fig. 7.2), then
take the best such approximation, the inﬁmum of the upper approximations. When
the two best approximations agree we say f is integrable. To have rectangles of
ﬁnite height we need f to be bounded. To have a ﬁnite number of rectangles of ﬁnite
width we need the interval [a,b] to be bounded.
Step Functions
A ﬁnite collection of points a = x0 < x1 < ··· < xn = b is called a partition of the
closed and bounded interval [a,b]. Given a partition a = x0 < x1 < ··· < xn = b

7 The Riemann Integral
a function s : [a,b] →R that is constant on the open intervals ]xk−1,xk[ is a step
function. So, a step function is determined by a partition and real numbers Ak by
setting
s(x) :=
n
∑
k=1
Ak1]xk−1,xk[(x)
for x in [a,b]. Recall,
1U(x) =

1
if x ∈U
0
if x /∈U.
The values of a step function at the partition points x0,x1,...,xn are not important
in what follows. For a step function s := ∑n
k=1 Ak1]xk−1,xk[ we write
∑s = ∑
P
s =
n
∑
i=1
Ai(xi −xi−1),
where P = {x0,x1,...,xn} is the set of partition points.
If f : [a,b] →R be a bounded function, then m = m( f) is some lower bound for
f and M = M( f) is some upper bound for f. That is m ≤f(x) ≤M for all x.
If s : [a,b] →R is a step function such that s(x) ≤f(x) for all x ∈[a,b], except
possibly at the partition points, then s is a lower step function for
f and ∑s is a
lower sum for f. The shaded areas in Fig. 7.1 illustrates lower sums.
Fig. 7.1 Lower step functions—in one case the function is positive. The two parts of this ﬁgure
are essentially identical except for a vertical shift
Lemma 7.1.1. Let f : [a,b] →R be a bounded function. The set of lower sums for f
is nonempty and bounded above.
Proof. The set of lower sums is nonempty, because any bounded function has at
least one lower step function. For example, s(x) = m for x ∈[a,b] is a lower step
function for f. If s = ∑n
k=1 ak1]xk−1,xk[ is any lower step function for f, then ai ≤
f(x) ≤M for any xi−1 < x < xi, so
∑s =
n
∑
i=1
ai(xi −xi−1) ≤
n
∑
i=1
M(xi −xi−1) = M(b−a).

7.1 Deﬁnition of the Integral

Hence, M(b−a) is an upper bound for the set of lower sums.

Similarly, if S : [a,b] →R is a step function such that f(x) ≤S(x) for all x ∈[a,b],
except possibly for the partition points, then S is an upper step function for f and
∑S is an upper sum for f. The shaded areas in Fig. 7.2 illustrates upper sums.

Deﬁnition 7.1.4. A bounded function f : [a,b] →R is (Riemann) integrable
if
´ b
a f =
´ b
a f. We write
´ b
a f for this common value and call this number the inte-
gral of f.
Remark 7.1.5. Consider a positive function f(x) ≥0 for x ∈[a,b]. Consider the re-
gion R below the graph of f and above the x-axis. A lower sum for f is a lower
bound for the area of R, see Fig. 7.1. Similarly, an upper sum for f gives an upper
bound for the area of R, see Fig. 7.2. Hence, it is natural to say that R has an area
when f is integrable and that this area equals
´ b
a f. Calculating areas by approxi-
mating both from the outside and from the inside was also done by Archimedes (c.
287 BC Syracuse-c. 212 BC Syracuse).
In the next section, we will obtain a useful characterization of (Riemann) integra-
bility. In particular, we will show that a step function s is integrable and
´ b
a s = ∑s.

7 The Riemann Integral
Example 7.1.6. The function f : [0,1] →R, determined by f(x) = 1 if x ∈Q and
f(x) = 0 otherwise is not integrable.
Proof. By density of the rationals any upper sum is ≥1. Similarly, it follows from
density of the irrationals that any lower sum is ≤0. Consequently,
´ 1
0 f ≤0 < 1 ≤
´ 1
0 f.

The integral is monotone in the sense:
Exercise 7.1.7. If f,g : [a,b] →R are integrable and f ≤g, then

More on Step Functions
We establish some technical results related to step functions. The main result shows
that if we have a step function s and construct a new step function s′ by inserting
additional partition points, then the two step functions s and s′ have the same sum.
Hence, when considering two step function s and S we can assume they have the
same partition points.
Fig. 7.3 Inserting one additional partition point. The ﬁgure on the right has one additional partition
point. Clearly, the two step functions have the same sum
Let P : a = x0 < x1 < ··· < xm = b and Q : a = y0 < y1 < ··· < yn = b be partitions
of [a,b]. If

x j | j = 1,2,...,m

is a subset of {yk | k = 0,1,...,n}, then Q is a
reﬁnement of P. If g is a step function with respect to some partition P and that Q is
a reﬁnement of P, then we can also view g as a step function with respect to Q, the
next lemma shows that ∑p g = ∑Q g. See Fig. 7.3.
Lemma 7.1.8. Let g be a step function. If g′ is obtained from g by inserting a ﬁnite
number of additional partition points, then ∑g′ = ∑g.
Proof. Consider a step function g = ∑n
k=1 Ak1]xk−1xk[. Let t a point in [a,b] which
is not one of the xi's. Suppose xj−1 < t < xj. Let yk := xk and Bk := Ak, when
k < j; yj := t, Bj := Aj; and yk := xk−1 and Bk := Ak−1, when k > j. Let g1 :=
∑n+1
k=1 Bk1]yk−1,yk[. Then g1(x) = Ai if xi−1 < x < xi and i ̸= j, and g(x) = Aj if xj−1 <

7.1 Deﬁnition of the Integral
131
x < t and if t < x < x j. So g1 has the same values as g, but there is one more division
point. Hence,
∑

g1 = ∑
i̸= j
Ai(xi −xi−1)+A j(t −xj−1)+A j(x j −t)
=
n
∑
i=1
Ai(xi −xi−1) = ∑
P
g,
because (t −x j−1)+(xj −t) = x j −x j−1. Suppose g2 is similarly obtained from g1
by inserting an additional division point, then we get ∑g2 = ∑g1. But g2 is obtained
from g by inserting two additional division points and ∑g2 = ∑g. By induction we
can insert any ﬁnite number of additional partition points.

The following consequence of this lemma is very useful.
Corollary 7.1.9. If s,t are step functions with respect to the partitions P,Q of [a,b],
then we can view s,t as step functions with respect to the common partition R =
P∪Q and ∑R s = ∑P s and ∑Rt = ∑Qt.
If s = ∑n
k=1 Ak1]xk−1xk[, then as = ∑n
k=1 aAk1]xk−1xk[, hence a multiple of a step func-
tion is a step function.
Exercise 7.1.10. The sum of two step functions is a step function.
If s is a lower step function for f and S is an upper step function for f then s ≤S.
But, since s and S may correspond to different subdivisions of [a,b] it is not easy to
compare their sums ∑s and ∑S. The next lemma shows that, in fact, the upper sum
is larger than the lower sum.
Lemma 7.1.11. Let f be a bounded function. If s is a lower step function for f and
S is an upper step function for f, then ∑s ≤∑S.
Proof. Suppose s corresponds to the partition P : y0 < ··· < yl and S corresponds
to the partition Q : z0 < ··· < zm. Let {x0,...,xn} be the union of {y0,...,yl} and
{z0,...,zm}. So R : x0 < ··· < xn is a reﬁnement of P and of Q. By Lemma 7.1.8
∑P s = ∑R s. Similarly, for ∑Q S = ∑R S. With respect to the partition x0 < ··· < xn
we have s(x) = ai and S(x) = Ai for xi−1 < x < xi. Also, ai = s(x) ≤f(x) ≤S(x) = Ai,
when xi−1 < x < xi, hence ai ≤Ai. It follows that

ai(xi −xi−1) ≤

Ai(xi −xi−1) = ∑

as we needed to establish.

This result seems obvious, if we think of the upper and lower sums in terms of
areas. See Figs. 7.1 and 7.2.

7 The Riemann Integral
7.2 Characterizations of Riemann Integrability
In this section, we establish techniques that simplify verifying that a given function
is integrable and in the afﬁrmative case simpliﬁes calculating its integral.
Preliminary Versions
We begin by observing that Lemma 7.1.11 implies that the lower integral is always
smaller than the upper integral.
Lemma 7.2.1. If f : [a,b] →R is a bounded function, then
´ b
a f ≤
´ b
a f.
Proof. If s is any lower step function and S is any upper step function, then ∑s ≤∑S
by Lemma 7.1.11. Thinking of S as ﬁxed, we see that ∑S is an upper bound for the
set of all lower sums, and therefore
ˆ b
a
f = sup
∑s | s

≤∑S.
(7.1)
But, since S is an arbitrary upper step function, then
´ b
a f is a lower bound for the
set of upper sums. So we get
ˆ b
a
f ≤inf
∑S | S

=
ˆ b
a
f.
(7.2)
As we needed to show.

We could have referred to Proposition 3.3.1, instead we repeated the proof.
For any bounded function f any lower step function s and any upper step function
S we have
∑s ≤
ˆ b
a
f ≤
ˆ b
a
f ≤∑S
(7.3)
by Lemma 7.2.1. In particular, we have an analogue of the Nested Interval Theorem.
Corollary 7.2.2. Suppose f is integrable. If I is a real number such that
∑s ≤I ≤∑S
for all lower step functions s for f and all upper step functions S for f, then
´ b
a f = I.
Our next aim it to make these observations easier to use by showing it is not neces-
sary to consider all step functions.

7.2 Characterizations of Riemann Integrability
133
Improved Versions
The results in the previous subsection require us to consider all lower sums and all
upper sums. The results in this subsection allow us to use conveniently chosen lower
and upper sums (Fig. 7.4).
Fig. 7.4 The shaded area illustrates ∑S−∑s. Compare to Figs. 7.1 and 7.2
Theorem 7.2.3 (Existence Theorem for Integrals). Let f : [a,b] →R be a bounded
function. Then f is integrable if and only if given any ε > 0 there exists a lower step
function sε for f and an upper step function Sε for f such that ∑Sε −∑sε < ε.
Proof. Suppose f is integrable. Let ε > 0 be given. Let s be a lower step function
such that
´ b
a f < ∑s+ ε
2 and let S be an upper step function such that ∑S−ε
2 <
´ b
a f.
Since
´ b
a f =
´ b
a f we get ∑S−ε
2 < ∑s+ ε
2. Rearranging, leads to ∑S−∑s < ε.
Conversely, suppose f is not integrable. Let ε :=
´ b
a f −
´ b
a f, then ε > 0. If s is
any lower step function and S is any upper step function, then
∑s ≤
ˆ b
a
f =
ˆ b
a
f −ε ≤∑S−ε.
Hence, ∑S−∑s ≥ε as we needed to show.

The condition that given any ε > 0 we can ﬁnd a lower step function s for f and
an upper step function S for f such that ∑S −∑s < ε, is satisﬁed if we can ﬁnd a
sequence (sn) of lower step functions for f and a sequence (Sn) upper step functions
for f such that the sequence (∑Sn −∑sn) is null, hence:
Corollary 7.2.4. Let f : [a,b] →R be bounded. If there are lower step functions sn
and upper step functions Sn for f, such that the sequence (∑Sn −∑sn) is null, then
f is integrable.
The next result allows us to evaluate
´ b
a f at the same time as we show that f is
integrable.

134
7 The Riemann Integral
Theorem 7.2.5 (Evaluation Theorem for Integrals).
Let f : [a,b] →R be a
bounded function and let I be a real number. Suppose for any ε > 0 we can ﬁnd
a lower step function sε for f and an upper step function Sε for f, such that
∑Sε −∑sε < ε and ∑sε ≤I ≤∑Sε, then f is integrable and
´ b
a f = I.
Proof. It follows from the Existence Theorem (Theorem 7.2.3) that f is integrable.
Suppose
´ b
a f ̸= I. Let ε :=
I −
´ b
a f
/2. Then I and

As above, we can formulate this in terms of sequences:
Corollary 7.2.6. Let f : [a,b] →R be bounded. If there are lower step functions sn
and upper step functions Sn for f, such that the sequence (∑Sn −∑sn) is null and I
is a real number such that sn ≤I ≤Sn for all n, then f is integrable and
´ b
a f = I.
Example 7.2.7. Let f(x) = 2x. Then f is integrable on [0,3] and

Proof. Consider the partition xk := 3k

7.3 Examples of Integrable Functions
In this section, we show that step functions, monotone functions, and continuous
functions deﬁned on compact intervals are integrable.
Proposition 7.3.1. If f : [a,b] →R is a step function, then f is integrable and
´ b
a f =
∑f.
Proof. Let s = f and S = f then s is a lower step function for f and S is an upper
step function for f. Clearly, ∑S −∑s = 0 and ∑s ≤∑f ≤∑S. Hence, the result
follows from Theorem 7.2.5.

in the proof of Theorem 7.3.2. The rectangle
on the left has height f(b)−f(a) and width b−a
n
Theorem 7.3.2. Monotone functions are integrable.
Proof. Let f : [a,b] →R be increasing. f is bounded since f(a) ≤f(x) ≤f(b). Let
ε > 0 be given. Let n be an integer such that
(f(b)−f(a))b−a
n
< ε.
Let xi = a+ b−a
n i for i = 0,...,n; and let s(x) = f(xi−1) for xi−1 < x < xi. Since f is
increasing s is a lower step function for f. Similarly, S(x) = f(xi) for xi−1 < x < xi
determines an upper step function for f.
∑S−∑s = ∑f(xi)(xi −xi−1)−∑f(xi−1)(xi −xi−1)
since xi −xi−1 = b−a
n
we get
∑S−∑s = ∑(f(xi)−f(xi−1))b−a
n
= ( f(b)−f(a))b−a
n
< ε.
See Fig. 7.5. So f is integrable by Theorem 7.2.3.

7 The Riemann Integral
Recall, a monotone function can be discontinuous at an inﬁnite number of points,
in fact, it can be discontinuous at a dense set of points, see Example 5.1.5.
Fig. 7.6 Illustrating ∑S−∑s < ε in the proof of Theorem 7.3.3. Since Mi−mi <
ε
b−a, the rectangle
at the bottom has height <
ε
b−a. Clearly, it has width b−a
Theorem 7.3.3. Continuous functions are integrable.
Proof. Let f : [a,b] →R be continuous. Then f is bounded, since a continuous
function on a compact intervals has a largest and a smallest value. Let ε > 0 be
given. Since f is deﬁned on a compact interval f is uniformly continuous. Hence,
there exists a δ > 0, such that |x−y| < δ implies |f(x)−f(y)| <
ε
b−a. Let n be an
integer such that b−a
n
< δ. Let xi = a+ b−a
n i for i = 0,...,n. Let mi = f(x∗
i ) be the
smallest value of f on the interval [xi−1,xi]. Let Mi = f(y∗
i ) be the largest value of
f on the interval [xi−1,xi]. Since x∗
i and y∗
i are in [xi−1,xi] we have
|x∗
i −y∗
i | ≤|xi −xi−1| = b−a
n
< δ,
hence Mi −mi = f(y∗
i ) −f(x∗
i ) <
ε
b−a. Let s(x) = mi on xi−1 < x < xi. Then s is a
lower step function for f by the construction of mi. Similarly, S(x) = Mi on xi−1 <
x < xi is an upper step function for f. By construction of s and S we have (Fig. 7.6)
∑S−∑s = ∑(Mi −mi)(xi −xi−1)
<
ε
b−a ∑(xi −xi−1)
= ε.
Hence, f is integrable by Theorem 7.2.3.

Below is an outline that shows how the preceding two proofs are similar.
Proof. [Uniﬁed proof of the two previous theorems] Let f : [a,b] →R be a bounded
function. Let ε > 0 be given. Let s and S be a lower and an upper step function for
f. By Corollary 7.1.9 we may assume that s and S corresponds to the same partition.
If

7.4 Algebra of Integrable Functions
137
∑s = ∑mi(xi −xi−1)
∑S = ∑Mi(xi −xi−1)
then
∑S−∑s = ∑(Mi −mi)(xi −xi−1).
If f is continuous, then f is uniformly continuously, hence we can choose the parti-
tion such that
Mi −mi < !ε :=
ε
b−a.
Consequently,
∑S−∑s ≤!ε∑(xi −xi−1) = !ε(b−a) = ε.
If f is increasing, then Mi = f(xi) and mi = f(xi−1). So, we choose the partition
such that
xi −xi−1 ≤δ :=
ε
f(b)−f(a).
Consequently,
∑S−∑s ≤∑(f(xi)−f(xi−1))δ = ( f(b)−f(a))δ = ε.
In either case, f is integrable by Theorem 7.2.3.

Exercise 7.3.4. If f : [a,b] →R is continuous, f ≥0, and
´ b
a f = 0, then f = 0.
Exercise 7.3.5. If f : [a,b] :→R is continuous, f ≥0, and f(c) > 0 for some c ∈
[a,b], then
´ b
a f > 0.
7.4 Algebra of Integrable Functions
In order not to have to refer to the lower/upper step functions every time we con-
sider an integral we need to develop some properties of the integral. Doing so is the
purpose of this section and of Sect. 7.5.
The transformation f →
´ b
a f is linear:
Proposition 7.4.1. Let f and g be integrable functions on [a,b] and let c and d be
constants, then cf +dg is integrable and
´ b
a (cf +dg) = c
´ b
a f +d
´ b
a g.
Proof. Suppose k > 0. Let ε > 0 be given. Suppose s (resp. S) is a lower (resp.
upper) step function for f such that ∑S −∑s < ε
k . Since k > 0, ks (resp. kS) is a
lower (resp. upper) step function for k f such that ∑kS −∑ks = k(∑S−∑s) < ε.
Furthermore,
∑ks = k∑s ≤k
ˆ b
a
f ≤k∑S = ∑kS.
Hence, it follows from Theorem 7.2.5 that k f is integrable and
´ b
a k f = k
´ b
a f.

7 The Riemann Integral
It remains to show that f +g is integrable and that
´ b
a (f +g) =
´ b
a f +
´ b
a g. Let
ε > 0 be given. Let s f ,sg,Sf ,Sg be step functions such that s f (x) ≤f(x) ≤Sf (x),
sg(x) ≤g(x) ≤Sg(x) for all x in [a,b], (except possibly at partition points, as usual,)
and such that ∑S f −∑s f < ε
2 and ∑Sg −∑sg < ε
2. Then
sf (x)+sg(x) ≤(f +g)(x) ≤Sf (x)+Sg(x),
so sf +sg is a lower step function for f +g and S f +Sg is an upper step function for
f +g. Clearly,
∑(S f +Sg)−∑(s f +sg) = ∑Sf −∑s f +∑Sg −∑sg
< ε
2 + ε
2 = ε
and
∑(s f +sg) = ∑s f +∑sg ≤
ˆ b
a

ˆ b

g
≤∑Sf +∑Sg = ∑(S f +Sg).
So f +g is integrable and
´ b
a (f +g) =
´ b
a f +
´ b
a g.

Exercise 7.4.2. Complete the proof when k ≤0.
Remark 7.4.3. Many proof using step functions follow the pattern used in the proof
of linearity: Assume f and g are integrable and you want to show that some "trans-
form" of f and/or g is integrable. Pick lower/upper step functions s f /Sf and sg/Sg
for f and g, such that ∑Sf −∑s f and ∑Sg −∑sg are "small." Apply the transform
to the step functions. Check that the transformed step functions give lower/upper
step functions for the transformed functions and that the difference of the sums of
the transformed step functions is small.
Given a function f the function f +(x) := max{f(x),0} is the positive part of f and
f −(x) := max{−f(x),0} is the negative part of f. Note f = f +−f −and f + f −= 0.

Before dismissing the following theorem as trivial the reader may want to re-
call that, if σ is the pseudosine function, then xσ(1/x) is continuous on [0,1] and
changes sign inﬁnitely many times on the interval [0,1].
Proposition 7.4.4. If f is integrable, then so are the positive and negative parts f ±
of f.

7 The Riemann Integral
The next result shows that the restriction of an integrable function on [a,b] to some
subinterval [c,d] ⊂[a,b] is integrable on [c,d]. The result will be useful when we
discuss the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Theorem 7.4.8. If f in integrable on [a,b] and [c,d] ⊆[a,b], then f is integrable on
[c,d].
Proof. Let g be the restriction of f to [c,d]. We must show that g is integrable on
[c,d].
Let ε > 0 be given. Let s,S be upper and lower step functions for f, such that
∑S −∑s < ε. We may assume that s and S have the same partition points x0 <
x1 < ··· < xn, and that c,d are among these partition points. Suppose c = xm and
d = xm+k. If t is the restriction of s to [c,d] and T is the restriction of S to [c,d], then

The next two related results (Exercises 7.4.9 and 7.4.10) can be established using
similar arguments.

The previous two results involved splitting up the interval, the next exercise puts
two intervals together.

Exercise 7.4.10. Suppose a < b < c. Let g : [a,b] →R and h : [b,c] →R be inte-

Clearly, this can be extended to a ﬁnite number of terms by induction. Our next goal
is to show that the product of two integrable functions is an integrable function.
Exercise 7.4.11. If f is integrable on [a,b] and f ≥0, then f 2 is integrable on [a,b].
Exercise 7.4.12. If f is integrable on [a,b], then f 2 is integrable on [a,b].
Theorem 7.4.13. If f and g are integrable on [a,b], then the product fg is integrable
on [a,b].
Proof. f + g and f −g are integrable, since sums and constant multiples of in-
tegrable functions are integrable. So (f + g)2 and (f −g)2 are integrable by the
previous exercise. Since
fg = 1

(f +g)2 −(f −g)2
we conclude fg is integrable.

The composition of two integrable functions need not be integrable, see the prob-
lems for an example illustrating this.
7.5 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
In this section, we relate the integral to the derivative, that is, we prove the two
versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Isaac Newton (4 January 1643
Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth to 31 March 1727 Kensington) established the Fun-
damental Theorem as we know it. We also derive some consequences of the Funda-
mental Theorem.
Theorem 7.5.1. [The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part I, FTC-Derivative]
Suppose f : [a,b] →R is integrable on [a,b] and continuous at x0. Let g(x) :=
´ x
a f.
Then g is differentiable at x0 and g′ (x0) = f (x0).
Proof. Fix x0 ∈[a,b]. Let ε > 0 be given. Since f is continuous at x0 there is a δ > 0
such that |t −x0| < δ implies |f(t)−f(x0)| < ε. Clearly,

Thus, g′ (x0) exists and g′ (x0) = f (x0).

Exercise 7.5.2. Complete the proof by considering x0 −δ < x < x0.
Theorem 7.5.3. [The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II, FTC-Evaluation]
If f : [a,b] →R is integrable and F : [a,b] →R is continuous on [a,b], differentiable
on ]a,b[, and F′ = f on ]a,b[, then
ˆ b
a
f = F(b)−F(a).
Proof. Let S = ∑Ai1]xi−1,xi[ be an upper step function for f. By the Mean Value
Theorem there are xi−1 < ci < xi such that
F(b)−F(a) =

The inequality used that f(x) ≤Ai for all xi−1 < ci < xi. Similarly, ∑s ≤F(b)−F(a)
for any lower step function for f. An application of the Evaluation Theorem for
Integrals completes the proof.

Exercise 7.5.4. Verify, the claim, that ∑s ≤F(b)−F(a) for any lower step function
for f.
Example 7.5.5. If F is not differentiable at all points in the interval, then the con-
clusion of part II of the fundamental theorem may fail. To see this let F(x) :=

0
when −1 ≤x < 0

when 0 < x ≤1
, then f(x) := F′(x) = 0, x ̸= 0, determines an integrable

function, but
´ 1
−1 f = 0 ̸= 1 = F(1)−F(−1). Hence, F must be differentiable at all
points in the interval.
The reader might have noticed that the F is the previous problem is not even con-
tinuous, much less differentiable.
Remark 7.5.6. (For those familiar with the Devil's Staircase.) Let F be the Devil's
Staircase. Then F′ = 0 on the complement [0,1] \C of the Cantor set C. Hence,
´ 1
0 f = 0 ̸= 1 = F(1)−F(0), where f is any bounded function that equals F′ on the
complement of the Cantor set.
Remark 7.5.7. A weaker version of the second part of the fundamental theorem can
be derived from the ﬁrst part. To apply the ﬁrst part of the fundamental theorem we
must assume f is continuous not just integrable. This proof of the weaker version of
part II of the fundamental theorem is outlined below.
Proof. Suppose f is continuous. Let G(x) =
´ x
a f. By part I of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, G′ = f = F′. So (F −G)′ = 0 and therefore F −G is constant.
In particular,
F(b)−G(b) = F(a)−G(a).
Consequently,
F(b)−F(a) = G(b) =
ˆ b
a
f
since G(a) = 0.

The basic computational rules: Integration by Parts and the Change of Variables
Formula are consequences of FTC-Evaluation.
Theorem 7.5.8 (Integration by Parts). Suppose f and g are differentiable and that
the derivatives f ′ and g′ are integrable on [a,b], then
ˆ b
a
f g′ = f(b)g(b)−f(a)g(a)−
ˆ b
a
f ′g.
Proof. It follows from the product rule that
(fg)′ = f ′g+ f g′ hence fg′ = (fg)′ −f ′g.
All the terms in the last equality are integrable. For example, f is differentiable,
hence continuous and therefore integrable and g′ is integrable by assumption. Since
the product of two integrable functions is an integrable function we conclude the
product f g′ is integrable. Similarly f ′g is integrable. Finally, ( fg)′ is integrable,
since it equals the sum of the integrable functions f ′g and f g′. So by linearity of
the integral
ˆ b
a
f g′ =
ˆ b

(fg)′ −

Since ( fg)′ is integrable we can apply FTC-Evaluation to conclude

(fg)(b)−( fg)(a).

7 The Riemann Integral
Example 7.5.9. If f has a continuous second derivative f ′′, that is f ∈C 2, then
f(b) = f(a)+(b−a) f ′(a)+
ˆ b
a
(b−x) f ′′(x)dx.
Proof. Using integration by parts and FTC-Evaluation we get
ˆ b
a
(b−x) f ′′(x)dx = (b−b) f ′(b)−(b−a) f ′(a)−
ˆ b
a
(0−1) f ′(x)dx
= −(b−a) f ′(a)+ f(b)−f(a).
Rearranging leads to the desired formula.

By induction this argument leads to Taylor's Formula, with the remainder in
integral form. See the problems.
The following is sometimes called Integration by Substitution.
Theorem 7.5.10 (Change of Variables). Suppose F and g are differentiable. As-
sume f := F′ is integrable on the closed interval with endpoints g(a) and g(b) and
that f ◦g and g′ are integrable on [a,b], then
ˆ b
a
(f ◦g)g′ =
ˆ g(b)
g(a)
f.
(7.4)
Proof. The functions f,F satisﬁes the assumptions of FTC-Evaluation on the inter-
val with endpoints g(a) and g(b), hence
´ g(b)
g(a) f = F(g(b))−F(g(a)).
The product ( f ◦g)g′ is integrable, since f ◦g and g′ are integrable and the prod-
uct of integrable functions is integrable. Using
(F(g(x)))′ = f(g(x))g′(x)
and FTC-Evaluation we conclude
´ b
a (f ◦g)g′ = F(g(b))−F(g(a)).
Since both integrals equals F(g(b))−F(g(a)), they are equal. Consequently, we
have established (7.4).

Sometimes it is convenient to write
ˆ b
a
f(x)dx :=
ˆ b

f.
With this notation (7.4) is sometimes written as
ˆ b

f(g(x))g′(x)dx =

f(u)du
where the change of variables is u = g(x).

If f(u) := √u and g(x) := 1+x2, then f ◦g(x) = f(g(x)) =

Hence,

Linear Change of Variables
In the change of variables theorem we assumed that f ◦g is integrable. The reason
for this is that there are integrable functions f and g such that f ◦g makes sense, yet
f ◦g is not integrable. In some cases f ◦g is integrable, for example, if f and g both
are continuous, then f ◦g is continuous and therefore integrable. We will have use
for the case where f is integrable and g is linear.
Theorem 7.5.12. If f : [a,b] →R is integrable, α ̸= 0 and β are real numbers, and
g(x) := αx+β, then f ◦g is integrable on the interval with endpoints g−1(a) = a−β

Proof. Suppose α > 0. Let ε > 0 be given. Pick a lower step function s = ∑mk1]xk−1,xk[
for f and an upper step function S = ∑Mk1]xk−1,xk[ for f such that ∑S −∑s <
αε. Then t := ∑mk1]g−1(xk−1),g−1(xk)[ is a lower step function for f ◦g and T :=
∑Mk1]g−1(xk−1),g−1(xk)[ is an upper step function for f ◦g. Since, g−1(x) = x−β

see that
∑t = ∑mk

g−1(xk)−g−1(xk−1)

α ∑mk (xk −xk−1) = 1
α ∑s
and similarly ∑T = 1
α ∑S. Consequently, ∑T −∑t = 1
α (∑S−∑s) < ε, so f ◦g is
integrable, by the Existence Theorem for Integrals. Also,
∑s = α∑t ≤α

f ◦g ≤α∑T = ∑S
hence

The case where α < 0 is similar.

We deﬁned the integral on closed and bounded intervals. We extend this to un-
bounded intervals in the following way.

limit

if f is integrable on [c,b] for all c ∈]a,b[ and the limit exists. This sometimes allows
us to consider the integral in cases, where f may not be bounded on the interval of
interest.

´ 1
0 f exists.
7.7 Complex Valued Functions
Complex values functions are integrated by integrating their real and imaginary
parts. Let f : [a,b] →C. We say f is integrable on [a,b], if the real and imagi-
nary parts, Re f and Im f, of f both are integrable on [a,b]. If f is integrable on

ˆ b

f =
ˆ b
a
(Re f +iIm f) :=
ˆ b
a
Re f +i
ˆ b
a
Im f.
Since the integral of a complex valued function is determined by its real and
imaginary parts, we get many properties of the integral of complex valued functions
by considering the real and imaginary parts of such functions. For example,
Exercise 7.7.1. If f,g : [a,b] →C are integrable, then
1. f +g is integrable and
´ b
a (f +g) =
´ b

2. fg is integrable.
The main result in this section is:
Theorem 7.7.2. If f : [a,b] →C is integrable, then |f| is integrable on [a,b].
Proof. Since products and sums of real valued integrable functions are integrable
and |f| =

(Re f)2 +(Im f)2, it is sufﬁcient to show, if f ≥0 is integrable, then
√f is integrable. This is established in Proposition 7.7.4.

Proof. Suppose f ≥0 is integrable on [a,b]. Let ε > 0 be given. Let

In particular, 0 < δ ≤ε.
Since f is integrable, f is bounded. Let M be an upper bound for f. Since f is
integrable, there is a lower step function !s = ∑n
i=1 !ai1]xi−1,xi[ for f and an upper step
function !S = ∑n

Solutions and Hints for the Exercises

Exercise 7.1.7. Any lower step function for f is a lower step function for g,
consequently
´ b

Exercise 7.1.10. If it is not clear how to proceed: examine the proof of Lemma
7.1.11.
Exercise 7.1.12. If [a,b]×[c,d] is a rectangle, a = x0 < ··· < xm = b is a partition
of [a,b], c < y0 ··· < yn = d is a partition of [c,d], and A j,k are real numbers, then
f(x,y) := ∑m
j=1 ∑n
k=1 Aj,k1]x j−1x j[×]yk−1yk[(x,y) is a step function.
Exercise 7.3.4. If f ̸= 0, then f(c) > 0 for some c. By Local Positivity for Limits
f is ≥f(c)/2 on some open interval I containing c. Let L be the length of I. Then
any upper sum for f is ≥L f(c)/2. Hence, the upper integral of f is ≥L f(c)/2.
Thus,
´ b
a f ≥L f(c)/2.
Exercise 7.3.5. Equivalent to the Exercise 7.3.4.
Exercise 7.4.2. If k = 0, k f is the zero function which has integral zero. The case
where k < 0 is similar to the 0 < k case, the only changes are kS is a lower step
function and ks is an upper step function for k f.
Exercise 7.4.5. One way is to mimic the proof that f + is integrable. Another is
to use that f −= f + −f.
Exercise 7.4.6. Prove and use |f| = f + + f −.
Exercise 7.4.7. Integrate the inequalities −| f| ≤f ≤|f|.
Exercise 7.4.9. By the theorem both
´ c
a f and
´ b
c f exists. Let ε > 0 be given.
Since f is integrable on [a,c] there is a lower step function s1 for f on [a,c] and an
upper step function S1 for f on [a,c], such that ∑S1 −∑s1 < ε/2. Similarly, there
is a lower step function s2 for f on [c,b] and an upper step function S2 for f on
[c,b], such that ∑S2 −∑s2 < ε/2. If s1 = ∑m
k=1 mk1]xk−1,xk[, S1 = ∑m
k=1 Mk1]xk−1,xk[,
s2 = ∑n
k=m+1 mk1]xk−1,xk[, and S2 = ∑n
k=m+1 Mk1]xk−1,xk[, then s := ∑n
k=1 mk1]xk−1,xk[
is a lower step function for f on [a,b] and S := ∑n
k=1 Mk1]xk−1,xk[ is an upper step
function for f on [a,b].
The rest is similar to the last part of the proof that the sum of two integrable
functions is integrable. We include some of the details. ∑S−∑s = (∑S1 +∑S2)−
(∑s1 +∑s2) = (∑S1 −∑s1) + (∑S2 −∑s2) < ε. It follows that
´ b

∑S = ∑Mi(xi −xi−1), such that ∑S−∑s <

2M. We may assume 0 ≤mi and Mi ≤M
for all i. Then s2 is a lower step function for f 2, S2 is an upper step function for f 2,
and ∑S2 −∑s2 < ε.
Exercise 7.4.12. For some K, f +K ≥0 and f 2 = ( f +K)2 −2K f −K2.
Exercise 7.5.2. Similar to the proof in the text, except we need to pay attention
to signs.
Exercise 7.5.4. Similar to the proof in the text.
Exercise 7.6.1. Use FTC-Evaluation to calculate

Exercise 7.6.2. Similar to Exercise 7.6.1.
Exercise 7.7.1. Consider the real and imaginary parts.
Exercise 7.7.3. We may assume y < x. Then squaring √x −√y ≤√x−y and
simplifying leads to √y < √x. Rewriting this as y < x implies √y < √x, etc., ending
with √x−√y ≤√x−y proves the inequality.
Exercise 7.7.6. This is a simple proof by induction. When n = 1, (7.11) is an
equality. Suppose

The Logarithm and the Exponential Function
The natural logarithmic and exponential functions are constructed in this chapter.
In addition to establishing the standard properties of these functions we show the
number e is transcendental, construct a smooth compactly supported function (a
"bump" function), and deﬁne the Euler constant γ.
8.1 Logarithms
For a real number x > 0, let
log(x) :=
ˆ x
1
1
t dt.
Note log(1) = 0, log(x) < 0 when 0 < x < 1, and log(x) > 0 when 1 < x.
The FTC-Derivative shows that log is differentiable and
log′(x) = 1
x.
Since we can differentiate 1/x as many times as we please log ∈C n(]0,∞[) for any
n. Consequently, log ∈C ∞(]0,∞[). The basic computational property of a logarithm
is:
Theorem 8.1.1. For all x,y > 0 we have
log(xy) = log+log(y).
Proof. This is a simple calculation. If x,y > 0, then
log(xy) =
ˆ xy

Exercise 8.1.2. Explain the steps in the calculation above.
Exercise 8.1.3. log(xn) = nlog(x) for n ∈N and x > 0.
Lemma 8.1.4. For all x > 0 and all n ∈Z we have log(xn) = nlog(x). Recall the
convention x0 = 1.
Proof. Using the previous exercise: log(x−n)+log(xn) = log(x−nxn) = log(1) = 0.
Hence, log(x−n) = −nlog(x).

Theorem 8.1.5. The function log :]0,∞[→R is strictly increasing and onto.
Proof. If x < y, then
´ y
x
1
t dt > 0, because t →1/t is continuous (Exercise 7.3.5).
Consequently, log(y) =

´ y

t dt > log(x). So log is strictly in-

x > 0.)

Let y be a real number, then −n < y < n for some positive integer n, hence
log

4−n
= −nlog(4) < −n < y.
Similarly, y < log(4n). Consequently, log(4−n) < y < log(4n). By the Intermediate
Value Theorem y = log(x) for some x between 4−n and 4n.

Remark 8.1.6. It follows from the proof that log(x) →∞as x →∞. For example,
x > 4n implies log(x) > n. Similarly, log(x) →−∞as x ↘0.

8.2 Exponentials

It is not known if γ is rational or irrational. Godfrey Harold Hardy (7 February 1877,
Cranleigh to 1 December 1947, Cambridge) offered to give up his Savilian Chair at
Oxford to anyone who proved γ to be irrational. Hilbert mentioned the irrationality
of gamma as an unsolved problem.
8.2 Exponentials
Since log :]0,∞[→R is strictly increasing and surjective it has a strictly increasing
inverse function exp mapping R onto the interval ]0,∞[. In symbols:
exp(x) := log−1(x).
In particular, exp(log(x)) = x for all x > 0 and log(exp(y)) = y for all y in R.
Remark 8.2.1. Using that exp is strictly increasing we see that exp(x) →∞as x →∞.
In fact, x > log(N) implies exp(x) > exp(log(N)) = N. Similarly, exp(x) →0 as
x →−∞.
Since log is differentiable, we infer from the Inverse Function Rule for Derivatives
that exp is differentiable and
exp′(x) =
1
log′(exp(x)) =
1
1/exp(x) = exp(x).
Since exp′ = exp, the right hand side is differentiable, so we can differentiate exp as
many times as we please: exp ∈C ∞(R).
The basic computational property of an exponential function is:
Exercise 8.2.2. exp(x+y) = exp(x)exp(y) for all x,y ∈R.
The exponential function as the solution to a differential equation:
Theorem 8.2.3. Let f : R →C be differentiable. Fix a,b ∈C. If f ′ = bf and f(0) =
a, then f(x) = aexp(bx) for all x ∈R.
Proof. Let g(x) = f(x)/exp(bx). By the quotient rule for derivatives
g′(x) = bf ′(x)exp(x)−f(x)bexp′(bx)
exp2(bx)
= 0
for all x. Consequently, g is a constant function. In particular, g(x) = g(0) = a for
all x.

Then log(1) = 0, log(e) = log(exp(1)) = 1, and 1 < log(4), so log(1) < log(e) <
log(4), and therefore 1 < e < 4, since log is an increasing function.
Exercise 8.2.5. Prove exp(p/q) = ep/q for any rational number p/q.
Exercise 8.2.5 shows that exp(r) = er when r is rational. Since exp is continuous
and Q is dense in R, it is natural to deﬁne
ex := exp(x) for all x in R.
More generally, for a > 0 deﬁne
ax := exlog(a) = exp(xlog(a)).
Prior to this deﬁnition we could only consider xr for rational r. The usual computa-
tional properties hold:
ax+y = exp((x+y)log(a))
= exp(xlog(a)+ylog(a))
= exp(xlog(a)) exp(ylog(a))
= axay

= xa ya
for all x,y > 0 and all a ∈R. We leave the statement and veriﬁcation of other familiar
properties of the functions x →ax and of x →xa to the interested reader.
Example 8.2.6. We will show that
ex =

∑
k=0
xk
k!, for all x ∈R.
In particular, setting x = 1 gives
e =

∑

Proof. Fix x. Since exp′ = exp it follows that exp(k) = exp for all k ∈N0. In partic-
ular, exp(k)(0) = 1 for all k. Hence, the nth Taylor polynomial for exp at 0 is
Tn(x) :=
n
∑
k=0
xk
k!
and the corresponding Lagrange Remainder is
Rn(x) := ec
xn+1
(n+1)!
for some c = c(n,x) between 0 and x. Since exp(x)−Tn(x) = Rn(x) we must show
Rn(x) →0 as n →∞. Note,
ec = ec(n,x) ≤max

e0,ex
for all n. Hence, we must show
xn+1
(n+1)! →0, as n →∞.

8.3 The Napier Constant e⋆
Irrationality of e was ﬁrst proven by Leonhard Euler (15 April 1707 Basel to
18 September 1783 St. Petersburg). Charles Hermite (24 December 1822 Dieuze,
Moselle to 14 January 1901 Paris), was the ﬁrst to prove that e is transcendental.
Euler named the Napier constant (John Napier 1550 Merchiston Tower to 4 April
1617 Edinburgh) after himself, calling it e. The ﬁrst reference to the constant was
published in 1618 in work on logarithms by Napier in the form of a table of log-
arithms based on e. The discovery of the constant e := exp(1) itself is credited to
Jacob Bernoulli, who attempted to ﬁnd the value of limn→∞

There are many proofs of this fact. The one I have chosen uses the idea used to show

difference of products of integers, hence an integer. The left hand side is > 0, hence
the right hand side is a natural number. But estimating the left hand side leads to a

Remark 8.3.2. Comparing to Remark 3.5.5 the equation x = y is Eq. (8.1).
Charles Hermite is perhaps best known for proving that e is transcendental.

8.3 The Napier Constant e⋆
163
Theorem 8.3.3 (Hermite 1873). The number e is transcendental.
Proof. Suppose e is algebraic. Let aj be integers such that
anen +an−1en−1 +···+a1e+a0 = 0.
(8.3)
We may assume a0 ̸= 0. If not we can reduce the degree of the polynomial by
dividing by e. Let
fp(x) := xp−1 (x−1)p (x−2)p ···(x−n)p
(p−1)!
where p is an integer > 1. Then fp is a polynomial of degree (n+1) p −1, some-
times called the Hermite polynomial. Let
Fp(x) :=
(n+1)p−1
∑
j=0
f ( j)
p (x),
(8.4)
where f ( j)
p
is fp differentiated j times. Then
F′
p(x)−Fp(x) =
(n+1)p−1
∑
j=1
f ( j)
p (x)−
(n+1)p−1
∑
j=0
f ( j)
p (x) = −fp(x),
since f (np+p)

(x) = 0. It follows that

Fp(x)e−x′ =

F′
p(x)−Fp(x)

e−x = −fp(x)e−x.
Using the fundamental theorem of calculus we get
ˆ m

fp(x)e−xdx = Fp(0)−Fp(m)e−m.
Multiply by amem and sum over m = 0,1,...,n we get

Where we used the sum ∑n
m=0 amemFp(0) is = 0 by (8.3).
To complete the proof we will show (a) that the left hand side of (8.2) converges
to zero as p →∞and (b) that the right hand side of (8.2) is a non-zero integer for an
inﬁnite number of integers p. This is a contradiction, hence verifying the claims (a)
and (b) completes the proof.

Consequently, the left hand side of (8.2) converges to zero as p →∞.
(b) Conceptual Version: By deﬁnition of fp(x), each f (i)
p (m) is an integer, divisi-
ble by p except when m = 0 and j = p−1.
In fact, when m ̸= 0 the only non-zero terms in f ( j)
p (m) are from terms where the
factor (x−m)p has been differentiated exactly p times, and then p! cancels (p−1)!
leaving a factor of p.
When m = 0 the only non-zero terms in f ( j)
p (m) = f ( j)
p (0) are from terms where
the factor xp−1 has been differentiated exactly p−1 times giving a factor of (p−1)!.
If j ≥p, then one of the terms (x−m)p with m ̸= 0 has been differentiated at least
once giving an additional factor of p, yielding a factor of p! as before. Finally, when
j = p−1 and m = 0 we get f (p−1)
p
(0) = (−1)p...(−n)p.
So
n
∑
m=0
amFp(m) = a0(−1)p...(−n)p + pM
where M is an integer derived from all the non-zero terms, where m ̸= 0 or where
m = 0 and j ≥p. If p is a prime > n and > |a0|, then the term a0(−1)p...(−n)p is not
divisible by p. Thus ∑n
m=0 amFp(m) is a non-zero integer. This completes the proof.
(b) Computational Version: Write
(p−1)!· fp(x) = g0(x)g1(x)···gn(x),

8.3 The Napier Constant e⋆
165
where g0(x) := xp−1 and gi(x) := (x−i)p for 1 ≤i ≤n. It follows from the product
rule that
(p−1)!· f ( j)
p (x) =
∑
j0+ j1+···+ jn= j
g( j0)

(x)g( j1)

(x)···g( jn)
n
(x),
(8.7)
where the sum is over all vectors (j0, j1,..., jn) of integers ji ≥0 such that j0 + j1 +
···+ jn = j.
Repeatedly differentiating g0 we see that
g(k)
0 (x) = (p−1)(p−2)···(p−k)xp−k−1
(8.8)
when 1 ≤k ≤p−1 and g(k)
0 (x) = 0 when p−1 < k. By (8.8)
g(k)
0 (m) =

(p−1)(p−2)···(p−k))mp−k−1
if 0 ≤k ≤p−1
0
if k > p−1
.
(8.9)
The boundary cases k = 0 and k = p −1 are interpreted as g(0)
0 (m) = mp−1 and
g(p−1)
0
(m) = (p−1)!.
Let 1 ≤i ≤n. Repeatedly differentiating gi we see that
g(k)
i (x) = p(p−1)(p−2)···(p−k +1)(x−i)p−k
(8.10)
when 1 ≤k ≤p and g(k)
i (x) = 0 when p < k. By (8.10), if 1 ≤i ≤n, then
g(k)
i (m) =

p(p−1)···(p−k +1))mp−k
if 0 ≤k ≤p
0
if k > p
.
(8.11)
The boundary cases k = 0 and k = p are interpreted as g(0)
i (m) = (m−i)p and
g(p)
i
(m) = p!. Note, g(k)
i (m) is an integer for all 0 ≤i ≤n, all 0 ≤k, and all
0 ≤m ≤n. Setting x = m in (8.7) gives
(p−1)!· f ( j)
p (m) =
∑
j0+ j1+···+ jn= j
g( j0)
0
(m)g( j1)
1
(m)···g( jn)
n
(m).
(8.12)
For m = 0, it follows from (8.9) that g(k)
0 (0) = 0 if k ̸= p −1 and g(p−1)
0
(0) =
(p−1)!. So using (8.12) it follows that f ( j)
p (0) = 0 when j < p−1 and when p−
1 ≤j only the terms with j0 = p −1 in the sum (8.12) can be non-zero. Since
g(p−1)
0
(0) = (p−1)! all the terms in the sum (8.12) with j0 = p−1 have a factor of
(p−1)!. So for p−1 ≤j, (8.12) can be written as
f ( j)
p (0) =
∑
j1+···+ jn= j−p+1
g( j1)

(0)g( j2)

(0)···g( jn)

8 The Logarithm and the Exponential Function
Hence, in either case j < p−1 or p−1 ≤j, f ( j)
p (0) is an integer. By (8.4) Fp(0) is
an integer.
Fix 1 ≤m ≤n. It follows from (8.11) that g(k)
m (m) = 0 if k ̸= p and g(p)
m (m) = p!.
So using (8.12) it follows that f ( j)
p (m) = 0 = p·0 when j < p and when p ≤j only
the terms with jm = p in the sum (8.12) can be non-zero. Since g(p)
m (m) = p! all
the terms in the sum (8.12) with jm = p have a factor of p!. In either case j < p or
p ≤j, f ( j)
p (m) is an integer multiple of p. By (8.4)
Fp(m) is an integer multiple of p when 1 ≤m ≤n.
(8.14)
Since f ( j)
p (m) is an integer for all 0 ≤j and all 0 ≤m ≤n, it follows from
(8.4) that Fp(m) is an integer. Hence the right hand side −∑n
m=0 amFp(m) of (8.2) is
an integer. To complete the proof we must show that the integer ∑n
m=0 amFp(m) is
non-zero for an inﬁnite number of p. We will complete the proof by showing that
∑n
m=0 amFp(m) is not a multiple of p for inﬁnitely many p.
If m ̸= 0, then Fp(m) is a multiple of p by (8.14). Hence we must show that
a0Fp(0) is not a multiple of p for inﬁnitely many p. Since f j)
p (0) = 0 when j < p−1,
it follows from (8.4) and (8.13) that
Fp(0) =
(n+1)p−1
∑
j=p−1
f ( j)
p (0) =
(n+1)p−1
∑
j=p−1
∑
j1+···+ jn= j−p+1
g( j1)
1
(0)···g( jn)
n
(0).
If ji > 0 for some 1 ≤i ≤n, then it follows from (8.11) that g( ji)
i
(0) is a multiple of
p. Hence,
Fp(0) = g1(0)···gn(0)+ pM
for some integer M. So
a0Fp(0) = a0 (−1)p (−2)p ···(−n)p + pa0M.
Consequently, if p is a prime and p > max{|a0|,n}, then a0Fp(0) is not a multiple
of p.

8.4 Bump Functions⋆
The purpose of this section is to construct a function φ : R →R, such that
•
0 ≤φ(x) ≤1 for all x in R
•
φ(0) = 1
•
φ(x) = 0 for all |x| ≥1
•
φ is C ∞on R
Such a function is called a bump function. See Fig. 8.1.

xn
ex →0 as x →∞.
Hence, if p is a polynomial, then
p(x)

→0 as x →∞.
If 1 < x, then x < x2, so ex < ex2. Consequently,
0 ≤|p(x)|
ex2
≤|p(x)|
ex
→0 as x →∞.
Since, 1/t →∞as t ↘0 it follows that for any polynomial p
p(1/t)e−1/t2 →0 as t ↘0.
A similar argument yields the same conclusion for t ↗0.

Step 3: (Euler) Let
ψ(x) :=

e−1/x2
when 0 < x
0
when x ≤0 .
Clearly, ψ is C ∞on R\{0}. See Fig. 8.2.

•
ψ is continuous at 0, by Step 1 with p(1/x) := 1, i.e., p(t) = 1.
•
ψ is differentiable at 0 and ψ′(0) = 0, because
ψ(x)−ψ(0)
x−0
= 1
xψ(x) →0 as x →0
by Step 1 with p(1/x) = 1/x, i.e., p(t) = t.
•
ψ′ is differentiable at 0 and ψ′′(0) = 0, because
ψ′(x)−ψ′(0)
x−0

x
→0 as x →0
by Step 1 with p(1/x) = q1(1/x)/x, i.e., with p(t) = tq1(t).
Exercise 8.4.2. Show that for any n ∈N0, the nth derivative of ψ exists at 0 and
ψ(n)(0) = 0.
Remark 8.4.3. In particular, for any n, the Taylor polynomial Tnψ associated with ψ
at 0 is Tnψ(x) = 0.
Proposition 8.4.4. ψ maps ]−∞,0] onto {0} and ]0,∞[ onto ]0,1[.
Proof. Note −1/x2 is a strictly increasing function mapping ]0,∞[ onto ] −∞,0[.
Since exp is a strictly increasing function mapping ] −∞,0[ onto ]0,1[, the com-
position e−1/x2 = exp(−1/x2) is a strictly increasing function mapping ]0,∞[ onto
]0,1[.
Step 4: Let φ : R →R be determined by
φ(x) := e2ψ(1+x)ψ(1−x).
See Fig. 8.1.
•
φ is C ∞on R, since ψ is.
•
If x ≥1, 1 −x ≤0, so φ(x) = 0, since ψ(1 −x) = 0. Similarly, if x ≤−1, then
φ(x) = 0, since ψ(1+x) = 0.
•
φ(0) = e2ψ(1)ψ(1) = e2e−1e−1 = 1.
•
0 ≤φ(x) for all x, since 0 ≤ψ(x) for all x.

8.4 Bump Functions⋆
169
It remains to verify that φ(x) ≤1 for all x between −1 and 1.
Exercise 8.4.5. Prove φ ′(x) ≥0 when −1 < x < 0 and φ ′(x) ≤0 when 0 < x < 1.
It follows from the exercise above that φ(0) is the global maximum of φ on ]−1,1[.
Thus φ is a bump function.

First Recall a Bit of Linear Algebra

linearly independent and spans V.

k=1 a′
kbk =⇒ak = a′
k for k = 1,2,...,n.
A basic fact of linear algebra is that any vector space has a basis.
R as a Vector Space Over Q
Suppose B is a basis for R as a vector space over Q. If B is ﬁnite, then it follows,
that R is countable, hence B is not ﬁnite. The same argument shows that B is not
countable. See Chap. 4.
Let p1, p2,... be the primes. The numbers (vectors) log(p1), log(p2),... are lin-
early independent over the rationals.
Proof. Let c1,c2,...,cn be rationals such that
c1 log(p1)+c2 log(p2)+···+cn log(pn) = 0.
Multiplying by the common denominator of c1,c2,...,cn we may assume the c′

Chapter 9
Convergence of Sequences
This chapter covers convergence of numerical sequences in some detail. This is fol-
lowed by a discussion of convergence of sequences of functions, in particular, of
uniform convergence of a sequence of functions. Applications include, Leibnitz In-
tegral Rule, Fubini's Theorem, the Approximate Identity Lemma, and a proof of the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The later completes the discussion of polynomi-
als begun in Proposition 1.4.11.
9.1 Real and Complex Sequences
We discussed basic ideas related to sequences in Sects. 1.6 and 1.7. In this section
we will expand on these considerations. In the ﬁrst part of this section we discuss
sequences of complex numbers. Then we characterize continuity of a function in
terms convergence of sequences. Finally, we discuss properties of sequences that
require an order, hence we restrict attention to sequences of real numbers.
A sequence in a set X is a mapping from N to X. Instead of using function
notation it is customary to use subscripts for sequences. So, a sequence is a mapping
a : N →X and the value of the mapping at the positive integer n is a(n) = an. We
will usually write (an) or a1,a2,... in place of a : N →X. Two sequences are equal
if they are equal as functions, that is, (an) = (bn), if an = bn for all n ∈N.
Exercise 9.1.1. The sequences
1,2,3,2,3,2,3,... and 1,2,3,1,2,3,...
are not equal, because

{1,2,3,2,3,2,3,...} and {1,2,3,1,2,3,...}

9 Convergence of Sequences
Convergence
We discussed elementary properties of convergence of sequences in Sect. 1.6. For
emphasis we restate the deﬁnition here.
Deﬁnition 9.1.2. Let (an) be a sequence of points in C and let a ∈C. We say that
(an) is converges to a if
∀ε > 0,∃N ∈N,∀n ∈N,n > N =⇒|an −a| < ε.
If (an) converges to a, then we say that a is the limit of (an) and we write an →a,
an −→
n→∞a, liman = a, limn an = a, or limn→∞an = a. We say (an) is convergent, if
(an) converges to some point in C. We say (an) is divergent or diverges if (an) is
not convergent.
Note |an −a| < ε is equivalent to an ∈Bε(a). So we can rewrite the deﬁnition of
convergence as
∀ε > 0,∃N ∈N,n > N =⇒an ∈Bε(a).
Recall, from Sect. 1.6, as sequence converging to zero is called a null sequence.
Clearly,
Proposition 9.1.3. an →a iff (an −a) is null.
Recall, from Sect. 1.2, that a point p is an accumulation point of the set A, if there
are points in A\{p} arbitrarily close to p.
Exercise 9.1.4. Let A be a subset of C and let p ∈C. Then p is an accumulation
point of A if and only if there is a sequence of points an ∈A such that, an ̸= p for all
n and an →p.
Subsequences
If b1,b2,b3,... is obtained from a1,a2,a3,... by striking out some of the terms of
a1,a2,a3,..., then (bn) is a subsequence of (an).
Example 9.1.5. The sequence 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3,... is a subsequence of 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2,
3,... obtained by striking out the ﬁrst term. The sequence 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3,... is also
a subsequence of 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3,... obtained by striking out all the 1's, an inﬁnite
number of term, but still leaving an inﬁnite number of terms.
More formally, a sequence (bn) is a subsequence of the sequence (an), is there is a
strictly increasing function ϕ : N →N, such that bn = aϕ(n). It is customary to write
bn = ain, that is, a subsequence of (an) is usually denoted by (ain).
Exercise 9.1.6. in = ϕ(n) ≥n for all n.
Exercise 9.1.7. If an →L and (bn) = (ain), then bn = ain →L.

9.1 Real and Complex Sequences
179
Exercise 9.1.8. Basic facts about subsequences.
1. Any sequence is a subsequence of itself. What is ϕ?
2. A subsequence of a subsequence is a subsequence of the original sequence. That
is, if (cn) is a subsequence of (bn) and (bn) is a subsequence of (an), then (cn) is
a subsequence of (an). How are the ϕ's related?
3. If (bn) is the subsequence of (an) obtained by omitting the ﬁrst m terms, write a
formula for ϕ.
The following is one of the "big" theorems about sequences, so the proof must be
non-trivial.
Theorem 9.1.9 (Sequential Compactness, Bolzano-Weierstrass).
Any bounded
sequence of complex numbers has a convergent subsequence.
Proof. Let (xn) be a bounded sequence of real numbers. Since the sequence (xn)
is bounded it has a lower bound, i.e., there is a r such that r ≤xn for all n. The
sequence yn := xn −r is ≥0. If yin →b then xin = yin + r →b+ r. Hence, we may
assume xn ≥0 for all n.
Exercise 9.1.10. Why is there a positive integer m, such that the set A0 := {n ∈N |
m ≤xn < m+1} is inﬁnite?
Let d0 := m, then
A0 = {n ∈N | d0 ≤xn < d0 +1}.
Exercise 9.1.11. Why is there an m ∈{0,1,...,9}, such that the set A1 := {n ∈N |
d0.m ≤x0,n < d0.m+1/10} is inﬁnite?
Let d1 := m. Then
A1 = {n ∈N | d0.d1 ≤xn < d0.d1 +1/10}.
Since d0 ≤d0.d1 ≤xn < d0.d1 +1/10 ≤d0 +1 we conclude A1 ⊆A0.
Inductively, suppose k ∈N, and we have constructed dj ∈{0,1,...,9}, such that
Ak = {n ∈N | d0.d1 ···dk ≤xn < d0.d1 ···dk +1/10k}
is inﬁnite. Then there is m ∈{0,1,...,9}, such that the set Ak+1 := {n ∈N |
d0.d1 ···dkm ≤xn < d0.d1 ···dkm+1/10k+1} is inﬁnite. Let dk+1 := m, then
Ak+1 = {n ∈N | d0.d1 ···dkdk+1 ≤xn < d0.d1 ···dkdk+1 +1/10k+1
and Ak+1 ⊆Ak.
Let i1 be the smallest element of A1, i2 the smallest element of A2 \ {i1}, i3 the
smallest element of A3 \{i1,i2}, and so on. Let yn := xin.
Exercise 9.1.12. Why is (yn) a subsequence of (xn)?
Let b := d0.d1d2 ··· .

9 Convergence of Sequences
Exercise 9.1.13. Why does yn →b?
We have established Bolzano-Weierstrass for real sequences.
Exercise 9.1.14. Any bounded sequence of complex numbers has a convergent sub-
sequence.
This completes our proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.

Corollary 9.1.15 (Limit Point Compactness). A bounded inﬁnite set of complex
numbers has an accumulation point.
Proof. Let D be a bounded inﬁnite set. Let x1 ∈D, let x2 ∈D \ {x1}, let x3 ∈D \
{x1,x2}, and so on. Since D is inﬁnite the process does not stop after a ﬁnite number
of step, hence we get a sequence (xn). The sequence (xn) is bounded, since D is
bounded. Hence (xn) has a convergent subsequence (xin). The limit of (xin) is an
accumulation point of D.

Exercise 9.1.16. Prove the last claim in the proof of Limit Point Compactness.
Cauchy Sequences
A sequence (xn) of complex numbers is Cauchy, if given any ε > 0, there exists
N = N(ε) such that ∀m,n ∈N,
m,n ≥N =⇒|xm −xn| < ε.
Exercise 9.1.17. Any convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.
The main result in Cauchy sequences is that the converse is true, this is Theo-
rem 9.1.21. The proof is an application of Limit Point Compactness.
Lemma 9.1.18. Let (xn) be a Cauchy sequence of complex numbers. If some subse-
quence (xin) of (xn) is convergent, then (xn) is convergent.
Exercise 9.1.19. Prove the Lemma.
Exercise 9.1.20. Any Cauchy sequence is bounded.
As a consequence of sequential compactness we have:
Theorem 9.1.21 (Cauchy Completeness). Any Cauchy sequence of complex num-
bers is convergent to a complex number.
Exercise 9.1.22. Prove the Theorem.
Verifying that a sequence is convergent using the deﬁnition of convergence requires
us to "guess" the limit. Verifying that a sequence is Cauchy does not require us to
know the value of the limit. Consequently, it is sometimes simpler to show that a
sequence is convergent by showing it is Cauchy.

|xn+1 −xn| ≤

for all n ≥1. Where the equality used x2 = 1/2, so that x1 −x2 = 1/2. Hence, if

Consequently, (xn) is Cauchy and therefore convergent.
It remains to determine the limit. Suppose xn →L. Since xn ≥0 we have L ≥0.
Also, xn+1 →L and by the algebra of limits

1+xn →

1+L, using 1 + L ̸= 0. Hence
xn+1 =

Remark 9.1.24. The argument, used to show that if |xn+1 −xn| ≤1

all n ≥2, then (xn) is Cauchy, is a standard technique.

9 Convergence of Sequences
Sequences and Continuity
Deﬁnition 9.1.25. Let M and N be subsets of the complex plane. Let f : M →N be
a function and let a ∈M. We say that f is sequentially continuous at a, if (f(an))
converges to f(a), whenever (an) converges to a.
We will show that a function is continuous if and only if it is sequentially continuous.
As an application, we show that the sequence determined by x1 := 1 and xn+1 :=
√1+xn is Cauchy and use sequential continuity of the function f(y) = √1+y to
ﬁnd the limit of (xn).
Theorem 9.1.26 (Sequential Continuity). Let D be a subset of the complex plane
f : D →C and a ∈D. Then f is continuous at a iff an ∈D and an →a implies
f(an) →f(a).
Proof. Suppose f is continuous at a and an →a. Let ε > 0 be given. Pick δ > 0
such that |x −a| < δ implies |f(x) −f(a)| < ε. Pick N such that n ≥N implies
|an −a| < δ. Then n ≥N =⇒|an −a| < δ =⇒| f(an)−f(a)| < ε.
Conversely, suppose f is not continuous at a. Since f is not continuous at a
there is an ε > 0 so that for any δ > 0 there is at least one x ∈BM(a,δ) such
that f(x) /∈BN( f(a),ε). Let δ = 1
n, there is an an ∈D such that |a −an| < 1
n and
|f(a)−f(an)| ≥ε. Consequently, an →a and f(an) ̸→f(a).

Proof. As in Example 9.1.23 we begin by showing that (xn) is Cauchy. By induction
xn ≥1 for all n. Let f(y) := √1+y. Then xn+1 = f(xn) and f ′(y) =
1
2√1+y ≤1

all y ≥0. By the Mean Value Theorem
|xn+1 −xn| = |f(xn)−f(xn−1)|

Repeating an argument from Example 9.1.23 it follows that (xn) is Cauchy.
Let L := limn→∞xn. Since f is continuous f(xn) →f(L) by sequential continuity.
Hence xn+1 = f(xn) implies L = f(L), that is L = √1+L. Solving this equation for
its positive root gives L =

Monotone Sequences in R
A sequence (xn) of real numbers is increasing, if xn ≤xn+1 for all n, it is strictly
increasing, if xn < xn+1 for all n. If xn ≥xn+1 (resp. xn > xn+1) for all n, then (xn) is
decreasing (resp. strictly decreasing). A sequence is monotone, if it is increasing or
decreasing. Similarly, a sequence is strictly monotone if it is either strictly increasing
or strictly decreasing.
The following result is similar to Exercise 5.1.2.
Theorem 9.1.28 (Monotone Convergence). If (an) is increasing, then an →sup{an |
n ∈N}.
Proof. There are two cases. sup{an | n ∈N} < ∞and sup{an | n ∈N} = ∞.
Suppose sup{an | n ∈N} < ∞. In this case {an | n ∈N} is bounded and b :=
sup{an | n ∈N} < ∞is the least upper bound for {an | n ∈N}. For any ε > 0,
b −ε < b, so b −ε is not an upper bound for {an | n ∈N}. Hence, for some N,
b−ε < aN. Since (an) is increasing, b−ε < aN ≤an, for all n ≥N. Consequently,
0 ≤b−an < ε for all n ≥N.
Thus an →b.
Suppose sup{an | n ∈N} = ∞. In this case {an | n ∈N} does not have an upper
bound. So for any K, there is an N, such that K < aN. Since (an) is increasing
K < aN ≤an for all n ≥N.
Thus an →∞.

Corollary 9.1.29. If (an) is decreasing, then an →inf{an | n ∈N}.
Proof. Applying the theorem to (−an), gives
−an →sup{−an | n ∈N} = −inf{an | n ∈N}.
Hence an application of the theorem completes the proof.

Example 9.1.30. It follows from monotone convergence that 0 < r < 1 implies rn →
0. We already established this in Sect. 1.7 using a different argument.
Proof. Let an := rn. Multiplying r < 1 by rn gives an+1 = rn+1 < rn = an, so (an)
is decreasing and bounded below by 0. Hence, by monotone convergence, an = rn
is convergent to L := inf{rn | n ∈N} as n →∞. It remains to show that L = 0.
Since r > 0, an = rn > 0, in particular, L ≥0. Now bn := an+1 = rn+1 is a subse-
quence of (an), hence bn →L. But bn = ran →rL. Since a sequence has at most one
limit L = rL. So (1−r)L = L−rL = 0. Consequently, 1−r ̸= 0 implies L = 0.

Limit Superior and Limit Inferior
Recall, from Sect. 1.2 and the beginning of this section, that a point p is an ac-
cumulation point of the set A, if there are points in A \ {p} arbitrarily close to p.
The following is a related notion for sequences of complex numbers, it requires that
there are arbitrarily large subscripts for which xk is close to p, and allows xk = p for
those subscripts:
Deﬁnition 9.1.31. Let xj ∈C. A point p ∈C is a limit point of (xj), if
∀ε > 0, ∀m ∈N, ∃j ∈N, j ≥m and |x j −p| < ε
Example 9.1.32. Some examples of limits points of sequences are:
1. 1 and 2 are limit points of the sequence 0,1,2,1,2,1,2,...
2. 0 and 1 are limit points of the sequence 1
2, 1, 1
4, 1, 1
8, ...; i.e., of the sequence
(xn) determined by xn :=

1
2n
if n is odd
1
if n is even .
3. 1 is a limit point of the sequence (yn) determined by
yn :=

1
if n is a power of 2
n
if n is not a power of 2 .
For the related sets we have:
4. The set {0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,...} = {0,1,2} does not have any accumulation points.
5. 0 is the only accumulation point of the set {xn | n ∈N} =

1, 1
2, 1
4,...

.
6. The inﬁnite set {yn | n ∈N} does not have any accumulation points.
Theorem 9.1.33. Let (xn) be a sequence and let p be a point. Then p is a limit point
of (xj) iff there exists a subsequence (xin) such that xin →p as n →∞.
Proof. Suppose there is a subsequence (xin) such that xin →p as n →∞. Let ε >
0 and m ∈N be given. Pick N such that |xin −p| < ε for all n ≥N. Then n =
max{N,m} implies |xin −p| < ε. Since in ≥n ≥m it follows that p is a limit point
of (xn).
Conversely, suppose p is a limit point of (xn). Setting ε = 1 and m = 1 gives n1 :=
j ≥1 such that |p−xn1| < 1. Setting ε = 1/2 and m = 1+n1 gives n2 := j ≥1+n1
such that |p−xn2| < 1/2. Setting ε = 1/3 and m = 1 + n2 gives n3 := j ≥1 + n2
such that
p−xn3
 < 1/3. Continuing in this manner we get n1 < n2 < n3 < ··· such
that
p−xnk
 < 1/k. Thus

is a subsequence of (xk) converging to p.

Suppose (xk) is a sequence of real numbers. Let
yk := sup{x j | j ≥k}.
The sequence (yk) is decreasing, in fact, yk+1 ≤yk, since {xj | j ≥k+1} is a subset
of {x j | j ≥k}. By monotone convergence limk→∞yk exists, it might equal −∞. We

9.1 Real and Complex Sequences
185
deﬁne the limit superior of the sequence (x j) to be
limsup
j→∞
xj := lim
k→∞yk = lim
k→∞sup
j≥k
xj,
where supj≥k xj = sup

xj | j ≥k

. We will also write
lim
j→∞xj := limsup
j→∞
xj.
Example 9.1.34. Let xj := 1+(−1)j 1
j for all integers j ≥1. Then
yk = sup



if k is odd ,
hence limsupj→∞xj = limk→∞yk = 1. Mixing in some numbers smaller than one
does not change the limit superior. For example, if b2 j−1 := 1+(−1)j 1
j and b2 j :=
(−1)j 1
j for all j ∈N, then limsupj→∞bj = 1.
Exercise 9.1.35. If xk := −k, then limj→∞xj = −∞.
Proposition 9.1.36. If (x j) is a bounded sequence of real numbers, then limsupxj
is a limit point of (x j).
Proof. Let y := limsupj→∞xj and yk := sup

xj | j ≥k

. Let ε > 0 and m be given.
Pick N such that k ≥N implies |y−yk| < ε/2. Let k := max{N,m}. Since yk −ε
2 is
not an upper bound for {xj | j ≥k} there is a j ≥k such that yk −ε
2 < xj ≤yk. Now
j ≥k ≥m and
|x j −y| ≤|xj −yk|+|yk −y| < ε
2 + ε
2 = ε.
Thus y is a limit point of (x j).

The limit superior of a sequence is its largest limit point:
Proposition 9.1.37. Let (xj) be a sequence of real numbers. If p is a limit point of
the sequence (xj), then p ≤limsupxj.
Proof. Let p be some limit point of (xj) and let y := limsupj→∞xj be the limit
superior of (x j). We need to show that p ≤y. Let yk := sup{x j | j ≥k} and let (xn j)
be some subsequence converging to p. Now xnk ∈{xj |j ≥k} since nk ≥k. Hence
xnk ≤yk. Since xnk →p and yk →y as k →∞we have p ≤y.

Similar to the deﬁnition of the limit superior, the sequence
zk = inf
j≥kxj := inf

x j | j ≥k

is an increasing sequence and we deﬁne the limit inferior by

186
9 Convergence of Sequences
limxj = liminf
j→∞xj := lim
k→∞inf
j≥kxj = lim
k→∞zk.
The reader may verify that the limit inferior of a sequence is its smallest limit point.
Since inf{xj |j ≥k} ≤sup{xj |j ≥k} for all k, we have
liminf
k→∞xk ≤limsup
k→∞
xk.
Example 9.1.38. If x1,x2,x3,... is an enumeration of the rationals in [0,1], then den-
sity of rationals implies that every point in [0,1] is a limit point of the sequence (xn).
Below we give alternative characterizations of the limit superior and the limit in-
ferior of sequences. These characterizations are motivated by a restatement of the
deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence.
Lemma 9.1.39. If p,xn are of real numbers, then xn →p as n →∞iff for any ε > 0
the sets {k | xk < p−ε} and {k | p+ε < xk} both are ﬁnite.
Proof. Follows directly from the deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence.

Exercise 9.1.40. Suppose (xn) is a bounded sequence of real numbers. A real num-
ber t is the limit superior of (xk) iff for any ε > 0 (i) the set {k | t −ε < xk} is inﬁnite
and (ii) the set {k | t +ε < xk} is ﬁnite.
Exercise 9.1.41. Suppose (xn) is a bounded sequence of real numbers. A real num-
ber t is the limit inferior of (xk) iff for any ε > 0 (i) the set {k | t −ε < xk} is ﬁnite
and (ii) the set {k | t +ε < xk} is inﬁnite.
The following characterization of the existence of the limit of a sequence in term
of limsup and liminf is a direct consequence of Lemma 9.1.39, Exercise 9.1.40 and
Exercise 9.1.41. We give a different proof below.
Theorem 9.1.42. Let (xj) be a sequence of real numbers. The sequence (x j) is con-
vergent iff liminfk→∞xk = limsupk→∞xk.
Proof. Suppose liminfk→∞xk = limsupk→∞xk. Let
x := liminf
k→∞xk = limsup
k→∞
xk.
Let yk := sup j≥k xj and zk := inf j≥k xj. Then
zk ≤xj ≤yk for j ≥k.
In particular, zk ≤xk ≤yk, since zk →x and yk →x, then xk →x.
Conversely, suppose xn →x. Since the limit superior is a limit point there is a
subsequence (xin) of (xn) such that xin →limsupk→∞xk. Since a subsequence has the
same limit a the "mother" sequence x = limsupk→∞xk. Similarly, the limit inferior
equals x.

Example 9.1.43. If an := (−1)n+1 and bn := −an, then an + bn = 0 for all n and
limsupan = limsupbn = 1. Consequently, limsup(an +bn) = 0 < 2 = (limsupan)+
(limsupbn).
Similarly, limsup(anbn) = −1 < 1 = (limsupan)(limsupbn).
9.2 Sequences of Functions
In this section, we discuss pointwise and uniform convergence of sequences of func-
tions. We also discuss how pointwise and uniform convergence interacts with the
basic notions of calculus: continuity, the derivative, and the integral. Uniform con-
vergence is important because it allows us to establish several results about inter-
changing two limits.
Uniform Convergence
Let D be a subset of the complex plane. Suppose fn, f : D →C. If for every x in D,
fn(x) →f(x) as n →∞, then fn converges pointwise to f on D. In symbols
∀x ∈D,∀ε > 0,∃N = N(x,ε) > 0,n ≥N =⇒| fn(x)−f(x)| < ε.
Uniform convergence on D requires N to be independent of x. More precisely, the
sequence fn converges uniformly to f on D provided
∀ε > 0,∃N = N(ε) > 0,∀x ∈D,n ≥N =⇒| fn(x)−f(x)| < ε.
See Fig. 9.1. We will write fn →f, if fn converges pointwise to f, and fn ⇒f, if
fn converges uniformly to f. To emphasize this notation:
fn →f
pointwise convergence
fn ⇒f
uniform convergence
Example 9.2.1. Let fn(x) := x/n and f(x) := 0. Then
(i) fn converges pointwise to f on R,
(ii) fn does not converge uniformly to f on R, and
(iii) fn converges uniformly to f on any compact interval [a,b].
Proof. (i) Fix x. Let ε > 0 be given. Pick N such that |x|
N < ε. (For example, let
N := 1+ |x|
ε .) Then n ≥N implies |fn(x)| = |x|
n ≤|x|
N < ε.
(ii) Let ε := 1. Let N be given. Let n := N and x := N +1, then fN(x) = N+1


Uniform Convergence and Continuity
Uniform convergence is of interest because uniform convergence passes some nice
properties of the functions fn on to the limit function f. We establish some examples
below.
Example 9.2.2. Let
fn(x) :=
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩
−1
if x < −1
n
nx
if −1
n ≤x ≤1
n
1
if 1
n < x
and f(x) :=
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩
−1
if x < 0
0
if x = 0
1
if 0 < x
,
then each fn is continuous on R, f is not continuous at 0, and fn →f. See Fig. 9.2.
The example shows that the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions
need not be continuous, but the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions
is a continuous function. Since continuity of g at x0 means g(x) →g(x0) as x →x0
we can think of this result as being about interchanging two limits: the limit in n and
the limit in x.
Theorem 9.2.3. Let f, fn : D →C and let x0 ∈D. Suppose fn ⇒f on D.
1. If each fn is continuous at x0, then f is continuous at x0.
2. If each fn is uniformly continuous on D, then f is uniformly continuous on D.

Fig. 9.2 Illustrating that fn does not converge uniformly to f in Example 9.2.2. The ﬁgure shows
f, the band f(x)−ε < g(x) < f(x)+ε with ε = 1
3, and the functions fn, n = 1,2,3
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. [The proof is in two steps, ﬁrst we ﬁnd a good N, then
we ﬁnd δ.] By the triangle inequality
|f(x)−f(x0)| ≤| f(x)−fn(x)|+|fn(x)−fn(x0)|+|fn(x0)−f(x0)|.
Since ε/3 > 0, uniform convergence gives an N, such that |f(t)−fN(t)| < ε/3 for
all t in D. Hence
|f(x)−f(x0)| < ε
3 +|fN(x)−fN(x0)|+ ε
3.
Since fN is continuous at x0 and ε/3 > 0, there is a δ > 0, such that |x −x0| < δ
implies |fN(x)−fN(x0)| < ε/3. Hence
|x−x0| < δ =⇒| f(x)−f(x0)| < ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3 = ε.
This proves the ﬁrst part.

Exercise 9.2.4. Prove the second part of the theorem.
Uniform Convergence and Integrals
We show pointwise limits of integrable functions need not be integrable and that
uniform limits of integrable functions are integrable.
Exercise 9.2.5. Let (xn) be an enumeration of the rationals in the interval [0,1]. Let
fn(x) = 0 except fn(x) = 1 for x ∈{x1,...,xn}. Prove each fn is integrable and the
pointwise limit function is not integrable.
Theorem 9.2.6. If fn : [a,b] →R are integrable and converge uniformly to f, then
f is integrable and
´ b
a fn →
´ b
a f.

Proof. We cannot use the Evaluation Theorem for Integrals (Theorem 7.2.5), be-
cause we have not assumed that I = limn→∞
´ b
a fn exists.
Let ε > 0 be given. Let N be so large that n ≥N implies |fn(x)−f(x)| <

3(b−a),
for all x ∈[a,b]. Let sn (resp. Sn) be a lower (resp. upper) step function for fn, such
that ∑Sn −∑sn < ε
3. Then
f(x) < fn(x)+
ε
3(b−a) ≤Sn(x)+
ε
3(b−a),for all x ∈[a,b].
So S = Sn +

3(b−a) is an upper step function for f. Similarly, s = sn −

3(b−a) is a
lower step function for f. But

It follows from Theorem 7.2.3 that f is integrable. Furthermore, for n ≥N we have
∑s ≤∑sn ≤
ˆ b

fn ≤∑Sn ≤∑S
and
∑s ≤

So both

Consequently,


Remark 9.2.7. The proof does not use that the fn's form a sequence. For example,
a very similar proof shows that, if ft is integrable on [a,b] for all t and ft ⇒f as
t →t0, then f is integrable on [a,b] and
´ b
a ft →
´ b
a f.
Here ft ⇒f as t →t0 means
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀x ∈[a,b],0 < |t −t0| < δ =⇒| ft(x)−f(x)| < ε.
We just replaced the discrete parameter n with the continuous parameter t in the
deﬁnition of uniform convergence. This is similar to some of the variations on limits
in Sects. 1.5 and 1.6.
Remark 9.2.8. We can rewrite the limit

Since the integral is a kind of limit process, this is an example of interchanging two
limits.
Uniform Convergence and Derivatives
The following result is about a sequence of differentiable functions passing differ-
entiability on to the limit function.
Corollary 9.2.9. Let fn, f, and g be real valued functions deﬁned on some interval
I. If each fn have a continuous derivative on I, the sequence fn converges pointwise
to f on I, and the sequence f ′
n converges uniformly to g on I, then f is differentiable
on I and f ′ = g.
One can prove this without using integrals, done this way the proof is a bit tedious.
We hide the complications by using the theory of the Riemann integral.
Proof. Let x and x0 be points in I. By the FTC-Evaluation we can write
fn(x) = fn(x0)+
ˆ x
x0
f ′
n.
Letting n →∞we get
f(x) = f(x0)+
ˆ x
x0
g
where we used the pointwise convergence of fn and the uniform convergence of f ′
n.
Now g is continuous, since it is the uniform limit of continuous functions. Conse-
quently, it follows from FTC-Derivative that f ′ = g.

Partial Derivatives
Given a function g : [a,b] × [c,d] →R of two variables, supposing y →g(x,y) is
integrable for each x we can consider the function
f(x) :=
ˆ d
c
g(x,y)dy
deﬁned for x ∈[a,b]. Imposing suitable conditions on g we establish continuity and
differentiability of the function f.
Exercise 9.2.10. If g : [a,b] × [c,d] →R is continuous, then f(x) =
´ d
c g(x,y)dy is
continuous [a,b] →R.

192
9 Convergence of Sequences
If g is a function of two variables, for example g(x,y), then gx = ∂xg = ∂g
∂x is the
derivative of g with respect to the ﬁrst variable, that is
gx(s,t) := lim
h→0
g(s+h,t)−g(s,t)
h
.
The function gx is called a partial derivative of g. The partial derivative with respect
to the second variable gy is deﬁned in a similar manner. We can now establish a
result about interchanging integration and differentiation. This is one of Gottfried
Wilhelm von Leibniz (1 July 1646, Leipzig to 14 November 1716, Hanover) many
contributions to the early development of Calculus.
Theorem 9.2.11 (Leibniz Integral Rule). Suppose g : R×[c,d] →C is continuous
and that the partial derivative gx exists and is continuous on R×[c,d]. Let f : R →C
be determined by
f(t) :=
ˆ d
c
g(t,y)dy,
then f is differentiable on R and
f ′(t) :=
ˆ d
c
gx(t,y)dy.
Proof. Fix a point t0. Clearly,
f(t)−f(t0)
t −t0
=
ˆ d
c
g(t,y)−g(t0,y)
t −t0
dy.
Hence, if we know
g(t,y)−g(t0,y)
t −t0
⇒gx (t0,y) as t →t0,
the convergence being uniform in y, then we can ﬁnish the proof by interchanging
the limit and the integral (Theorem 9.2.6).
By the Mean Value Theorem there is an st,y between t0 and t such that
g(t,y)−g(t0,y)
t −t0
= gx(st,y,y).
(Note, we do not know anything about sh,y except it is between t and t0. For example,
there is no reason to think y →st,y is continuous or even integrable.) To complete
the proof, we will show gx(st,y,y) converges uniformly (in y) to gx(t0,y) as t →t0.
Let ε > 0 be given. We must ﬁnd a δ > 0, not depending on y, such that
|t −t0| < δ implies
gx(st,y,y)−gx(t0,y)
 < ε.

9.2 Sequences of Functions
193
By uniform continuity of gx on [t0 −1,t0 + 1] × [c,d] (Exercise 5.4.7), there is
a 0 < δ < 1 such that |(u,v)−(α,β)| < δ implies |gx(u,v)−gx(α,β)| < ε for all
pairs of points (u,v) and (α,β) in [t0 −1,t0 +1]×[c,d].
If |t −t0| < δ, then |st,y −t0| < δ, since st,y is between t and t0. Hence
(st,y,y)−(t0,y)
 =
st,y −t0
 < δ
and consequently
gx(st,y,y)−gx(t0,y)
 < ε as we needed to show. (We chose δ < 1
to force st,y to be in [t0 −1,t0 +1].)

after Guido Fubini (19 January 1879, Venice to 6 June 1943, New York City), shows
that these two integrals are equal. The version below was established by Paul David
Gustav du Bois-Reymond (2 December 1831, Berlin to 7 April 1889, Freiburg) in
1872, 30 years prior to the publication of Fubini's work.

9.3 Convolution
Let f,g be functions deﬁned on the real line. Suppose f,g are integrable on any
compact interval and one is = 0 outside some compact interval, then the convolution
of f and g is
f ∗g(x) =
ˆ ∞
−∞
f(x−y)g(y)dy.
(9.1)
The integral is not improper: If g = 0 outside [a,b], the integral is over the interval
[a,b]. If f = 0 outside [a,b] the integral is over the interval [x −b,x −a]. Equa-
tion (9.1) used that the product of two integrable functions is integrable and that if
f is integrable, so is g(x) := f(a−x) for any constant a.
The change of variables u = x−y shows that f ∗g = g∗f. The reader may state
and verify other basic algebraic properties of convolution, for example, f ∗(g∗h) =
(f ∗g)∗h, f ∗(g+h) = ( f ∗g)+(f ∗h), and f ∗(ag) = a( f ∗g) for any constant a.
Exercise 9.3.1. Let f and g be continuous functions deﬁned on the real line. If one
of f and g is = 0 outside some bounded interval, then f ∗g is a continuous function
on the real line.

Exercise 9.3.2. If f is a continuous on R and f = 0 outside some compact interval,
then f is uniformly continuous on R.
Exercise 9.3.3. If f is a continuous on R and f = 0 outside some compact interval,
then f is bounded on R.
Theorem 9.3.4 (Approximate Identity Lemma).
Let (gn) be an approximate
identity and let f be continuous on R. If f = 0 outside some compact interval, then
f ∗gn converges uniformly (on R) to f as n →∞.
Proof. Since f is bounded on R, there is an M be such that |f(x)| ≤M for all x ∈R.
Let ε > 0 be given. Use the uniform continuity of f to pick δ > 0 so that |x−y| ≤
δ implies |f(x) −f(y)| < ε/2. Use property (3) of (gn) to pick N so that n ≥N

One reason that convolution is important is that the convolution of two functions
tends to inherit the "good" properties of both functions. For example:
Proposition 9.3.5. Suppose f ∈C 1(R) (i.e., f ′ exists and is continuous on R). If g
is continuous on R and = 0 outside some compact interval, then f ∗g ∈C 1(R) and
(f ∗g)′ = f ′ ∗g.
Proof. This is essentially a special case of Theorem 9.2.11. Suppose g = 0 outside
[c,d].
Let φ(x,y) := f(x−y)g(y), then φ and φx(t,y) = f ′(t −y)g(y) are continuous on
R×R. Since ( f ∗g)(t) =
´ d
c φx(t,y)dy Theorem 9.2.11, tells us that
(f ∗g)′(t) =
ˆ d
c
φx(t,y)dy = f ′ ∗g(t).
Finally, f ′ ∗g is continuous by Exercise 9.3.1.

Exercise 9.3.6. Suppose f ∈C 1(R) and = 0 outside some compact interval and g
is continuous on R, then f ∗g is differentiable on R and (f ∗g)′ = f ′ ∗g on R.

Combining this with the Approximate Identity Lemma we see that if the approxi-
mate identity (gn) consists of C 1−functions, then f ∗gn is a uniform approximation
of the continuous function f by C 1−functions.
9.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra⋆
This section is an application of iterated integrals and the uniform convergence the-
orem for integrals. We assume familiarity with polar coordinates z = reiθ for z ∈C
and with the exponential function eiθ, see Chap. 11.
Theorem 9.4.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra). Let p be a polynomial of
degree at least one. Then p(z) = 0 for some z ∈C.
Proof. Let p(z) = ∑n
k=0 akzk. Suppose an ̸= 0 and p(z) ̸= 0 for all z ∈C. Then g :
[0,∞)×[0,2π] →C determined by
g(r,ϑ) =

g(r,ϑ)dϑ. Then f ′(r) =
´ 2π

gr(r,ϑ)dϑ, by Theorem 9.2.11. Mul-
tiplying by ir and using (9.2) gives the ﬁrst equality below.
ir f ′(r) =
ˆ 2π
0
gϑ(r,ϑ)dϑ = g(r,2π)−g(r,0) = 0,
The middle equality uses FTC-Evaluation and the last equality is a consequence of
ei2π = ei0.
Hence f ′(r) = 0 for all r, thus f is constant. Speciﬁcally,
f(r) = f(0) = 2π
p(0) ̸= 0 for all r.

the convergence is uniform in θ, since the right hand side of (9.3) does not depend

uniformly in ϑ. Hence

By repeated applications of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Lemma
1.4.13 it follows that any polynomial is a product of linear factors:
Corollary 9.4.2. If p(z) = ∑n
k=0 akzk, n > 0 and an ̸= 0, then
p(z) = an(z−z1)(z−z2)···(z−zn)
for some z1,z2,...,zn in C.
Proof. Let z1 be a root of p. By Lemma 1.4.13 there is a polynomial p1 of degree
n−1 such that p(z) = (z−z1)p1(z). Similarly, if z2 is a root of p1, then p1(z) = (z−
z2)p2(z) where p2 has degree n−2. Hence p(z) = (z−z1)(z−z2)p2(z). Continuing
in this manner we see that
p(z) = (z−z1)(z−z2)···(z−zn)pn(z)
where pn has degree 0, hence pn is a constant. Expanding the product, and compar-
ing coefﬁcients to zn, it follows that pn(z) = an.

4. For a sequence (xn) of real or complex numbers, let L[(xn)] be the set of limits
of all convergent subsequences of (xn), hence
L[(xn)] := {b ∈R | xin →b, for some subsequence of (xn)}.
Let (an) be a sequence of real numbers. Let (bn) be a sequence of points in
L[(an)]. Suppose bn →b. Show b ∈L[(an)] by completing the following steps:
(a) If t ∈L[(an)] and ε > 0, then the set

Cauchy Sequences
5. Let (xn) be a sequence of complex numbers. If there is a constant c < 1, such
that
|xn+1 −xn| ≤c|xn −xn−1|
for all n ≥2, then (xn) is convergent.
6. If xn := log(n), then xn+1 −xn →0 and (xn) is not Cauchy.
7. Give an example of a sequence (xn) such that |xn+1 −xn| ≤1/n and (xn) is not
Cauchy.
Sequences and Continuity
8. Give an example of a continuous function f and a divergent sequence (an) such
that ( f(an)) is convergent.
To simplify the notation we will say that a sequence of points in A is convergent
in A, if the sequence is convergent and the limit is a point in A. That is, if A is a
subset of the complex plane, an ∈A for all n, and an →a for some a ∈A, then

9.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra⋆

we say (an) is convergent in A. For example, (1/n) is convergent in [0,2] and
(1/n) is not convergent in [0,2].
The goal of the following problems is to extend the sequential continuity theo-
rem slightly. Namely to establish
Corollary 9.4.3. Let M and N be subsets of the complex plane. Let f : M →N
be a function and let a ∈M. Suppose that (f(an)) is convergent in N, whenever
an →a in M. Then f is continuous at a.
9. Let f : M →N be a function and let a ∈M. Suppose xn →a =⇒(f(xn)) is
convergent. Let an →a and bn →a. If f(an) →c and f(bn) →d, prove that
c = d. [Hint: Let x1 := a1,x2 := b1, x3 := a2, x4 := b2, etc.]
10. Let f : M →N be a function and let a ∈M. Suppose xn →a =⇒(f(xn)) is
convergent. Let an →a. Prove f(an) →f(a). [Hint: Use the previous problem
with bn := a for all n.]
11. Prove the corollary above.
The next group of problems explore connections between uniform continuity
and sequences.
12. Let f : D →C. Then f is uniformly continuous on D iff for any sequences (xn)
and (yn) is D, xn −yn →0 implies f (xn)−f (yn) →0.
13. Let f : D →C be uniformly continuous on D. If (xn) is a Cauchy sequence in
D, then (f (xn)) is a Cauchy sequence in C.
14. Let f(x) := x2. Show f maps Cauchy sequences onto Cauchy sequences and
f is not uniformly continuous. [You may take the domain of f to be R or C.]
Hence the converse in the previous problem fails.
Monotone Sequences
15. Let xn := 1+n
1+2n.
(a) Use Monotone Convergence to prove that (xn) is convergent.
(b) Use the deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence to show that xn →1
2 as n →∞.
16. Let
xn :=

n+2 +···+ 1

Use Monotone Convergence to show that (xn) is convergent. The limit is log(2),
but you need not prove this fact.
17. Let (Tn exp)(x) be the nth Taylor polynomial of exp at x0 = 0. Prove the se-
quence ((Tn exp)(1)) is an increasing sequence converging to exp(1) = e.

quences of (an). Does there exists a sequence (an) in the closed interval [0,1]
such that
a. L(an) has three elements?
b. L(an) is countably inﬁnite?
c. L(an) is the set of rational numbers in [0,1]?
If you answers "yes" to one of the parts above, provide an example of such a
sequence. If you answer "no" prove that no such sequence can exist.

Solutions and Hints for the Exercises
Exercise 9.1.1. 2 ̸= 1, the fourth terms disagree. Both sets equal {1,2,3}.
Exercise 9.1.4. p is an accumulation point of A iff A∩B′
ε(p) ̸= /0 for all ε. So, if p
is an accumulation point of A, then for each n we can pick a point an in A∩B′
1/n(p).
Exercise 9.1.6. ϕ(1) ≥1 since ϕ(1) ∈N. Suppose n ∈N and ϕ(n) ≥n. Then
ϕ(n+1) > ϕ(n) since ϕ is strictly increasing and n+1 > n. Hence, ϕ(n+1) > n,
and consequently, ϕ(n+1) ≥n+1.
Exercise 9.1.7. Let ε > 0 be given. Pick N such that n ≥N implies |an −L| < ε.
Then n ≥N implies in ≥n ≥N, hence |ain −L| < ε.
Exercise 9.1.8. (1) ϕ(n) = n. (2) By composition. (3) ϕ(n) = n+m.
Exercise 9.1.10. Since (xn) is bounded and xn ≥0, there is an integer L, such
that 0 ≤xn < L for all n. Hence, N = L−1
j=0 {n ∈N | j ≤xn < j +1}. Since a ﬁnite
union of ﬁnite sets is a ﬁnite set, at least one of the sets {n ∈N | j ≤xn < j +1},
j = 0,1,...,L−1 must be inﬁnite.
Exercise 9.1.11. Similar to Exercise 9.1.10 using
A0 =
9(
m=0
{n ∈N | d0.m ≤xn < d0.m+1/10}.
Exercise 9.1.12. We must show i1 < i2 < i3 < ··· . Now i2 is the smallest element
of A2 \{i1} ⊆A1 \{i1}. Hence i2 is in A1. But i2 ̸= i1 and i1 is the smallest element
of A1, consequently i1 < i2.
Similarly, i3 is the smallest element of A3 \ {i1,i2} ⊆A2 \ {i1,i2}. Hence i3 is
in A2 \ {i1}. But i3 ̸= i2 and i2 is the smallest element of A2 \ {i1}, consequently
i2 < i3. The desired sequence of inequalities follows by induction.
Exercise 9.1.13. By construction yn and b are in the interval [d0.d1 ···dn, d0.d1 ···
dn + 1/10n] for all n. Since the interval has length 1/10n, we conclude |yn −b| ≤
1/10n for all n.
Exercise 9.1.14. If (xn + iyn) is bounded, then (xn) and (yn) are bounded. Since
(xn) is a bounded sequence of real numbers we just showed it has a convergent
subsequence (xin). Since (yin) is a bounded sequence of real numbers it has a con-

Exercise 9.1.19. If xin →x, then |x−xm| ≤|x−xin|+|xin −xm|.
Exercise 9.1.20. There is an N such that m,n ≥N implies |xm −xn| < 1. Hence
|xm| < 1+|xN| for all m ≥N.
Exercise 9.1.22. Cauchy =⇒bounded =⇒convergent subsequence. And con-
vergent subsequence implies convergent.
Exercise 9.1.40. Let t := limsupk→∞xk. Recall yk := sup{x j | k ≤j}. Since t −
ε < t and yk →t as k →∞, there is an N such that yk > t −ε when k ≥N. Since
yk = sup{xj | k ≤j} there is a j ≥k such that xj > t −ε. This gives (i).
Pick N such that bN < t +ε. Since xj ≤bN < t +ε for all j ≥N, we get (ii).
Conversely suppose (i) and (ii). By (i) yk = sup{xj | k ≤j} > t −ε. Hence
limyk ≥t −ε. Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, we concluded limyk ≥t. Similarly, (ii) im-
plies limyk ≤t.
Exercise 9.2.4. Similar to the ﬁrst part. Since fN is uniformly continuous the
same δ works for all x0.
Exercise 9.2.5 To see that fn is integrable use step functions with partition points
at the xi's. The limit function is zero on the rationals and one on the irrationals. By
density of rationals any lower step functions has sum ≤0. Similarly, any upper step
function has sum ≥1.
Exercise 9.2.10. Let ε > 0 be given. By Exercise 5.4.7 g is uniformly continuous.
Hence there is a δ > 0 such that |(x,y) −(u,v)| < δ implies |g(x,y) −g(u,v)| <
ε/(d −c). If |x−x0| < δ, then |(x,y)−(x0,y)| = |x−x0| < δ.
Exercise 9.3.1 Similar to part of the proof of Theorem 9.2.11.
Exercise 9.3.2 Suppose f = 0 outside [a,b]. Then f is uniformly continuous on
[a −1,b + 1]. Hence there is a 0 < δ < 1 such that |x −y| < δ implies |f(x) −
f(y)| < ε for all x and y in [a −1,b + 1]. Since δ < 1, we get |x −y| < δ implies
|f(x)−f(y)| < ε for all x and y in R.
Exercise 9.3.3 If |f(x)| ≤M for x ∈[a,b], then |f(x)| ≤M for all x ∈R.
Exercise 9.3.6 One way is to mimic the proof of Theorem 9.2.11. Fix x0 we will
show f ∗g is differentiable at x0 with derivative f ′ ∗g(x0). Let φ(x,y) := f(x −
y)g(y), then φ and φx(t,y) = f ′(t −y)g(y) are continuous on R×R. Note that
f ∗g(t) =
ˆ x0+1−a
x0−1−b
f(t −y)g(y)dy =
ˆ x0+1−a
x0−1−b
φ(t,y)dy
for t ∈[x0 −1,x0 +1]. By the Mean Value Theorem
f(t −y)−f(x0 −y)
t −x0
= f ′(xt −y)
for some xt between t and x0. And so on.

Chapter 10
Series
We study inﬁnite sums (series) of numbers and of functions. Among the topics
are products of series, the Riemann rearrangement theorem, and the theory of
power series. As applications we construct a space ﬁlling curve, construct a con-
tinuous nowhere differentiable functions, and prove the Weierstrass Approximation
Theorem.
10.1 Series of Numbers
We begin by recalling some of Sect. 1.7 where we brieﬂy considered inﬁnite series.
The main aim in Sect. 1.7 was to establish convergence of the geometric series
∑∞
k=0 zk for |z| < 1.
Let x = (x j) be a sequence of complex numbers. We will assign a meaning to the
inﬁnite sum
∞
∑
k=1
xk = x1 +x2 +x3 +···
To do so we consider the (ﬁnite) partial sums sn of the ﬁrst n terms, that is
sn = sn [x] = sn [(xj)] :=
n
∑
k=1
xk = x1 +x2 +···+xn−1 +xn,n ∈N.
Each of these is a ﬁnite sum so we can, at least in principle, calculate each of them.
We say that ∑∞
k=1 xk is convergent, if the sequence (sn) is convergent to some
complex number. Otherwise we say that ∑∞
k=1 xk is divergent. When ∑∞
k=1 xk is con-
vergent, we will write
∞
∑
k=1
xk := lim
n→∞
n
∑
k=1
xk = lim
n→∞sn.
Hence, we can make use of our discussion of sequences to establish results about
series.

10 Series
If the xk are real numbers and sn →∞, we will write ∑∞
k=1 xk = ∞and we will say
that ∑∞
k=1 xk diverges to ∞. Similarly for divergence to −∞.
Exercise 10.1.1 (Linearity). If ∑∞
k=1 xk and ∑∞
k=1 yk are convergent and a and b are
complex numbers, then ∑∞
k=1(axk +byk) is convergent and
∞
∑
k=1
(axk +byk) = a
∞
∑
k=1
xk +b
∞
∑
k=1
yk.
Proposition 10.1.2. The convergence of an inﬁnite series does not depend on any
ﬁnite number of terms.
Proof. If yk = xk when k > n and m > n, then
sm [(xk)] =
m
∑
k=1
xk = c+
m
∑
k=1
yk = c+sm [(yk)]
where
c :=
n
∑
k=1
(xk −yk).
Hence, sm [(xk)] = c+sm [(yk)] for all m > n. Thus, sm [(xk)] is convergent as m →∞
iff sm [(yk)] is convergent as m →∞.

We considered geometric series in Sect. 1.7. Our results are summarized in:
Example 10.1.3 (Geometric Series). Consider the sum ∑∞
k=0 zk. In this case, sn =
1 + z + z2 + ··· + zn−1 and zsn = z + z2 + ··· + zn−1 + zn, hence, sn −zsn = 1 −zn.
Solving for sn gives
sn =
n−1
∑
k=0
zk = 1−zn
1−z .
It follows that ∑∞
k=0 zk is convergent and
∞
∑
k=0
zk =
1
1−z
when |z| < 1 and divergent when 1 ≤|z|. Furthermore, ∑∞
k=0 zk = ∞when z is real
and 1 ≤z.
Remark 10.1.4. Setting z = 2, the argument above shows the geometric series ∑∞
k=02k
is divergent. In fact, the partial sums grow without bound. Hence the series diverges
to inﬁnity. Is there a way to get a ﬁnite sum for this series? Yes! In fact, using the
2-adic metric, a distance function different from the absolute value, the sum ∑N
k=0 2k
converges to
1
1−2 = −1 as N →∞. This is possible, in part, because the 2-adic metric
is not related to the order on R.
In addition to considering notions of distance different from absolute values,
there are many other ways of assigning a ﬁnite sum to an ordinarily divergent series,

10.1 Series of Numbers
207
see Hardy (1949). Among such methods are summability methods. We will use the
Cesàro summability method in Chap. 12, as part of our discussion of convergence
of Fourier series.
Exercise 10.1.5. Some simple facts.
1. (Test for Divergence) If ∑∞
k=1 xk is convergent, then xn →0.
2. If ∑∞
k=1 xk is convergent, then ∑∞
k=N xk →0 as N →∞.
3. If each xk ≥0, then ∑∞
k=1 xk is convergent if and only if the sequence of partial
sums (sn) is bounded.
One of the "big" theorem in Sect. 9.1 is that a sequence of numbers is convergent
iff it is a Cauchy sequence. In the context of series, this result takes the form:
Proposition 10.1.6 (Cauchy Criterion). ∑∞
k=1 xk is convergent if and only if
∀ε > 0,∃N ∈N,∀m,n ∈N : m ≥n ≥N =⇒

m
∑
k=n
xk
 < ε.
(10.1)
Proof. Since sm −sn = ∑m
k=n+1 xk, when n < m, the sequence (sn) is Cauchy iff
(10.1) holds.

We will say that ∑∞
k=1 xk is absolutely convergent, if ∑∞
k=1 |xk| is convergent.
Exercise 10.1.7. If ∑∞
k=1 xk is absolutely convergent, then ∑∞
k=1 xk is convergent.
Convergence Tests
The following result is sometimes called the Comparison Test, using it is the most
important way to show that a series is convergent.
Theorem 10.1.8 (Dominated Convergence Theorem). If |xk| ≤yk for all k and
∑∞
k=1 yk is convergent, then ∑∞
k=1 xk is absolutely convergent.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Since ∑∞
k=1 yk is convergent, the Cauchy criterion gives us
an N, such that m ≥n ≥N implies ∑m
k=n yk < ε. Since |xk| ≤yk implies ∑m
k=n |xk| ≤
∑m
k=n yk, we conclude m ≥n ≥N implies ∑m
k=n |xk| < ε. So, by the Cauchy criterion,
∑∞
k=1 |xk| is convergent.

The ratio and root tests follow from the Dominated Convergence Theorem by
dominating by suitable geometric series.
Exercise 10.1.9 (Ratio Test). If there exists an r < 1 such that
 xn+1
xn
 ≤r for all
sufﬁciently large n, then ∑∞
k=1 xk is absolutely convergent.
Exercise 10.1.10 (Root Test). If there exists an r < 1 such that
n"
|xn| ≤r for all
sufﬁciently large n, then ∑∞
k=1 xk is absolutely convergent.

If (ak) is a sequence, then we can think of the partial sum An := ∑n
k=1 ak as the inte-
gral of (ak) and of the difference αn := an −an+1 as (the negative of) the derivative
of (ak) at n. If we do so, then the following is an analogues of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus.

sequence, if αk := ak −ak+1, then
m
∑
k=1
αk = a1 −am+1
for all m ≥1.
Proof. The left hand side is
(a1 −a2)+(a2 −a3)+···+(am −am+1).
So the result follows by cancellation.

We will also use the analogue of integration by parts:

The following is a general form of the alternating series test.
Theorem 10.1.18 (Dirichlet's Test). Suppose a1 ≥a2 ≥a3 ≥··· ≥0 and an →0.
If (bk) be a sequence of complex numbers such that the sequence of partial sums
Bn := ∑n
k=1 bk is bounded, then ∑∞
k=1 akbk is convergent.
Proof. Since (Bn) is bounded, there is an M such that |Bn| ≤M for all n. Let αk :=
ak −ak+1, then αk ≥0 and by the Fundamental Theorem of Discrete Calculus
m
∑
k=1
αk = a1 −am+1.
Hence, ∑∞
k=1 αk is convergent with sum a1. Now |αkBk| ≤Mαn, so the Dominated
Convergence Theorem, implies ∑∞
k=1 αkBk is absolutely convergent
By Summation by Parts,
n
∑

akbk =

∑

We will show that the right hand side is convergent at n →∞.
Since, an →0, we have |an+1Bn| ≤Man+1 →0. Consequently, ∑n
k=1 akbk →
∑∞
k=1 αkBk.

k is convergent and not absolutely convergent.
A series that is convergent and not absolutely convergent is called conditionally

Rearrangements⋆
The purpose of this section is to expose one of the beneﬁts of working with abso-
lutely convergent series. For simplicity we only consider series of real numbers.
If ∑∞
k=1 xk is an inﬁnite series, then ∑∞
k=1 yk is a rearrangement of ∑∞
k=1 xk, if there
is a one-to-one and onto function φ : N →N such that yn = xφ(n).
Theorem 10.1.22. If ∑∞
k=1 xk is absolutely convergent, then every rearrangement
∑∞
k=1 yk is also absolutely convergent and ∑∞
k=1 yk = ∑∞
k=1 xk.
Proof. Let s := ∑∞
k=1 xk. Let ε > 0 be given. Pick N, such that ∑∞
k=N |xk| < ε/2.
Pick M such that each x1,x2,...,xN is one of y1,y2, ...,yM. If n > M, then the terms
x1,x2,...,xN in ∑n
k=1 xk −∑n
k=1 yk cancel out, the surviving terms are ±xk with k >

Remark 10.1.23. It can be shown that if every rearrangement of ∑∞
k=1 xk is conver-
gent, then ∑∞
k=1 xk is absolutely convergent. However, we will not prove this result.

10.1 Series of Numbers
213
Note this does not assume the rearrangement converge to the same limit, that is part
of the conclusion.
Theorem 10.1.24 (Riemann Rearrangement Theorem). Let xn ∈R for all n. Sup-
pose ∑xn converges, but does not converge absolutely. Then ∑xn can be rearranged
to have any real number as its sum, to be divergent to ∞, and to be divergent to −∞.
Proof. Let
x+
n :=

xn
when 0 ≤xn
0
when xn < 0
be the positive part of xn and let
x−
n :=

0
when 0 ≤xn
xn
when xn < 0
be the negative part of xn. Then
xn = x+
n +x−
n and |xn| = x+
n −x−
n .
Suppose ∑x−
n is convergent. Then ∑x+
n = ∑(xn−x−
n ) shows that ∑x+
n is convergent,
and consequently, ∑|xn| = ∑(x+
n −x−
n ) is convergent, a contradiction. A similar
argument shows that ∑x+
n is not convergent. Hence,
∑x−
n = −∞and ∑x+
n = ∞.
Let a1,a2,... be the positive terms and let b1,b2,... be the negative terms. We saw
∑an = ∞and ∑bn = −∞. Let t be some real number. The desired rearrangement
∑yn is achieved as follows. Pick positive terms such that
a1 +a2 +···+aN1−1 < t and
a1 +a2 +···+aN1 > t
then pick negative terms such that
a1 +a2 +···+aN1−1 +b1 +···+bM1−1 > t and
a1 +a2 +···+aN1−1 +b1 +···+bM1 < t
then pick positive terms such that
a1 +···+aN1−1 +b1 +···+bM1−1 +aN1+1 +···+aN2−1 < t and
a1 +···+aN1−1 +b1 +···+bM1 +aN1+1 +···+aN2 > t
continuing in this way gives the desired rearrangement.

hence an →0 and bn →0. Consequently, aNj →0 and bMj →0.
Remark 10.1.25. To summarize: addition is commutative when working with abso-
lutely convergent series, but not when working with conditionally convergent series.

∑∞
k=1 (−1)k+1 1
k. Assume the positive terms in ∑∞
k=1 yk are in the same order as in
the original series and that the negative terms are in the same order as in the original
series. For example, ∑∞
k=1 yk could be
1+ 1

2 + 1
5 + 1
7 −1
4 + 1

10.2 Series of Functions
Let S be some set. Let fn : S →C for all n ∈N. Let gn(x) = ∑n
k=1 fk(x). We say that
∑∞
k=1 fk(x) is convergent, if (gn(x)) is convergent for all x ∈S, and we set
∞
∑
k=1
fk(x) := lim
n→∞
n
∑
k=1
fk(x).
We say that ∑∞
k=1 fk(x) is uniformly convergent on S, if (gn(x)) is uniformly conver-
gent on S.
The following is a version of the Dominated Convergence Theorem.
Theorem 10.2.1 (Weierstrass M-Test). Let S be some set and let fn : S →C be a
sequence of functions. Suppose there exists a sequence (Mn) of positive real numbers
such that
|fn(x)| ≤Mn, for all n ∈N and all x ∈S.
If ∑∞
n=1 Mn is convergent, then ∑∞
k=1 fk(x) is uniformly convergent on S.
Proof. Fix x ∈S. Since |fk (x)| ≤Mk and ∑Mk is convergent the series ∑∞
k=1 fk(x)
is convergent by Dominated Convergence. Hence, setting f(x) := ∑∞
k=1 fk(x) de-
termines a function f : S →C. To complete the proof we need to show gn(x) =
∑n
k=1 fk(x) converges uniformly to f on S.
Let ε > 0 be given. We must ﬁnd an N such that n ≥N =⇒| f(x)−gn(x)| < ε
for all x ∈S. Pick N such that ∑∞
k=N Mn < ε. For n ≥N we have
|f(x)−gn(x)| =

for any x in S.

Corollary 10.2.2. If each fn in the Weierstrass M-test is continuous, then the sum
f(x) = ∑∞
k=1 fk(x) is continuous.
Proof. The functions gn = ∑n
k=1 fk are continuous, since they are ﬁnite sums of
continuous functions. Using gn ⇒f and that uniform limits of continuous functions
are continuous completes the proof.

Example 10.2.3. We showed in Example 8.2.6 that ∑∞
k=0 xk/k! converges uniformly
to ex on any interval [−M,M].

10.3 Space Filling Curves⋆
A function f : [0,1] →[0,1]2 is called space ﬁlling if it is onto. A continuous func-
tion f : [0,1] →R2 is called a curve.
Theorem 10.3.1. Space ﬁlling curves exists.
To prove this theorem we will construct such a function. Curiously enough, this
will use a function C →[0,1]2 we considered in Exercise 3.6.2, here C denotes the
Cantor set. This curve was discovered by Isaac Jacob Schoenberg (21 April 1903,
Gala¸ti to 21 February 1990).
Example 10.3.2 (Schoenberg). Let
f(t) :=

⎨
⎪
⎩
0
if 0 ≤t ≤1/3
3t −1
if 1/3 ≤t ≤2/3
1
if 2/3 ≤t ≤1.
(10.5)
This determines a continuous function f deﬁned on [0,1]. Extend f to [−1,1] by
setting f(−t) := f(t) for 0 ≤t ≤1 and then to all of R, by periodicity, setting
f(t + 2k) = f(t), for −1 < t ≤1 and k ∈Z. Since f(−1) = f(1) we arrive at a
continuous function f : R →[0,1], see Fig. 10.2.

By the Weierstrass M−test with Mj := 2−j the functions x and y are continuous. Let

Consequently, on the Cantor set g equals the function from Exercise 3.6.2. In par-
ticular, g maps the Cantor set C onto the closed unit square [0,1]2 . In particular, g
is a continuous function mapping the interval [0,1] onto the square [0,1]2. Hence,
establishing (10.7) completes the proof.

A similar argument establishes (10.9). We have established (10.7), hence, we

Exercise 10.3.3. Show that (10.9) holds.
We saw in Sect. 4.2 that there are bijections f : [0,1] →[0,1]2. The following shows
that you cannot have everything. In particular, a space-ﬁlling curve cannot be one-
to-one. This is due to Eugen Otto Erwin Netto (30 June 1848, Halle to 13 May 1919,
Giessen).
Theorem 10.3.4 (Netto's Theorem). No function f : [0,1] →[0,1]2 is 1-1, onto,
and continuous.
This is Theorem 13.4.3.
10.4 Power Series
Given a sequence of constants an and a point z0 we can form a power series
∞
∑
n=0
an(z−z0)n = a0 +a1(z−z0)+a2(z−z0)2 +a3(z−z0)3 +··· ,
z0 is the point about which the power series is expanded. By deﬁnition (z−z0)0 = 1
so the ﬁrst term is the constant a0. We allow an, z, and z0 to be complex numbers.
For Taylor series we start with a function f and a point x0, set ak := f (k)(x0)
k!
and
then ask for which x the Taylor series
∞
∑
k=0
ak (x−x0)k
equals f(x). Example 8.2.6 illustrates this. When studying power series we start
with a sequence ak and a point z0 and then deﬁne a function f by setting f(z) :=
∑∞
k=0 ak (z−z0)k . We study properties of functions deﬁned in terms of power series,
these properties depend on the given data: the sequence an and the point z0. We begin
by studying the domain of such functions. We also study continuity, derivatives, and
integrals of these functions.

10.4 Power Series

Convergence
The most basic question is: given ak and z0 for which z does the series ∑∞
k=0 ak
(z−z0)k converge? Clearly ∑∞
k=0 ak (z−z0)k is a translate of ∑∞
k=0 akzk, so we will
consider the case z0 = 0.
It turns out that there is a R such that ∑∞
k=0 akzk is convergent for all z ∈C with
|z| < R and divergent for all z ∈C with |z| > R. The following formula for this
R was discovered by Cauchy and rediscovered by Jacques Salomon Hadamard (8
December 1865 Versailles, France to 17 October 1963 Paris, France).
Theorem 10.4.1 (Cauchy-Hadamard Formula). Given a power series ∑∞
k=0 akzk
let
R :=
1
limsupn→∞
n"
|an|
.
(10.12)
•
If |z| < R, then ∑∞
k=0 akzk is absolutely convergent.
•
If R < |z|, then ∑∞
k=0 akzk is divergent.
We use the interpretations 1
0 = ∞and 1
∞= 0.
Proof. The proof relies on two facts about the limit superior. Suppose limsupbk = L,
then (i) for any M > L the set {k | bk > M} is ﬁnite and (ii) there is a subsequence
bnk →L.
Let L := limsupn→∞
n"
|an| then R = 1/L. Let z be some complex number. We
must show that, if |z| < R then ∑∞
n=0 anzn is convergent, and if R < |z| then ∑∞
n=0 anzn
is not convergent.
Suppose |z| < R, in particular 0 < R, hence L < ∞. Pick S, such that |z| < S < R.
Then ∑∞
k=0 (|z|/S)k is a convergent geometric series and
1
S > 1
R = L.
So, by one of the characterizations of the limit superior, for all but a ﬁnite number
of k we have
|ak|1/k ≤1
S.
Multiplying by |z| and raising both sides to the kth power yields
akzk ≤
|z|
S
k
.
Since ∑∞
k=0 (|z|/S)k is convergent, Dominated Convergence shows ∑∞
n=0 anzn is ab-
solutely convergent.
Conversely, suppose R < |z|, in particular R ̸= ∞, hence 0 < L. Pick S, such that
R < S < |z|. Hence 1
S < L. Let ank be a subsequence such that
ank
1/nk →L as k →∞.

Since 1
s < L, for all but a ﬁnite number of k, we have
ank

n=0 anzn is not convergent.

Deﬁnition 10.4.2. The number R in Eq. (10.12) is called the radius of convergence
of the power series ∑∞
n=0 anzn.
Remark 10.4.3. If 0 < R < ∞, the power series ∑∞
k=0 akzk may converge at none,
some, or all points on the circle |z| = R.
Due to the usefulness of uniform convergence, we make the following observation.
Lemma 10.4.4. Let R be the radius of convergence of the power series ∑akxk. If
0 < S < R, then ∑akxk converges uniformly in the closed disk |x| ≤S.
Proof. By the Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem ∑akSk is absolutely convergent. For x
in the disk |x| ≤S,
akxk ≤
akSk, hence the result follows from the Weierstrass
M−test with Mk :=
akSk.

Calculus
The following lemma is useful in establishing some of the results below.
Lemma 10.4.5. If M > 0, then M1/n →1 as n →∞.
Proof. Suppose M > 1, then M1/n > 1 for all n. Let ε > 0. By Bernoulli's inequality
(1+ε)n ≥1+nε, for any n ∈N. Hence,
1+ε ≥(1+nε)1/n , for any n ∈N.
Pick N ∈N with 1+Nε ≥M. Let n ≥N. Then 1+nε ≥M and therefore
0 < M1/n −1 ≤(1+nε)1/n −1 ≤(1+ε)−1 = ε.
Consequently, M1/n →1 as n →∞.
If M = 1, then M1/n = 1 for all n. If M < 1, then 1/M1/n = (1/M)1/n →1.

Remark 10.4.6. Alternative proofs of the lemma. (a) If |z| < 1, the series ∑∞
k=0 zk is
a convergent geometric series. When z = 1, the series ∑∞
k=0 zk is divergent. Hence
the power series ∑∞
k=0 zk has radius of convergence R = 1. Consequently, so does
∑∞
k=0 Mzk = M ∑∞
k=0 zk. By Cauchy-Hadamard limsupM1/k = 1. Since the sequence

M1/k
is monotone, M1/k →1. (b) Using exponential functions and logarithms:
M1/n = exp

10.5 The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem⋆
In this section, we will reproduce Weierstrass' original proof of the Weierstrass
Approximation Theorem. Weierstrass proved this theorem when he was 70 years
old. There are several other proofs of this important theorem.
The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem states that given any continuous func-
tion f deﬁned on a compact interval [a,b], there is a sequence of polynomials pn
such that pn ⇒f on [a,b].
Theorem 10.5.1 (Weierstrass Approximation Theorem). Let f : [a,b] →C be
continuous and let ε > 0. There exists a polynomial p such that
|f(t)−p(t)| < ε, for all t ∈[a,b].
Picking a pn for each ε = 1/n yields:
Corollary 10.5.2. If f is continuous on [a,b], then there is a sequence of polynomi-
als pn, such that pn converges uniformly to f on [a,b].
The rest of this section contains the proof of the Weierstrass Approximation Theo-
rem. Apart from some preparatory work, that was well known at the time Weierstrass
proved this result, the proof is about one page long.
Convolution by a Polynomial
Below, we will need that convolution of a function and a polynomial is a polynomial.
Lemma 10.5.3. Let f be a continuous function on R that equals zero outside some
bounded interval and let p be a polynomial, then f ∗p is a polynomial.

Proof. Suppose p(x) = ∑n
k=0 akxk has degree n. Since ak (x−y)k = ∑k
j=0 βk, j(y)x j,
where each βk, j(y) is a polynomial of degree k −j ≤k (explicit expressions for the
β j(y) can be read off from the binomial theorem, but are not needed here), then
p(x−y) =

But we do not need this explicit formula in the proof above.

and in the proof of Lemma 1.4.12.
An Approximate Identity
We use the function e−x2/2 to construct an approximate identity.
Lemma 10.5.5. The improper integral
´ ∞
−∞exp(−x2/2)dx is convergent.
Proof. Since (−x)2 = x2 conclude

that the improper integral

Since x2 ≥x when x ≥1 we have
´ N

´ N
1 exp(−x/2)dx. By the
FTC-Evaluation we have
´ N
1 exp(−x/2)dx = 2e−1/2 −2e−N/2 →2e−1/2 as N →∞.

Let A :=

−∞exp(−x2/2)dx. Then A is some strictly positive real number. It can
be shown that A =

2π, but the value of A is not of importance to us.
Let E(x) = A−1 exp(−x2/2), for x ∈R. Then E(x) > 0 for all x since A > 0 and
exp(t) > 0 for all t. Also, we choose A such that

using the change of variables u = nx. (3) It remains to check that gn concentrated

Proof of the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem
Having taken care of the preliminaries, we are now ready to give the proof of the
Weierstrass Approximation Theorem.
Let ε > 0 be given.
Let F(x) := f(x)−

f(a)+ f(b)−f(a)
b−a
(x−a)

for x ∈[a,b]. Then F(a) = F(b) =
0. So setting F(x) = 0 for x ∈R \ [a,b] makes F a continuous function on R. F is
uniformly continuous (Exercise 9.3.2) and bounded (Exercise 9.3.3) on R.
We will ﬁnd a polynomial Q such that |F(x)−Q(x)| < ε on [a,b]. Setting p(x) :=
Q(x)+ f(a)+ f(b)−f(a)
b−a
(x−a) then completes the proof.
Remark 10.5.7. The idea is: (i) Fix a large n so F ⋆gn is uniformly close to F, this
is possible due to the Approximate Identity Lemma. (ii) Find a Taylor polynomial
q that is uniformly close to gn, this is possible by Example 8.2.6. (iii) Verify F ⋆
q is uniformly close to F ⋆gn. (iv) Since q is a polynomial, Q := F ⋆q is also a
polynomial. Apart from "book keeping" all of the work is in (iii) and the lemmas
above.
Let ε > 0 be given. Since (gn) is an approximate identity (Lemma 10.5.6), it follows
from the Approximate Identity Lemma that we can pick n0 so large that
F ∗gn0(x)−F(x)
 < ε
2 for all x ∈R.
(10.13)
Let R > 0 be an integer, such that −R ≤a < b ≤R. Let M > 0 be a real number
such that |F(t)| ≤M for all t ∈R.
Recall, from Sect. 10.2 that for any S > 0 the polynomials pn(x) := ∑n
k=0

for all x ∈[−S,0]. Where we used that if x ∈[−S,0] and c is between x and 0, then

Trigonometric Functions and Applications
We investigate the sine and cosine functions, show the Weierstrass function is con-
tinuous and nowhere differentiable, construct the number π, establish that π is an
irrational number, and give a brief treatment of polar coordinates. We also discuss
arc length, in particular, we show and circumference of the unit circle is 2π. Finally,
we show the area of the unit circle equals π.
The basic transcendental functions are the logarithm log(x), the exponential
function ex, and the sine and cosine functions sin(x) and cos(x). We investigated
log(x) and ex in Chap. 8.
In the ﬁrst two sections our treatment is precise, but somewhat informal, with
many results and proofs stated in passing.
11.1 Exponential Function
We begin by using power series to extend the exponential function to a function of
a complex variable. For a complex number z ∈C, let
exp(z) :=
∞
∑
k=0
zk
k!,
(11.1)
where the conventions z0 = 1 and 0! = 1 tell us that the ﬁrst term is equal to 1 for
any z. When z is a real number the right-hand side is the power series for the usual
exponential function, hence (11.1) extends the usual exponential function from R to
C. We will sometimes write ez := exp(z) for z ∈C.
Exercise 11.1.1. The radius of convergence is R = ∞.
Since the radius of convergence is R = ∞, the series is uniformly convergent on any
bounded subset of C. Hence, the exponential function exp determined by (11.1) is a
continuous function mapping C →C.

|exp(iy)|2 = exp(iy)exp(iy) = exp(0) = 1.
So exp(iy) is a point on the unit circle a2 + b2 = 1 in the plane R2 = C. For y ∈R,
we deﬁne the sine and cosine functions as the real and imaginary parts of exp(iy) :
cos(y) := Reexp(iy) and
sin(y) := Imexp(iy),
for y ∈R. Thus, exp(iy) = cos(y) + isin(y). Since exp(i0) = 1 = 1 + i0 we have
cos(0) = 1 and sin(0) = 0.
Since |eiy| = 1 we have
cos2(y)+sin2(y) = 1,
in particular, −1 ≤cos(y) ≤1 and −1 ≤sin(y) ≤1. By taking the real and imaginary
parts of
ei(x+y) = eix eiy
we see that
cos(x+y) = cos(x)cos(y)−sin(x)sin(y)
sin(x+y) = cos(x)sin(y)+sin(x)cos(y).

Setting x = y gives cos(2x) = cos2(x)−sin2(x) and sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x).
Exercise 11.2.1. Prove
cos(−y) = cos(y)
sin(−y) = −sin(y)
for all y ∈R.

Hence, cos′ = −sin and sin′ = cos. This can also be veriﬁed by differentiating
exp(iy) with respect to y :
exp′(iy) = iexp(iy)
by the chain rule, so
cos′(y)+isin′(y) = i(cos(y)+isin(y)).
We could use the power series to deﬁne cos and sin of a complex variable, but
we will not need these extensions of sine and cosine from R to C.
Construction of π
Consider only x ≥0. By the Mean Value Theorem sin(x)−sin(0) = cos(a)(x−0)
for some c between 0 and x, hence
−x ≤sin(x) ≤x

Given a point (x,y) with x,y ∈R. We will show there is exactly one θ such that

where r :=

Fix a point (x,y) ∈R2. Let r :=
"
x2 +y2, α := x
r , and β := y
r. Then (x,y) =
r(α,β). Hence, the following lemma completes the proof.
Lemma 11.2.14. There is exactly one number θ, with −π < θ ≤π such that
α = cos(θ) and β = sin(θ).
Proof. By construction α2 +β 2 = 1. If α = 1 then β = 0, so θ = 0 and if α = −1
then β = 0, so θ = π. Hence, we will consider −1 < α < 1.
Since cos′(θ) = −sin(θ) < 0 for 0 < θ < π, the function cos : [0,π] →[−1,1] is
a strictly decreasing continuous function mapping the interval [0,π] onto the interval
[−1,1]. Since −1 < α < 1, it follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem that
there is a θ, 0 < θ < π, such that cos(θ) = α. Using cos2 (θ) + sin2 (θ) = 1 and
α2 +β 2 = 1 it follows that
sin(θ) = ±β.
Hence, either sin(θ) = β or sin(−θ) = −sin(θ) = β. Using cos(−θ) = cos(θ) =
α, it follows that either (cos(θ),sin(θ)) = (α,β) or (cos(−θ),sin(−θ)) = (α,β).
This established the existence of θ. The uniqueness follows from cos : [0,π] →
[−1,1] being strictly decreasing, hence one-to-one.

Remark 11.2.15. Using z = x + iy, |z| =

11.3 Arc Length⋆
A curve is a continuous function φ : [a,b] →C. For example, if f : [a,b] →R is
a real valued continuous function, then φ (t) := (t, f (t)) determines a curve. The
length, called arc length, of the curve φ is
length(φ) := sup

,
where the supremum is over all partitions of the closed interval [a,b]. A curve
whose length is ﬁnite is called rectiﬁable. The sum, corresponds to approximat-
ing the curve by line segments connecting the partition points (see Fig. 11.1). The
following lemma shows that the sum gets larger when we reﬁne the partition, hence
taking the supremum in the deﬁnition of arc length makes sense.

11.4 Weierstrass' Nowhere Differentiable Function⋆
A continuous nowhere differentiable function was ﬁrst constructed by Bolzano.
Bolzano used a geometric construction utilizing a limit of piecewise linear func-
tions. Bolzano's construction is similar to a construction that is used to generate
fractal sets, sometimes called an Iterated Function System. The following is essen-
tially a reproduction of an argument given by Weierstrass in 1872 in a lecture to
the Royal Academy of Science in Berlin. Before Weierstrass publishes his example,
most mathematicians including Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (30 April 1777 Braun-
schweig to 23 February 1855 Göttingen) thought that a continuous function would
have a derivative at most points. We presented a different example in Sect. 10.3.
Theorem 11.4.1. Let 0 < b < 1 a real number and let a be a positive odd integer. If
ab > 1 and 2
3 >
π
ab−1, then
f(x) =
∞
∑
n=0
bn cos(anxπ)
is continuous on R and not differentiable at any point in R.

238
11 Trigonometric Functions and Applications
In what follows a and b will be ﬁxed. For example, a = 13 and b = 1/2 satis-
ﬁed the stated assumptions. The example in Sect. 10.3 was of the form f(x) =
∑∞
n=0 2−ng(9nx) where g is a continuous function of period two which is not differ-
entiable at all points. By contrast x →cos(xπ) is a continuous function of period
two which is differentiable at all points.
Since |bn cos(anxπ)| ≤bn and ∑n bn is a convergent geometric series, it follows
from the Weierstrass M-test that f is uniformly continuous on R. So only the non-
differentiability claim is interesting.
Remark 11.4.2. If fN(x) := ∑N
n=0 bn cos(anxπ), then fN converges uniformly to f as
N →∞. Each fN is C ∞, yet the limit function f does not have a derivative even at
one point.

Remark 11.4.3. One might think that continuous functions without derivatives are
exceptional. In fact, the opposite is true. The set of continuous functions on an in-
terval with a derivative at some point in that interval is a "vanishingly small" subset
of the set of all continuous functions on that interval. The author likes the Baire
category interpretation of "vanishingly small." Baire category is named after René-
Louis Baire (21 January 1874, Paris to 5 July 1932, Chambéry). Other mathemati-
cians prefer other interpretations.
11.5 The Number Pi is Irrational⋆
Irrationality of π was ﬁrst proven by Johann Heinrich Lambert (26 August 1728
Mülhausen, Elsaß to 25 September 1777 Berlin) in 1761. Lambert actually proved:
if x is rational, then tan(x) is irrational. So tan(π/4) = 1 implies π is irrational. Carl
Louis Ferdinand von Lindemann (12 April 1852 Hanover to 6 March 1939 Mu-
nich) proved in 1882 that ea is transcendental for every nonzero algebraic number
a. Setting in a = iπ in this result shows that π is transcendental.
Remark 11.5.1. It is not known whether or not any the numbers π ±e,πe, or π
e are
rational. On the other hand, e is a root of
x2 −(π +e)x+πe = 0.

11.5 The Number Pi is Irrational⋆
241
Hence, if π + e and πe both are rational, then e would be algebraic of order 2,
contradicting Theorem 8.3.3. Thus, at least one of π +e and πe is irrational.
Theorem 11.5.2 (Lambert). The number π is irrational.
Proof. Suppose π = a/b, where a and b are positive integers. Let
fn(x) := 1
n!xn(a−bx)n.
Then, fn(0) = fn(π) = 0 and fn(x) > 0 for 0 < x < π. Hence,
In :=
ˆ π
0
fn(x)sin(x)dx > 0.
Now,
0 < In ≤
ˆ π
0
πnan
n! dx = π (πa)n
n!
→0 as n →∞.
Hence, the proof is completed by showing that each In is an integer for all n ≥0.
Clearly,

Fourier Series
Our approach to Fourier series is based on some rudimentary facts about linear
spaces equipped with an inner product. Our approach to pointwise convergence is
based on Dini's criterion. We discuss uniform convergence and Cesàro summability
of Fourier series. We also show the Fourier series of a Riemann integrable function
convergences in the mean. We establish Weyl's criterion for uniform distribution
of sequences. As an application, we establish the uniform distribution in the unit
interval of the fractional parts of the integer multiples of an irrational number.
12.1 Introduction
Attempting to diagonalize the derivative f →−i f ′ acting on function is the interval
[0,1] leads to the Fourier series for f.
Diagonalization⋆
Recall from linear algebra that given a linear transformation L on Rd or Cd it is often
useful to ﬁnd an orthonormal basis ek, k = 1,2,...,d such that
Lek = λkek
for some scalars λk. The ek are called eigenvectors and the λk are the corresponding
eigenvalues. The matrix of the transformation L with respect to the basis ek, k =
1,2,...,d is a diagonal matrix with the λk's as the entries on the diagonal. We will
focus on the Cd case. For x,y in Cd the dot product or inner product is
x·y =

12 Fourier Series
where x = (x1,...,xd) and y = (y1,...,yd). The existence of an orthonormal basis
diagonalizing the transformation L is implied by
Lx·y = x·Lx
(12.1)
for all x,y in Cd. That the ek's form an orthonormal basis means that
ej ·ek =

if j ̸= k
and for any x ∈Cd there are scalars ak such that

For an orthonormal basis there is a formula for the scalars:
ak = x·ek.
That is
x =

(12.2)
for all x in Cd.
Let R denote the set of Riemann integrable functions f : [0,1] →C. Since the
product of two integrable functions is an integrable function, we can introduce an
inner product on R by setting
⟨f | g⟩= ⟨f | g⟩R = ⟨f | g⟩2 :=
ˆ 1

fg =

(12.3)
for f and g in R.
We study the diagonalization problem for
L := −i d
dx that is for L : f →−i f ′,
where f : [0,1] →C. The i is there to make the analogue of (12.1) possible. Speciﬁ-
cally, suppose L is deﬁned on the set D(L) of differentiable functions f on [0,1] for
which f ′ is integrable and f(0) = f(1). If f and g are in D(L), then integration by
parts shows

12.1 Introduction
249
since −i f(1)g(1)+i f(0)g(0) = 0. Hence, the analogue of (12.1) holds. The eigen-
vector equation L f = λ f is
−i f ′ = λ f
so f ′ = iλ f, thus f(x) = ceiλx. The boundary condition f(0) = f(1) means c =
ceiλ, hence λ = 2πk for some integer k. Setting c = 1, we arrive at the eigenfunc-
tions
ek(x) = ei2πkx,k ∈Z.
Note the eigenfunctions are orthonormal because

f = ∑
k∈Z
akek := lim
N→∞
N
∑
k=−N

for some scalars ak and if the scalars ak are determined by the formula
ak = ⟨f | ek⟩.
Note, the sum is inﬁnite, hence there are convergence questions that needs to be
investigated.
Fourier Series
The major contribution of Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (21 March 1768, Auxerre to
16 May 1830, Paris) to mathematics is now known as Fourier series. He also made
other major contributions to science, for example, he discovered the green house
effect.
Let ek (x) := ei2πx. If f is integrable on [0,1], then
3f(k) := ⟨f | ek⟩=
ˆ 1
0
fek =
ˆ 1
0
f(x)e−i2πkx dx
(12.5)
are the Fourier coefﬁcients of f. Since the integral is linear, f →3f is linear, in the
sense that if f and g are integrable and a and b are constants, then (af +bg)3(k) =
a 3f(k)+b3g(k) for all k.
The Nth partial sum of the Fourier series for f at x is

is the Fourier series associated with f. The limit in (12.7) can have several different
interpretations. Each interpretations leads to a different convergence question. We
investigate the following convergence questions:
•
Pointwise convergence, i.e., for which f does SN f(x) −→
N→∞f(x) for all x? See
Theorem 12.4.1 and Theorem 12.4.4.
•
Uniform convergence, i.e., for which f does SN f

f? See Theorem 12.4.5
and Theorem 12.5.5.
•
Convergence in the mean, i.e., convergence with respect to the norm

(12.8)
i.e., for which f does ∥f −SN f∥−→
N→∞0? See Theorem 12.7.3.
Convergence of (fn) to g in the sense that ∥g−fn∥→0 is called L2−convergence
or convergence in the mean.
12.2 Linear Algebra
The diagonalization problem belongs to linear algebra. This section develops the
linear algebra we will need.
Let A be a set and let V be a set of complex valued functions deﬁned on A. If
af +cg ∈V for all a,b ∈C and all f,g ∈V , then V is a vector space.
A complex valued map f,g ∈V →⟨f | g⟩∈C is an inner product on V , if for
all f,g, and h in V and all complex numbers a and b
⟨af +bg | h⟩= a⟨f | h⟩+b⟨g | h⟩
(12.9)
⟨f | g⟩= ⟨g | f⟩
(12.10)
⟨f | f⟩≥0
(12.11)
⟨f | f⟩= 0 =⇒f = 0
(12.12)
Equation (12.9) states the map f ∈V →⟨f | g⟩∈C is linear for each ﬁxed g ∈V .
Lemma 12.2.1. If f,g, and h are in V and a is a complex number, then
⟨f | g+h⟩= ⟨f | g⟩+⟨f | h⟩
⟨f | ag⟩= a⟨f | g⟩.

12.2 Linear Algebra
251
Thus, for ﬁxed f, the map g ∈V →⟨f | g⟩∈C is conjugate linear.
Proof. The calculations
⟨f | g+h⟩= ⟨g+h | f⟩= ⟨g | f⟩+⟨h | f⟩= ⟨f | g⟩+⟨f | h⟩and
⟨f | ag⟩= ⟨ag | f⟩= a⟨g | f⟩= a⟨f | g⟩
based on (12.9) and (12.10), constitutes the proof.

Riemann Integrable Functions
Comparing to (12.5) it is natural to consider
⟨f | g⟩= ⟨f | g⟩R :=
ˆ 1
0
fg
(12.13)
on the vector space R of Riemann integrable functions. Since the product of two in-
tegrable functions is an integrable function, the integral makes sense. The properties
(12.9-12.11) are simple consequences of properties of the integral. For continuous
f we have (12.12), hence (12.13) determines an inner product on the set of contin-
uous functions. There are positive nonzero integrable functions with integral zero,
hence (12.12) does not hold. Thus ⟨· | ·⟩is an inner product on R, except (12.12)
does not hold. The following is an adequate substitute for our purposes.
Exercise 12.2.2. Suppose f and g are integrable. If ∥f∥= 0, then ⟨f | g⟩= 0. Where
∥f∥:=
"
⟨f | f⟩.
For simplicity, we refer to ⟨· | ·⟩determined by (12.13) as an inner product also
on R.
Remark 12.2.3. If ∥f −g∥= 0, then
3f(k)−3g(k) =
ˆ 1
0
(f (x)−g(x))e−i2πkxdx = ⟨f −g,ek⟩= 0,
the last equality is Exercise 12.2.2. Hence SN f = SNg for all N. Consequently,
Fourier series cannot distinguish between f and g.
Remark 12.2.4. One can eliminate nonzero functions with norm zero by considering
the equivalence classes
[f] := {g | ∥f −g∥= 0}
of functions instead of working with the functions themselves.

252
12 Fourier Series
The Vector Space of Square Summable Sequences
For any integrable f, the Fourier coefﬁcients 3f (k), k ∈Z form a sequence. To
investigate these sequences we need an inner product on an appropriate vector space
of sequences.
Remark 12.2.5. Equation (12.10) holds for the inner product on Cd. In that case of
Cd it is customary to set e1 = (1,0,0,...,0), e2 = (0,1,0,0,...,0), ··· , and ed =
(0,0,...,0,1).
We extend Remark 12.2.5 to d = ∞. In this extension we replace Cd by the set ℓ2 of
all sequences xk ∈C, k ∈Z, such that
∞
∑
k=−∞
|xk|2 := lim
N→∞
N
∑
k=−N
|xk|2 < ∞.
In particular, ∑∞
k=−∞x2
k is absolutely convergent and consequently convergent.
Sequences in ℓ2 are called square summable.
Example 12.2.6. The sequence (xk) determined by x0 = 0, and xk = 1/|k|, if k ̸= 0,
is in ℓ2, but ∑∞
k=−∞xk is divergent. The sequence (yk) determined by y0 = 0, and
yk = 1/
"
|k|, if k ̸= 0, is not in ℓ2.
Lemma 12.2.7. If (xk) and (yk) are in ℓ2, then ∑∞
k=−∞xkyk is convergent.
Proof. Let ck := max{|xk|,|yk|}. Then
|xkyk| ≤c2
k ≤|xk|2 +|yk|2 ,
for all k. Consequently, ∑∞
k=−∞xkyk is absolutely convergent by dominated
convergence.

Analogous to (12.3) we deﬁne
⟨(xk) | (yk)⟩⟩= ⟨(xk) | (yk)⟩⟩ℓ2 :=
∞
∑
k=−∞
xkyk.
(12.14)
We will show this deﬁnes an inner product on ℓ2. To verify the ﬁrst property in
(12.9) we need to know that ℓ2 is a vector space:
Lemma 12.2.8. If (xk) and (yk) are in ℓ2, then (xk) + (yk) := (xk +yk) is in ℓ2.
Hence, ℓ2 is a vector space.

12.2 Linear Algebra
253
Proof. As in the proof of the previous lemma let ck := max{|xk|,|yk|} be in ℓ2.
Using a+a ≤2|a| and the deﬁnition of ckwe have
|xk +yk|2 = (xk +yk)(xk +yk)
= xkxk +xkyk +xkyk +ykyk
≤|xk|2 +2|xk||yk|+|yk|2
≤|xk|2 +2c2
k +|yk|2 .
In the proof of the previous lemma we showed that (ck) is square summable. Hence,
summing the right-hand side gives a convergent series. Consequently, by dominated
convergence, summing the left-hand side also gives a convergent series. This yields
the desired conclusion.

It is now easy to see that (12.9-12.12) hold. Hence (12.14) determines an inner
product. Similar to (12.8) we set
∥(xk)∥= ∥(xk)∥ℓ2 := ⟨(xk) | (xk)⟩1/2
ℓ2 =

∞
∑
k=−∞
|xk|2
 1/2
for (xk) in ℓ2.
Analogously with the case of Cd, it is customary to let ek ∈ℓ2 be the sequence
that consist entirely of zeros, except there is a one in the kth place.
Some Properties of Inner Products
Properties of interest to us are the Projection Theorem, the Pythagorean Theorem,
Bessel's Inequality, and the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma.
For the case of R = V and ek(x) = ei2πx, k ∈Z, we have
1
ej | ek
2
=

1
if j = k
0
if j ̸= k .
(12.15)
by (12.4). In the case of V = ℓ2 equation (12.15) is obvious for the standard ek
sequence k ∈Z, where the sequence ek consist entirely of zeros, except there is
a one in the kth place. When (12.15) holds for j,k in some set S, we say the set
{ek | k ∈S} is orthonormal.
The rest of this section is based on (12.15), on the properties (12.9-12.11) of the
inner product, and on the deﬁnition ∥f∥=
"
⟨f | f⟩. Hence, the following does not
depend on the way we deﬁned the inner product or on the expressions for the ek. In
particular, the results below are true both for the set of integrable functions R and
for the set ℓ2 of inﬁnite sequences.

254
12 Fourier Series
In the following we assume V is a vector space equipped with an inner product
f,g →⟨f | g⟩satisfying (12.9-12.11), that S is a subset of Z and there are vectors
ek, k ∈S such that (12.15) holds for all j,k ∈S. When (12.15) holds for all j,k ∈S
we say the set {ek | k ∈S} is orthonormal. Let ∥f∥:=
"
⟨f | f⟩for all f ∈V .
The basic result is an equality:

Everything above is true even if we only have a ﬁnite number of ek. The next

k ∈Z. The following inequality is named after Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (Born: 22
July 1784, Minden to 17 March 1846, Königsberg).

12 Fourier Series
Remark 12.2.13. Parseval's identity states that for Fourier series we have equality in
Bessel's inequality, this is Corollary 12.7.4.
Theorem 12.2.14 (Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma). If the set {ek | k ∈Z} is orthonor-
mal, then for any f ∈V , ⟨f | ek⟩→0 as |k| →∞.
Proof. Since the sum in Bessel's Inequality is convergent, the terms |⟨f | ek⟩|2 →0
as |k| →∞, by the Test For Divergence.

Henri Léon Lebesgue (28 June 1875, Beauvais to 26 July 1941, Paris) made
other contributions to the theory of Fourier series, however his major contribution to
mathematics was a new method of integration, now known as the Lebesgue integral.
This integral is an essential part of modern analysis.
Some Properties of the Norm
We use Bessel's inequality to establish the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality and the tri-
angle inequality for ∥·∥.
Theorem 12.2.15 (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality). For all f and g in V,
|⟨f | g⟩| ≤∥f∥∥g∥.
Proof. If ∥g∥= 0 both sides are zero. Suppose ∥g∦= 0, and let e0 := g/∥g∥. Then
Bessel's inequality (12.17) with m = n = 0 (and S = {0}) gives
|⟨f | e0⟩| ≤∥f∥.
Using e0 := g/∥g∥this is

Multiplying both sides by ∥g∥yields the desired inequality.

Theorem 12.2.16 (Triangle Inequality). For all f and g in V ,
∥f +g∥≤∥f∥+∥g∥.
Proof. This is a simple consequence of Cauchy-Schwarz.
∥f +g∥2 = ⟨f +g | f +g⟩
= ⟨f | f⟩+⟨f | g⟩+⟨g | f⟩+⟨g | g⟩
≤⟨f | f⟩+|⟨f | g⟩|+|⟨g | f⟩|+⟨g | g⟩
≤∥f∥2 +2∥f∥∥g∥+∥g∥2
= (∥f∥+∥g∥)2
Taking square roots completes the proof.

A map f ∈V →∥f∥∈R is a norm, if for all f and g in V and all complex

We established (12.19) above. Observe (12.18) follows from ⟨af | af⟩= aa
⟨f | f⟩. Setting a = 1, gives (12.20). And also shows (12.21) is equivalent to (12.12).

12.3 Partial Sums
We establish some properties of the Dirichlet kernel and use it to write the partial
sums SN f of the Fourier series of f as a convolution.
We now specialize to integrable functions. In this case the inner product is deter-
mined by
⟨f | g⟩=
ˆ 1

and the corresponding norm is
∥f∥=

|f (x)|2 dx.
Recall also the Fourier coefﬁcients are
3f (k) = ⟨f | ek⟩=

Before beginning our investigation of convergence of SN f we restate Bessel's In-
equality and the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma in terms of the Fourier coefﬁcients
3f (k).

 →0 as k →∞and as k →−∞.
The Dirichlet Kernel
In the remainder of this section we rewrite the sum SN f as a convolution of f and a
function DN called the Dirichlet kernel.
An integrable function f deﬁned on the interval [0,1] can be extended to a pe-
riodic function on all of R by setting f(x + n) = f(x) for all 0 ≤x < 1 and all
n ∈Z. The so extended function has period one. Note this may change the value of
f at x = 1, but it does not change any integrals we may want to calculate. For the re-
mainder of this chapter we will assume that f has period one, that is f(x+1) = f(x)
for all real x, unless otherwise stated.
Exercise 12.3.3. For any real number a we have
ˆ a+1

Since both f and ek have period one Exercise 12.3.3 implies

where we, interchanged the ﬁnite sum and the integral, used the change of variables

12 Fourier Series
We have written SN f as a convolution of f and DN. Unfortunately DN is not
positive, hence not an approximate identity. Consequently, we cannot apply the Ap-
proximate Identity Lemma. Nevertheless, the Dirichlet kernel is very useful when
investigating pointwise convergence of Fourier series. Hence, we establish some
properties of this kernel.
Exercise 12.3.4. Show that

DN(t) =

2N +1
if t = 0
sin(π(2N+1)t)
sin(πt)
if t ̸= 0 .
Usually we simply write
DN(t) = sin(π(2N +1)t)
sin(πt)
,
since the limit as t →0 equals 2N +1. Using DN (t) = DN (−t),
SN f (x) = f ⋆DN (x) =
ˆ 1/2
−1/2
f(x−t)DN(t)dt =
ˆ 1/2
−1/2
f(x+t)DN(t)dt,
where the last equality is an application of the change of variables u = −t.
12.4 Pointwise Convergence⋆
We establish Dini's criterion for pointwise convergence of a Fourier series. We use
Dini's criterion to establish Dirichlet's Theorem on the pointwise convergence of
Fourier series of piecewise smooth functions. We also show that if f has an inte-
grable derivative, then the Fourier series converges uniformly.
Recall, if ∥f −g∥= 0, then SN f = SNg for all N. For example, if
g(x) :=

f(x)
if x ̸= 1

f

dition on f.
The following is a version of a Theorem due to Ulisse Dini (14 November 1845,
Pisa to 28 October 1918, Pisa).

12.4 Pointwise Convergence⋆
261
Theorem 12.4.1 (Dini's Criterion).
Let f be integrable on the closed interval
[0,1]. Fix a point x0 in [0,1]. Deﬁne a function g on the closed interval [−1/2,1/2]
by setting
g(t) :=
 f(x0+t)−f(x0)
sin(πt)
it t ̸= 0
0
if t = 0
.
(12.23)
If g is integrable on [−1/2,1/2], then SN f(x0) →f(x0) as N →∞.
Proof. The ﬁrst equality below uses SN f = f ⋆DN and
´ 1/2
−1/2 DN = 1, the second
equality the deﬁnition of g and DN(t) = sin((2N +1)πt)/sin(πt), and the third uses

Exercise 12.4.2. Suppose f is integrable and g is determined by (12.23). If g is
bounded, then g is integrable.
Corollary 12.4.3. The Fourier series ∑∞
k=−∞3f(k)ei2πkx0 converges to f(x0) at any
point where f is differentiable.
Proof. If f ′(x0) exists, then


In the following result we do not assume that f(0) = f(1). It allows us to calcu-
late the sum of the Fourier series of certain discontinuous functions. The following
result is due to Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (13 February 1805, Düren to
5 May 1859, Gättingen).

12 Fourier Series
Theorem 12.4.4 (Dirichlet, 1829). Let f be deﬁned on the closed interval [0,1].
Suppose there is a partition
0 = x0 < x1 < ··· < xn = 1
such that f is differentiable on the open intervals ]xk−1,xk[, the limits
f(xk+) = lim
t↘xk
f(t) and f(xk−) = lim

all exists, with understandings similar to the ones above at the endpoints 0 and 1.
Then
SN f(x) →1
2 (f(x−)+ f(x+)) as N →∞
for all x in [0,1].
Proof. This is a consequence of the Dini Criterion (Corollary 12.4.3), if x ̸= xk.
When x = xk, the proof is similar to the proof of Dini's criterion.
SN f(x) =

g(t) =

sin(πt)
if 0 < t ≤1/2

Then g is bounded, by the proof of Corollary 12.4.3. Hence

DN = 1/2 and the convergence follows from the
Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma as in the proof of Dini's Theorem.

If we assume that the function in Dirichlet's Theorem is continuous we get
uniform convergence of the Fourier series. This is a consequence of the follow-
ing result. To prove this result we need the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for inﬁnite
sums.
Theorem 12.4.5. If f is continuous, f(0) = f(1), and f ′ exists except at a ﬁnite
number of points and is integrable, then SN f converges uniformly to f on [0,1].
Proof. By Bessel's inequality the series ∑∞

ˆ 1

f(x)e2πikx dx

the boundary terms in the integration by parts vanish, since f(0) = f(1). Hence

M-test, in particular, limSN f is continuous. . By Dini's Criterion (Corollary 12.4.3)
the limit is f(x) at the points x where f ′(x) exists. Hence limSN f and f are two
continuous functions that are equal except possibly at a ﬁnite number of point, thus
there are equal everywhere.

12.5 Cesàro Summability
Dirichlet proved a result, Theorem 12.4.4 is a version of this result, that implies
that if f has a bounded derivative, then SN f converges pointwise to f. He also
expressed the belief that, if f was integrable (and certainly, if f was continuous) then
SN f would converge pointwise. During the next 40+ years many mathematicians,

264
12 Fourier Series
including Riemann, Weierstrass, and Julius Wilhelm Richard Dedekind (6 October
1831, Braunschweig to 12 February 1916, Braunschweig), agreed with Dirichlet's
belief. It came as a surprise when a counter example was produced by Paul du Bois-
Reymond in 1873 or 1876.
Theorem 12.5.1 (du Bois-Reymond). There exists a continuous function whose
Fourier series diverges to inﬁnity at some point.
As a consequence of du Bois-Reymond example, there is a continuous f and a point
x0 such that SN f(x0) ̸→f(x0). In response to this example a new question arose:
Suppose f is continuous. Can we recover f from its Fourier coefﬁcients? Most
mathematicians thought the answer was no, but to everyones surprise Lipót Fejér
(or Leopold Fejér), (February 9, 1880, Pécs to October 15, 1959, Budapest), when
19 years old, showed that the answer is yes. In fact, he showed that
1
N +1
N
∑
n=0
Sn f →f uniformly
in particular, pointwise.
In this section we will assume that f : [0,1] →C is continuous and f(0) = f(1).
We extend f to a continuous function on R by setting f(x + n) = f(x) for all 0 ≤
x < 1 and all n ∈Z.
Fejér made use of a method for summing possibly divergent series due to Ernesto
Cesàro (12 March 1859, Naples to 12 September 1906, Torre Annunziata). The
Cesàro sums are
σN f(x) = (σN f)(x) :=

where
KN(t) :=

Dn(t)
is called the Fejér kernel.
We will show the Fejér kernel is an approximate identity. So we can use (the
proof of) the Approximate Identity Lemma to conclude σN f converges uniformly
to f.
To show that KN is an approximate identity we must verify (i) it has integral one,
(ii) is positive, and (iii) is concentrated near the origin. This is the next three results
(Fig. 12.2).

uniformly to f.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Sincef is continuous and periodic, f is uniformly con-
tinuous, hence there exists δ > 0 such that for all x we have |f(x−t)−f(x)| < ε/2,

12.6 Uniform Distribution of Sequences⋆
The connection between Fourier series and the uniform distribution of sequences
in intervals is used to establish Weyl's Criterion for uniform distribution. A direct
consequence of Weyl's Criterion is the uniform distribution of the fractional parts
of the integer multiples of an irrational number in the unit interval.

12.6 Uniform Distribution of Sequences⋆
267
Let (xk) be a sequence of real numbers in the compact interval [0,1]. We say (xk)
is uniformly distributed in [0,1], if for all 0 ≤a < b ≤1
lim
N→∞
#{k ∈N | k ≤N and a < xk < b}
N
= b−a.

Remark 12.6.1. Intuitively, uniform distribution means that the xk's are uniformly
scattered over the interval. This is not just a property of the set {xk | k ∈N}, the
ordering imposed by the subscript k is also important. For example, suppose (yk) is
uniformly distributed in [0,1]. Let ak := 1
2yk and let bk := 1
2 +ak. Set x1 := 1
2, x2 :=
a1, x3 := a2, x4 := b1, x5 := a3, x6 := a4, x7 := b2, x8 := a5,.... By construction,
lim
N→∞
#{k ∈N | k ≤N and 0 < xk < 1
2}
N
= 2
3.
Hence, (xk) is not uniformly distributed in [0,1]. On the other hand, if z1 := 1
2,
z2 := a1, z3 := b1, z4 := a2, z5 := b2, z6 := a3, z7 := b3, z8 := a4,..., then (zk) is
uniformly distributed in [0,1]. Of course, the sets {xk | k ∈N} and {zk | k ∈N} are
equal.
For a set A the function
1A(x) =

if x ∈A
0
if x /∈A
1A is called the characteristic function of A. We can write (12.24) as

The following are equivalent:
(i)
(12.27) holds for all f = 1]a,b[ with 0 ≤a < b ≤1.
(ii)
(12.27) holds for all step functions f on [0,1].
(iii)
(12.27) holds for all integrable functions f on [0,1].
(iv)
(12.27) holds for all continuous functions f on [0,1].
(v)
(12.27) holds for all continuous functions f on [0,1] with f (0) = f (1).
(vi)
(12.27) holds for all f = ek with k ∈Z. Recall, ek(x) = ei2πkx.
By considering the real and complex parts separately we see that if (12.27) is true
for real valued f it is true for complex valued f. In particular, (iii) holds for real
valued functions iff it holds for complex valued functions. Similarly, for (iv) and (v).
Proof. We will show (i) =⇒(ii) =⇒(iii) =⇒(iv) =⇒(v) =⇒(vi), (vi) =⇒
(v), and (v) =⇒(i).
(i) =⇒(ii). This is the nontrivial part of Exercise 12.6.3.
(ii) =⇒(iii). This is essentially the deﬁnition of the Riemann integral. As noted
above, it is sufﬁcient to consider real valued f. Suppose (xk) in [0,1] is uniformly
distributed in [0,1]. Let f be some real values continuous function on [0,1]. Fix
ε > 0. Pick lower and upper step functions s and S for f such that

Hence, the liminf equals the limsup so the limit exists and (12.27) holds.

(v) =⇒(i). Let 0 ≤a < b ≤1. Fix ε > 0. Let f and F be continuous functions

Remark 12.6.5. (iii) leads to the idea of Monte-Carlo integration.
The following criterion for uniform distribution was discovered by Hermann Klaus
Hugo Weyl (9 November 1885, Elmshorn to 8 December 1955, Zurich).
Theorem 12.6.6 (Weyl's Criterion). A sequence (xk) of points in the closed inter-
val [0,1] is uniformly distributed in [0,1] if and only if
lim
N→∞
1
N
N
∑
k=1
ei2π jxk = 0 for all integers j ̸= 0.
(12.28)
Proof. By (vi) in Theorem 12.6.4 the sequence (xk) is uniformly distributed in [0,1],
iff
lim
N→∞

N
N
∑
k=1
ei2π jxk =

for all integers j. Since

k=1 1 = ∑N
k=1 e0 (xk) and
´ 1
0 ek(x)dx =

to (12.28).

Recall, {t} := t −⌊t⌋denotes the fractional part of the real number t.
Corollary 12.6.7. If α is irrational, then the sequence of fractional parts ({kα}) is
uniformly distributed in [0,1].
Proof. Let n be a nonzero integer, since α is irrational, 2nα is not an integer. Hence

12.7 Norm Convergence⋆
Norm convergence of Fourier series is established. Consequences of norm con-
vergence are Parseval's Identity (equality in Bessel's inequality) and Plancherel's
Formula. These identities allow us to evaluate the sums of certain series by calcu-
lating integrals.
Norm convergence is not convergence in a simple pointwise sense, but in the
sense that the integrals
ˆ 1
0
|f (x)−(SN f)(x)|2 −→0
N→∞
(12.29)
for all integrable f. Using the norm (12.8), i.e., ∥f∥2 =
´ 1
0 |f|21/2
, we can write
(12.29) as
∥f −SN f∥2 −→0
N→∞.
We have mostly omitted the subscript in ∥·∥2 simple writing ∥·∥.
Remark 12.7.1. We have already establish some results that can be regarded as con-
vergence with respect to a different norm. For a bounded function f on [0,1] let
∥f∥∞:= sup{| f(x)| | x ∈[0,1]}.
It is easy to see that ∥af∥∞= |a|∥f∥∞and ∥f +g∥∞≤∥f∥∞+∥g∥∞. Hence, ∥·∥∞is
a norm on the set of bounded functions. Let fk, k ∈N, and f be bounded functions.
It is not difﬁcult to see that fk converges uniformly to f on [0,1] iff ∥f −fk∥∞→0 as
k →∞. Since a continuous function on is bounded, in particular, ∥·∥∞is a norm on
the set of continuous functions on [0,1]. In particular, Theorem 12.4.5 and Theorem
12.5.5 can be interpreted as stating that
∥f −SN f∥∞−→0
N→∞and ∥f −σN f∥∞−→0
N→∞
for certain classes of functions f. Since we have no further use for ∥·∥∞, we will
resume writing ∥·∥in place of ∥·∥2.
In this section we do not assume f(0) = f(1). As a ﬁrst step toward (12.29) we
establish a relationship between the partial sums SN f = ∑N
k=−N 3f (k)ek of the Fourier
series for f and f itself, we show if f and g are close, then so are the partial sums
of their Fourier series, more precisely:
Theorem 12.7.2. If f and g are integrable, then
∥SN f −SNg∥≤∥f −g∥.
Proof. Since
∥SN f∥2 = ⟨SN f | SN f⟩

Hence, the previous calculation gives
∥SN f −SNg∥= ∥SN(f −g)∥≤∥f −g∥
as we needed to show.

We use Theorem 12.7.2 to establish that, if f is integrable on [0,1], then
∥f −SN f∥→0 as N →∞. The proof is in three steps. (i) Use Fejér's Theorem
and the Projection Theorem to get convergence for continuous functions. (ii) A
given step function can be approximated by a continuous functions, hence Theo-
rem 12.7.2 and step (i) gives the result for step functions. (iii) Repeat step (ii), but
this time approximate a given integrable function by a step function.
Theorem 12.7.3. If f is integrable on [0,1], then
∥SN f −f∥=
ˆ 1
0
|f −SN f|2
1/2
→0
as N →∞.
Proof. Since SN f = (SN Re f)+(SN Im f) and
∥f −SN f∥= ∥Re f −(SN Re f)∥+∥Im f −(SN Im f)∥
we will assume f is real valued.
Step (i): Suppose h is continuous and h(0) = h(1). By Fejér's Theorem σNh
converges uniformly to h. The Projection Theorem, Theorem 12.2.10, states that

trarily small

∥h−SNh∥≤∥h−σNh∥.
But
∥h−σNh∥2 =
ˆ 1
0
|h−σNh|2 →0
because |h−σNh| converges uniformly to 0.
Step (ii): Suppose g is a step function on [0,1]. The idea is to approximate g by
a continuous h and then use Theorem 12.7.2 and Step (i). Let M satisfy |g(x)| ≤M
for all x. Let ε > 0. Construct a continuous function h by narrowing each step in g
slightly and connecting the ends to the x−axis. By similarly modifying the right end
of the last step we can arrange h(1) = h(0) = 0. See Fig. 12.4. Note that |h(x)| ≤
|g(x)| ≤M for all x. Hence, by making the sum of the lengths of the intervals where
we modify the step function less than ε2/4M2 we obtain
∥g−h∥2 =
ˆ 1
0
|g−h|2 =

|g−h||g−h|

ˆ 1

|g−h|


ε2/4M2
= ε2.
The last inequality used that |g−h| ≤2M and that the sum of the lengths of the
intervals where g ̸= h is less than ε2/4M2. Hence ∥g−h∥≤ε. Using Step (i) we
conclude ∥h −SNh∥≤ε for N sufﬁciently large. Since ∥g −h∥≤ε also ∥SNg −
SNh∥≤ε, by Theorem 12.7.2. So
∥g−SNg∥≤∥g−h∥+∥h−SNh∥+∥SNh−SNg∥
≤ε +ε +ε = 3ε

274
12 Fourier Series
for N sufﬁciently large. Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, this means ∥g−SNg∥→0 as N →∞.
Step (iii): Suppose f is integrable on [0,1]. This is similar to the previous part.
We approximate f by a step function g and use Theorem 12.7.2 and the second part
of this proof. Let M be such that |f(x)| ≤M for all x. Let g be an upper step function
for f such that
´ 1
0 g−
´ 1
0 f ≤ε2/2M. Then
∥g−f∥2 =

|g−f|2 =

ˆ 1

|g−f| = 2M
ˆ 1

≤2M(ε2/2M) = ε2.
Thus ∥f −g∥≤ε, by Theorem 12.7.2 also ∥SNg−SN f∥≤ε. By Step (ii) we have
∥g−SNg∥≤ε for N sufﬁciently large. Hence
∥f −SN f∥≤∥f −g∥+∥g−SNg∥+∥SNg−SN f∥
≤ε +ε +ε = 3ε
for N sufﬁciently large.

As a consequence of this theorem and the Pythagorean Theorem we have equal-
ity in Bessel's inequality, this is due to Marc-Antoine Parseval (27 April 1755,
Rosières-aux-Salines to 16 August 1836, Paris).

Chapter 13
Topology
This chapter contains a brief introduction to point set topology. The main aim is
to extend some of the important results about continuous functions on a compact
intervals to continuous functions on a larger class of sets, the compact sets.
Let K := R or K = C = R2. In either case
|xy| = |x||y| for all x,y ∈K
and the triangle inequality
|a+b| ≤|a|+|b| for all a,b ∈K
holds. That is | · | is a norm on K. By the triangle inequality |(x −y) + (y −z)| ≤
|x−y|+|y−z|, equivalently,
|x−z| ≤|x−y|+|y−z| for all x,y,z ∈K.
13.1 Open Sets
A subset D of K is open, if any point in D is the center of a ball contained in D,
that is
∀x ∈D,∃r > 0,Br(x) ⊆D.
(13.1)
Recall, Br(x) = {y ∈K | |y −x| < r} and if K = R, then Br(x) =]x −r,x + r[ is an
open interval. The use of the term "open" is consistent with our previous use of this
terminology in the sense that:
Example 13.1.1. An open ball is an open set.
Proof. (This is Exercise E.2.2.) An open ball is a set of the form D := Bs(y) for some
s > 0 and some y ∈K. Let x ∈Bs(y), then |x−y) < r, hence r := s−|x−y| > 0. We

will show Br(x) ⊆Bs(y). Let z ∈Br(x). Then
|z−y| ≤|z−x|+|x−y|
< r +|x−y|
= s
hence z ∈Bs(y). Thus Bs(y) is an open set.

Theorem 13.1.2. The empty set is an open set, the whole space K is an open set,
any union of open sets is an open set, and any ﬁnite intersection of open sets is an
open set.
Proof. The ﬁrst two claims are trivial. If Ai is a collection of open sets and x ∈
i Ai,
then for some i0 we have x ∈Ai0. Since Ai0 is open, there is a ball B with center x,
such that B ⊆Ai0. But then
B ⊆Ai0 ⊆
(
i
Ai,
hence 
i Ai is an open set.
Finally, if Ai, i = 1,2,...,n are open sets and x ∈n
i=1 Ai, then x ∈Ai for all
i = 1,2,...,n. Since each Ai is open, there are ri > 0, such that Bri(x) ⊆Ai. Let
r := min{r1,r2,...rn}, then r = rk0 ≤ri for some k0 and all i = 1,2,...,n. Hence
Br(x) =

Bri(x) ⊆

Consequently, Br(x) is the required ball.

Interior
The interior of A is

A := {x ∈A | ∃r > 0,Br(x) ⊆A}.
Clearly,

A ⊆A. The reverse inclusion is the deﬁnition of an open set.
Proposition 13.1.3. If A is open, then
◦
A = A.
Proof. If A is open and x ∈A, then Br(x) ⊆A for some r > 0, by the deﬁnition of
an open set. Hence x ∈

A.

Open Sets and Continuity
Example 13.1.6. The open interval ]a,b[ is an open subset of R. The open interval
]a,b[ is not an open subset of C, because the set ]a,b[×{0} = {(x,0) | a < x < b} is
not an open subset of R2.
Example 13.1.7. If U is an open subset of R, then U×]−1,1[ is open in R2. Conse-
quently, O := {x+iy | x ∈U,y ∈]−1,1[} is open in C and U = R∩O.
Deﬁnition 13.1.8. Let D be a subset of K. A subset A of D is open in D, if A = D∩O
for some open subset O of K, i.e., for some set O satisfying (13.1).
This deﬁnition makes the following theorem possible. Recall, f : D →C is continuous
at a ∈D, means
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0, f (D∩Bδ(x)) ⊆Bε(f(a)),
and that f is continuous on D, if f is continuous at each point a in D.
Theorem 13.1.9. Let D be a subset of K and let f : D →C. Then f is continuous on
D iff the pre-image f −1(U) is open in D, for any open subset U of C.
Proof. Suppose f is continuous on D. LetU be an open subset of C. Let a ∈f −1(U),
then f(a) is in U. Since U is open, there is a ε > 0, such that Bε( f(a)) ⊆U.
Since f is continuous there is a δ = δ(a) > 0, such that f (D∩Bδ(a)) ⊆Bε(f(a)).
Consequently, D ∩Bδ(a)(a) ⊆f −1 (Bε(f(a))) ⊆f −1 (U). Taking the union over
a ∈f −1(U) leads to, 
a∈f −1(U)

D∩Bδ(a)(a)

⊆f −1(U). The reverse inclusion fol-
lows from a ∈D∩Bδ(a)(a). Thus
f −1(U) =
(
a∈f −1(U)

D∩Bδ(a)(a)

= D∩
(
a∈f −1(U)
Bδ(a)(a).
Since 
a∈f −1(U) Bδ(a)(a) is a union of open sets, it is an open set. Thus f −1(U) is
open in D.
Conversely, suppose the pre-image of any open set in C is open in D. Let x ∈D.
We must show f is continuous at x. Let ε > 0. Then Bε( f(x)) is an open sub-
set of C, hence f −1 (Bε(f(x))) is open in D. Let V be an open set in K such that
f −1 (Bε( f(x))) = D ∩V. Since x ∈f −1 (Bε(f(x))) ⊆V and V is open, there is a
δ > 0, such that Bδ(x) ⊆V. Hence,
f (D∩Bδ(x)) ⊆f (D∩V) = f

f −1 (Bε( f(x)))

⊆Bε( f(x)).
Thus f is continuous at x.

13.2 Closed Sets
Recall, a ∈C is an accumulation point of D ⊆C, if
∀r > 0,∃x ∈D,0 < |x−a| < r
that is, if
∀r > 0,(D∩Br(a))\{a} ̸= /0.
Let D′ be the set of accumulation points of D. We say D is a closed set, if D contain
all its accumulation points, that is, if D′ ⊆D.
Example 13.2.1. Some simple examples of sets of accumulation points are :
1. If D = B1(0), then D′ = B1(0).
2. If D = N, then D′ = /0.
3. If D =
 1
n | n ∈N

, then D′ = {0}.
The following result establishes a correspondence between the open and the closed
subsets of K.
Theorem 13.2.2. D is closed iff C\D is open.
Proof. We must show D′ ⊆D iff C \ D is open. Suppose C \ D is open. Let a ∈
C\D. We must show a is not an accumulation point of D. Since C\D is open and
a ∈C\D there is an r > 0, such that Br(a) ⊆C\D. For such an r > 0, D∩Br(a) = /0.
Consequently, a is not an accumulation point of D.
Conversely, suppose D′ ⊆D. Let a ∈C\D. We must show Br(a) ⊆C\D for some
r > 0. Since D contain all its accumulation points, the point a is not an accumulation
point of D. Consequently, for some r > 0,
(D∩Br(a))\{a} = /0.
For such an r, D∩Br(a) = /0, since a /∈D. Thus Br(a) ⊆C\D.

Theorem 13.2.3. The whole space K is a closed set, the empty set /0 is a closed set,
any intersection of closed sets is a closed set, and any ﬁnite union of closed sets is a

Deﬁnition 13.2.4. A subset A of D is closed in D, if there is a closed subset K of K,
such that A = D∩K.
Exercise 13.2.5. Let A be a subset of D. Then A is closed in D iff D \ A is open in
D.
Exercise 13.2.6. Let f : D →C. Then f is continuous on D iff f −1(K) is closed in
D for any closed subset K of C.

13.3 Compact Sets
285
Closure
The closure of a set is the union of the set and its accumulation points. Hence if D
is a set, then the closure of D is the set D := D∪D′.
Exercise 13.2.7. The closure of an open ball Br(x) is the corresponding closed ball
Br(x). So the notation used for the closed ball agrees with the notation used for the
closure of the open ball.
Exercise 13.2.8. If K is closed, then K = K.
Let D be a subset of C. A point a is a contact point of D, if ∀r > 0,D∩Br(a) ̸= /0.
Exercise 13.2.9. Let D be a subset of C. The closure of D is the set of contact points
of D.
Theorem 13.2.10. The closure of a set is a closed set.
Proof. Let a be a contact point of D. We must show a ∈D, that is, we must show a
is a contact point of D. Let r > 0. Since r/2 > 0, and a is a contact point of D, there
is a b ∈D, such that |a−b| < r/2. Since r/2 > 0 and b is a contact point of D, there
is a c ∈D, such that |b−c| < r/2. Hence,
|a−c| ≤|a−b|+|b−c| < r.
Consequently, a is a contact point of D, as we needed to show.

Lemma 13.2.11. Let A be a closed set. The distance DA(x) from A to x is zero iff
x ∈A.
Proof. If x ∈A, then DA(x) = inf{|x −a| | a ∈A} ≤|x −x| = 0. Conversely, if
DA(x) = 0, then inf{|x−a| | a ∈A} = 0, so x is an contact point of A. Hence, x ∈A,
since A is closed.

Proposition 13.2.12. If A is a closed and [a,b] ∩A = /0, then there is a r > 0, such
that DA(x) ≥r for all x ∈[a,b].
Proof. By Example 5.4.4, the function DA : [a,b] →R is continuous. By the Extreme
Value Theorem it has a smallest value DA(xmin). By the lemma DA(x) > 0 for all
x ∈[a,b]. So r := DA(xmin) > 0, since xmin /∈A and A is closed.

13.3 Compact Sets
We established some useful results, for example, the Extreme Value Theorem, for
continuous functions deﬁned on compact (i.e, closed and bounded) intervals. In this
section, we extend these results to all closed and bounded subsets of K.

Covering Compactness
The notion of covering compactness is useful because it allows for simple proofs of
important properties of continuous functions.
Deﬁnition 13.3.1. Let F be a subset of K.
•
A collection of sets (Ab)b∈B , is a cover of F, if F ⊆
b∈B Ab.
•
A cover (Ab)b∈B is an open cover, if each Ab is an open set.
•
If (Ab)b∈B is a cover of F, C ⊆B, and (Ab)b∈C is a cover of F, then (Ab)b∈C , is a
subcover of (Ab)b∈B .
•
The subcover (Ab)b∈C is a ﬁnite subcover, if C is ﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 13.3.2. A subset K of C is covering compact, if any open cover of a K
has a ﬁnite subcover.
It is customary to say compact in place of covering compact. We say covering com-
pact to distinguish the covering deﬁnition from some of the alternative deﬁnitions
of compactness, see Corollary 13.3.21.
Example 13.3.3. R is not covering compact.
Proof. (]−n,n[)n∈N is an open cover of R. We will show this cover does not have
a ﬁnite subcover. If C ⊂N is ﬁnite, then C has a largest member max(C). Hence,

n∈C] −n,n[=] −max(C),max(C)[. In particular, max(C) /∈
n∈C] −n,n[, hence

n∈C]−n,n[ is not a cover of R. Consequently, R is not compact.

A subset K of C is bounded, if there is an M, such that |k| ≤M, for all k ∈K.
Exercise 13.3.4. If K is a covering compact subset of C, then K is bounded.

Proposition 13.3.7. A closed subset of a covering compact set is covering compact.
Proof. Let K be covering compact. Suppose F is a closed subset of K. Let (Uα)α∈A
be an open cover of F. Since F is closed, !U := R2 \F is open. Hence, the collection
!U, Uα, α ∈A is an open cover of K. Since K is covering compact, there is a ﬁnite set
B, such that !U, (Uα)α∈B is a subcover of K. The collection (Uα)α∈B is the sought
for ﬁnite subcover of F.

13.3 Compact Sets
287
Compact Sets and Continuity
Covering compactness is a topological property in the sense that any continuous
image of a covering compact set is covering compact. Since covering compact sets
are bounded the following is a generalization of Theorem 5.3.3.
Theorem 13.3.8. If K is covering compact and f : K →C is continuous, then f(K)
is covering compact.
Proof. Let (Uα)α∈A be an open cover of f(K). Since f is continuous each f −1(Uα)
is open. Hence,
K ⊆f −1 (f(K)) ⊆f −1

f −1(Uα)

(Uα)α∈B is a ﬁnite subcover of f (K). Thus f(K) is compact.

The following is a generalization of Theorem 5.3.5.
Corollary 13.3.9 (Extreme Value Theorem). If K is covering compact and f : K →
R is continuous, then there are xmin and xmax in K, such that
f(xmin) ≤f(x) ≤f(xmax) for all x ∈K.
Proof. By the theorem f(K) is a covering compact subset of R. Since any covering
compact set is closed and bounded, f(K) is a closed and bounded subset of R. Since
f(K) is bounded, inf(f(K)) and sup( f(K)) are real numbers. Since f(K) is closed,
inf( f(K)),sup( f(K)) are in f(K), consequently,
inf( f(K)) = f(xmin) and inf( f(K)) = f(xmax)
for some xmin,xmax ∈K.

The following is a generalization of Corollary 5.1.10.
Corollary 13.3.10. Suppose A,B are covering compact sets and f : A →B is a con-
tinuous bijection, then the inverse function f −1 : B →A is continuous.
Proof. Let F be a closed subset of A. We must show (f −1)−1 (F) is closed. But F is
compact, since F is a closed subset of a compact set. Hence, continuity of f implies
(f −1)−1 (F) = f(F) is compact, hence closed.

13 Topology
The following is a generalization of Theorem 5.4.6.
Theorem 13.3.11. If K is covering compact and f : K →C is continuous, then f is
uniformly continuous on K.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. Since f is continuous on K, and ε/2 > 0
∀x ∈K,∃δx > 0,∀y ∈K, f

Bδ(x)(x)

x∈K is an open cover of K. Since K is covering compact, there is

n
i=1 is a cover of K.
Let
δ := min
	δ(a1)
2

.
It remains to show that δ works. Suppose x,y ∈K and |x−y| < δ. Since the open
balls

Bδ(ai)/2(ai)
n
i=1 form a cover of K, there is an i, such that x ∈Bδ(ai)/2(ai). By
the triangle inequality
|y−ai| ≤|y−x|+|x−ai| < δ + δ(ai)
2
≤δ(ai).
Since both x and y are in Bδ(ai)(ai), we have
|f(x)−f(y)| ≤| f(x)−f(ai)|+|f(ai)−f(y)| < ε
2 + ε
2 = ε.
by Eq. (13.2). Thus f is uniformly continuous.

Heine-Borel Theorem
Since covering compactness allows us to prove important theorems as illustrated
above, we would like to have a simple description of this class of sets. Providing a
simple characterization of covering compact sets is the purpose of this subsection.
Lemma 13.3.12. A closed and bounded interval is covering compact.
Proof. Let (Uα)α∈A be some open cover of [a,b]. Let
S := {t ∈[a,b] | [a,t] has a ﬁnite subcover}.
Since a is in [a,b], a is in someUα, so a ∈S. Hence, S ̸= /0. Let c := sup(S). Since b is
an upper bound for S, c ≤b. Suppose c < b. Let Uα0 contain c. Let r > 0 be such that
Br(c) ⊆Uα0. Let (Uα)α∈D be a ﬁnite subcover of

a,c−r

. Then (Uα)α∈D∪{α0}
is a ﬁnite subcover of

a,c+ r

. Contradicting the deﬁnition of c. Consequently,
c = b. The argument also shows c ∈S. Hence, [a,b] has a ﬁnite subcover.

The same argument shows that [a,b]×{y} is covering compact.

13.3 Compact Sets
289
Lemma 13.3.13. Any closed rectangle [a,b]×[c,d] is covering compact.
Proof. To simplify the notation we will show [0,1]2 is covering compact. Let
(Uα)α∈A be some open cover of [0,1]2. Let
S := {t ∈[0,1] | [0,1]×[0,t] has a ﬁnite subcover}.
Then (Uα)α∈A is an open cover of [0,1] × {0}. By the previous lemma, there is a
ﬁnite subcover (Uα)α∈B of [0,1] × {0}. Hence, 0 ∈S, so S ̸= /0. Let c := sup(S).
Since 1 is an upper bound for S, c ≤1. Suppose c < 1. By the previous lemma,
there is a ﬁnite subcover (Uα)α∈C of [0,1]×{c}.
Let Φ := R2 \ 
α∈CUα. Recall, DΦ (y) := inf{|x−y| | x ∈Φ} is the distance
from the point y to the set Φ. The function f : [0,1] →R determined by f(t) :=
DΦ ((t,c)) is continuous, by Example 5.4.4. Hence, f has a minimal value r by the
Extreme Value Theorem. Since Φ is closed and Φ ∩([0,1]×{c}) = /0, the minimal
value satisﬁes r > 0. If x ∈Φ and y ∈[0,1] × {c}, then |x −y| ≥DΦ (y) ≥r. In
particular, [0,1]×]c−r,c+r[ ⊆
α∈CUα.

We can now establish a useful characterization of covering compactness named
after Félix Édouard Justin Émile Borel (7 January 1871, Saint-Affrique to 3 Febru-
ary 1956, Paris) and Heinrich Eduard Heine (16 March 1821, Berlin to 21 October
1881, Halle).

Theorem 13.3.14 (Heine-Borel). A subset of C is covering compact iff it is closed
and bounded.
Proof. We have already seen that, if K is covering compact, then K is closed and
bounded. So suppose K is closed and bounded. Since K is bounded, there is a square
[a,b]2 containing K. Since K is a closed subset of a covering compact set, K is
covering compact.

Sequential Compactness
A subset K of C is sequentially compact, if any sequence of points in K has a sub-
sequence converging to a point in K.
Example 13.3.15. The set of reals R is not sequentially compact. For example, the
sequence an := n does not have a convergent subsequence. In fact, since an →∞, so
does any subsequence.
Exercise 13.3.16. Any sequentially compact set is bounded.
Example 13.3.17. The set ]0,1] is not sequentially compact. For example, the se-
quence an := 1
n does not have a subsequence converging to a point in ]0,1], because
the sequence converges to 0, any subsequence converges to 0. And 0 /∈]0,1].
Exercise 13.3.18. Any sequentially compact set contains all its accumulation points,
hence is closed.
Exercise 13.3.19. Let (xn) be a sequence of points in A. If xn →x0, then x0 is in the
closure of A.
Recall, we proved in Sect. 9.1 that any bounded sequence of complex numbers has
a convergent subsequence. We called this sequential compactness, or the Bolzano-
Weierstrass Theorem.
Theorem 13.3.20 (Bolzano-Weierstrass). Let K be a subset of C. The set K is
sequentially compact iff it is closed and bounded.
Proof. We saw above that a sequentially compact set is closed and bounded. So
suppose K is closed and bounded. Let (xn,yn) be a sequence of points in K. Since
K is bounded, the sequence (xn,yn) is bounded. Hence, it has a convergent subse-
quence (xin,yin) by the result from Sect. 9.1 mentioned above. Let (x0,y0) be the
limit of this subsequence. Since K is closed, (x0,y0) is in K. Thus K is sequentially
compact.

Corollary 13.3.21. A subset of the complex plane is covering compact iff it is se-
quentially compact iff it is closed and bounded.
In particular, an interval is a compact set iff it is closed and bounded. This explains
the terminology "compact interval".

13.4 Connected Sets
We will discuss pathwise connected sets. This allows us to show a space ﬁlling
curve cannot be one-toone. We will not discuss the related, but different notion of
connectedness, of topologically connected sets (Fig. 13.2) .
A subset D ⊆C is pathwise connected, if given any two points a,b ∈D there is a
continuous function φ : [0,1] →D, such that φ(0) = a and φ(1) = b. The function
φ is a path in D connecting a and b.
Fig. 13.2 A region D and two points in the region connected by a path in the region
Exercise 13.4.1. Let D be a subset of R. The set D is pathwise connected iff D is
an interval.
Exercise 13.4.2. The square [0,1]2 is pathwise connected.
Theorem 13.4.3 (Netto's Theorem). No function f : [0,1] →[0,1]2 is 1-1, onto,
and continuous.
Proof. Suppose f : [0,1] →[0,1]2 is 1-1, onto and continuous. Since f is continuous
and [0,1] is compact, the inverse function g = f −1 is continuous. Let x0 = f(1/2).
Then g([0,1]2 \{x0}) is pathwise connected, since g is continuous and [0,1]2 \{x0}
is pathwise connected. But g([0,1]2 \{x0}) = [0,1/2)∪(1/2,1] is not pathwise con-
nected.

Solutions and Hints for the Exercises
Exercise 13.1.4. By Example 13.1.1 Br(x) is in the interior of the closed ball Br(x).
If |x−y| = r and s > 0, then Bs(y) is not a subset of Br(x).
Exercise 13.1.5. Let x ∈
◦
A. Pick r > 0 such that Br(x) ⊆A. Let y ∈Br(x). For
some s > 0, Bs(y) ⊆Br(x). Hence, y ∈
◦
A.
Exercise 13.2.5. If A is closed in D, then A = D∩K for some closed set K. Hence,
D\A = D\(D∩K) = D∩(C\K). The converse is similar.
Exercise 13.2.6. By Exercise 13.2.5 f −1(K) is closed in D iff C \ f −1(K) =
f −1(C\K) is open in D.
Exercise 13.2.7. If |x−y| = r then Bs(y)∩Br(x) ̸= /0. Hence, y is an accumulation
point of Br(x).
Exercise 13.2.8. If K is closed, then K′ ⊆K. Hence K ∪K′ = K.
Exercise 13.2.9. Let 3K be the set of contact points of K. Any point in K is a
contact point of K and any accumulation point of K is a contact point of K, hence
K ⊆3K. Conversely, if x /∈K is a contact point of K, then x is an accumulation point
of K. Consequently, 3K ⊆K.
Exercise 13.3.4. If K is not bounded, then (B1(k))k∈K is an open cover without a
ﬁnite subcover.
Exercise 13.3.6. If K is not closed, then K has an accumulation point a that is not
in K. Let A0 be the complement of the closed ball B1/2 (a) and let An = B1/n(a) for
n ∈N. Then (An)n∈N0 is an open cover of K without a ﬁnite subcover.
Exercise 13.3.16. Let x1 ∈K, x2 ∈K with |x2| > 1 + |x1|, x3 ∈K with |x3| >
1+|x2|, and so on. Then |xk| →∞. Hence (xk) is not convergent.
Exercise 13.3.18. Suppose K is sequentially compact and a is an accumulation
point of K. For each n, let xn ∈B1/n(a)∩(K \{a}). Then xn →a. Hence, any sub-
sequence of (xn) converges to a. Thus a ∈K.
Exercise 13.3.19. By deﬁnition of convergence, x0 is a contact point of A.

Logic and Set Theory
This chapter serves to introduce notation and notions from logic and set theory.
Many of the details are left as exercises for the reader. Hopefully, the reader is
already familiar with most of this material. We will use this material in the body of
the text, usually without calling attention to the details.
A.1 Logic
In the following P,Q,R are statements, that is, sentences that either are true or false.
A.1.1 The Connective "or"
P∨Q means at least one of P and Q is true. We say P or Q.
A.1.2 The Connective "and"
P∧Q means both P and Q are true. We say P and Q.
A.1.3 Implication
P =⇒Q means "if P is true, then Q is true" or "given P is true, we can conclude
Q is true". Often this is abbreviated "if P, then Q". We say P implies Q. Clearly, the
only way P =⇒Q can be false, is when P is true and Q is false.
Implication is the fundamental form of a mathematical claim.

A Logic and Set Theory
A.1.4 Bi-implication
P ⇐⇒Q means P =⇒Q and Q =⇒P. When P ⇐⇒Q we say P and Q are
equivalent and will sometimes write P if and only if Q, or more brieﬂy P iff Q.
A.1.5 Quantiﬁers
Most "interesting" statements depend on one or more variables, e.g., P(x),P(x,y),...
They may be true for some values of the variables and false for others, usually this
state of affairs is dealt with using quantiﬁers. There are two quantiﬁers, the universal
quantiﬁer ∀and the existential quantiﬁer ∃.
A.1.5.1 All
∀is shorthand for statements like "for all" and "for each".
∀x,P(x) means: for all x,P(x) is true
A.1.5.2 Some
∃is shorthand for statements like "there is", "for some", and "there exists".
∃x,P(x) means: P(x) is true for at least one x
A typical statement in this book is of the form: " f is continuous at x", which in the
notation introduced above is written as
∀ε > 0,∃δ > 0,∀y,|x−y| < δ =⇒| f(x)−f(y)| < ε.
A.1.6 Negation
¬P is shorthand for P is false. This may take the form of crossing out a binary
operator, for example, x ̸= y means ¬(x = y).
Some useful formulas involving negation are:
[¬(P∨Q)] ⇐⇒[(¬P)∧(¬Q)]
[¬(∀x,P(x))] ⇐⇒[∃x,¬P(x)]
[P =⇒Q] ⇐⇒[(¬Q) =⇒(¬P)]
[¬(P =⇒Q)] ⇐⇒[(¬P)∧Q]

A.2 Sets of Numbers
299
[P =⇒Q] ⇐⇒[P∨(¬Q)]
The third formula is the foundation for "proof by contraposition" and the fourth for
"proof by contradiction". In a proof by contraction we assume that P is false and Q is
true and then deduces some contradiction, i.e, we show [(¬P)∧Q] =⇒[R∧(¬R)],
where R is some statement. Since R is false, the only way [(¬P)∧Q] =⇒[R∧(¬R)]
can hold is if [(¬P)∧Q] is false, hence by the fourth formula P =⇒Q is true.
A.2 Sets of Numbers
The symbol "a := b" is used to indicate that b has already been constructed and that
we introduce the notation a to equal b.

A closed interval is a set of the form
[a,b] := {x ∈R | a ≤x ≤b},
[a,∞[ := {x ∈R | a ≤x} = {x ∈R | a ≤x < ∞},
]−∞,b] := {x ∈R | x ≤b} = {x ∈R | −∞< x ≤b}, or
]−∞,∞[ := {x ∈R | −∞< x < ∞} = R.
Where a ≤b are real numbers. Intervals of the form [a,b] are important enough to
have their own terminology, such an interval is called a compact interval. An open
interval is a set of the form
]a,b[ := {x ∈R | a < x < b},
]a,∞[ := {x ∈R | a < x} = {x ∈R | a < x < ∞},
]−∞,b[ := {x ∈R | x < b} = {x ∈R | −∞< x < b}, or
]−∞,∞[ := {x ∈R | −∞< x < ∞} = R.
Where a < b are real numbers. A half-open interval is a set of the form
]a,b] := {x ∈R | a < x ≤b} or
[a,b[ := {x ∈R | a ≤x < b}.

300
A Logic and Set Theory
Where a < b are real numbers. An interval is a subset of R that is either an open, a
closed, or a half-open interval.
A.3 Set Theory
A set is a collection of object, usually called elements. We will write x ∈A, if the
object x is in the set A. and x /∈A, if the object x is not in the set A. The set without
any elements is the empty set /0, mostly we do our best to ignore this set.
A.3.1 Subset
A ⊆B means x ∈A =⇒x ∈B, that is any element in A is an element of B. A = B
means A ⊆B and B ⊆A, that is A and B have the same elements. A ⊂B, means
A ⊆B and A ̸= B. Finally, A ⊇B means B ⊆A.
A.3.2 Union
A∪B is the union of A and B.
A∪B := {x | x ∈A∨x ∈B}
A.3.3 Intersection
A∩B is the intersection of A and B.
A∩B := {x | x ∈A∨x ∈B}
A.3.4 Set Difference
A\B is the difference of A and B.
A\B := {a ∈A | a /∈B}.
A\B is also called the complement of B in A.

A.4 Functions
The notation f : A →B means that f is a function deﬁned on the set A with values
in the set B, that is a unique element of B is assigned to each element of A by f. If
b is the element of B assigned to a ∈A we write f(a) = b, and we say that b is the
image of a under f.
A.4.1
If f : A →B, we say f is onto or surjective, if each element of B is assigned to some
element of A, that is
∀b ∈B,∃a ∈A, f(a) = b.
A.4.2
If f : A →B, we say f is one-to-one or 1 −1, or injective, if each element in B is
assigned to at most one element of A, that is
∀a1,a2 ∈A, f(a1) = f(a2) =⇒a1 = a2.

A Logic and Set Theory
A.4.3
If f : A →B, we say f is a one-to-one correspondence or bijective if f is both onto
and 1 −1. If f is bijective that any b ∈B is assigned to exactly one a ∈A by f,
given b the a that is assigned to b by f is denoted by f −1(b) := a, this determines a
function f −1 : B →A. f −1 is called the inverse function of f.
A.4.4 Set Functions
A.4.4.1 Image
If C ⊆A, then
f(C) := {f(c) | c ∈C}
is called the image of C under f. The range of f is f(A). If f(A) = B, then f is onto.
If f is one-to-one, we can consider the inverse function f −1 : f(A) →A.
A.4.4.2 Pre-image
If D ⊆B, then
f −1(D) := {a ∈A | f(a) ∈D}
is called the pre-image of D under f. Note, this does not require f −1 to be a function.
If for each b ∈B, the set f −1({b}) contains at most one element, then f is one-to-
one.
The use of the f −1 for inverse function and for pre-image are distinguished by
the argument in the ﬁrst case being an element and in the second case a subset.
The text assumes the reader knows the following results.

Appendix B
The Principle of Induction
We assume the reader is familiar with proofs by induction. As applications of induc-
tion we establish the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that there are inﬁnitely
many primes, and the Binomial Theorem.
B.1 Formulations of Induction
Induction is a fundamental property of the set of natural numbers. There are three
standard formulations. Let A ⊆N.
•
Weak induction: If (i) 1 ∈A and (ii) ∀n ∈N,n ∈A =⇒n+1 ∈A, then A = N.
•
Strong induction: If ∀n ∈N0,{1,2,...,n} ⊆A =⇒n+1 ∈A, then A = N. [If
n = 0, then [1,2,...,n} = /0.]
•
Well ordering: If A ̸= /0, then A has a smallest element.
It is well known that these formulations are in some sense equivalent.
The following provides examples of proofs by induction.
A number p ∈N is prime, if p > 1 and for all k,m ∈N, p = km =⇒k = 1 or
m = 1.
Theorem B.1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic). Any positive integer is a
product of primes. That is given any n ∈N there exists mj ∈N0, such that
n = pm1
1 pm2
2 pm3
3 ···
where p1 < p2 < ··· is the primes.
Proof. Suppose the claim is false. Let n be the smallest positive integer that is not
a product of primes. The product is = 1 if all mj = 0 and any prime is obtained by
setting one mj = 1 and all other mj = 0. So n is not 1 and n is not a prime. Hence,
n = n1n2, where n1 > 1 and n2 > 1. If both n1 and n2 are products of primes, then n
is a product of primes, so at least one of n1 and n2 is not a products of primes. Since,

B The Principle of Induction
n1 < n and n2 < n this contradicts that n is the smallest positive integer that is not a
product of primes.

Exercise B.1.2. The exponents mj are unique.
As an application of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic let me prove:
Theorem B.1.3. The are inﬁnitely many primes.
Proof. The number p = 2 is prime, so the set of primes is not empty. Let q1,q2,...,qn
be some ﬁnite list of primes. Let a := q1q2 ···qn be the product of the primes
q1,q2,...,qn. Let b := a + 1. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, b is a
product of primes. Let !p be one of these primes. Then b = !pm for some integer
m ≥1. Suppose !p = qk for some k ∈{1,2,...,n}. Then
1 = b−a = !p

m−a
qk

.
Since !p > 1 and m −a
qk is an integer, this is a contradiction. Hence !p ̸= qk for all
k = 1,2,...,n. Thus, no ﬁnite list contains all the primes.

This proof is essentially due to Euclid. Euclid worked in Alexandria during the
reign of Ptolemy I (323-283 BC).
B.2 Binomial Theorem
The factorial function is deﬁned inductively by the basis clause: 0! = 1 and the
inductive clause for n ∈N0 let (n+1)! = (n!)(n+1). Hence, n! = 1·2···(n−1)·n.
For n,k ∈N0 with n ≥k let
n
k

=
n!
k!(n−k)!.
These numbers are called the binomial coefﬁcients.

[Hint: This is a simple consequence of the inductive clause: (j + 1)! = ( j!)( j + 1)

N0 we have

The Field Axioms
C.1 Statement of the Axioms
A ﬁeld is a set F together with two functions a : F × F →Fand m : F × F →F,
usually called addition and multiplication and written as
x+y = a(x,y)
xy = x·y = m(x,y)
satisfying the following axioms:
Axioms for addition:
∀x,y,z ∈F,x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z
associativity
∀x,y ∈F,x+y = y+x
commutativity
∃0 ∈F,∀x ∈F,x+0 = x
existence of identity
∀x ∈F,∃−x ∈F,x+(−x) = 0
existence of inverse
Remark C.1.1. An ordered pair (F,+) consisting of a set F and a function (x,y) →
x+y mapping F×F →F satisfying the axioms for addition is called a commutative
group. Such a pair is also called an abelian group after Niels Henrik Abel (5 August
1802 Finnoy to 6 April 1829 Froland).
Axioms for multiplication:
∀x,y,z ∈F,x·(y·z) = (x·y)·z
associativity
∀x,y ∈F,x·y = y·x
commutativity
∃1 ∈F,∀x ∈F,x·1 = x

Axioms for the interaction of addition and multiplication:

nontriviality
∀x,y,z ∈F,x·(y+z) = (x·y)+(x·z)
distributivity
The set of rational numbers, the set of real numbers, and the set of complex num-
bers are examples of ﬁelds when equipped with the usual notions of addition and
multiplication. But there are other examples of ﬁelds. For example, if p is a prime,
then
Zp := {0,1,..., p−1}
equipped with addition and multiplication modulo p is a ﬁeld. We will not prove
this. For small values of p it can be veriﬁed by checking all cases. For p = 3,5 the
addition and multiplication tables for Zp are given in Tables C.1 and C.2.

C.2 Some Consequences of the Axioms
It is usual to deﬁne subtraction as x −y := x + (−y) and division as x
y := x

y−1
.
The point of the ﬁeld axioms is that arithmetic works in any ﬁeld. To verify this
requires some work. How one can do this is indicated below.
Theorem C.2.1 (Uniqueness of Identity). (a) If x + y = x and x + z = x for all x,
then y = z. (b) If x·y = x and x·z = x for all x, then y = z.
Proof. For (a):
z = z+y = y+z = y.

C.2 Some Consequences of the Axioms
311
Where we used x+y = x with x = z, commutativity of addition, and x+z = x with
x = y.
Case (b) is similar.

Theorem C.2.2 (Uniqueness of Inverse). (a) If x+y = 0 and x+z = 0, then y = z.
(b) If for some x ̸= 0, x·y = x and x·z = x, then y = z.
Proof. For (a):
y = 0+y = (x+z)+y = x+(z+y) = (z+y)+x = z+(y+x) = z+0 = z.
Case (b) is similar.

Theorem C.2.3. For all x we have x·0 = 0.
Proof. As for the previous theorems, this is a simple calculation:
x·0 = x·(0+0) = (x·0)+(x·0).
Adding −(x·0) to both sides and simplifying gives 0 = x·0.

Theorem C.2.4. The equality (−x)y = −(xy) holds for all x,y.
Proof. Again a simple calculation sufﬁces:
x·y+(−x)·y = (x+(−x))·y = 0·y = 0.
Since x·y has a unique additive inverse, the proof is complete.

Exercise C.2.5. Show −(x+y) = (−x)+(−y) for all x,y.
Exercise C.2.6. Show −0 = 0 and 1−1 = 1.
Exercise C.2.7. (a) For any x, −(−x) = x. (b) If x ̸= 0, then

x−1−1 = x.
Exercise C.2.8. If x·y = 0, then x = 0 or y = 0.
Corollary C.2.9. If x ̸= 0 and y ̸= 0, then x·y ̸= 0. In particular, (F\{0F},·) is an
abelian group.

C The Field Axioms
Below, we will write 0F for the additive identity in F and 1F for the multiplicative
identity in F to distinguish them from the natural numbers 0 and 1.
For x ∈F inductively deﬁne a map n →xn mapping N0 →F by setting by x0 = 1F
and xn+1 = xn ·x.
Exercise C.2.14. Prove that xm ·xn = xm+n for all m,n ∈N0.
Deﬁne a map n →nF mapping N0 →F inductively by
0 →0F
n+1 →nF +1F.
For example, 3F = 1F +1F +1F.

The collection of these polynomials is usually denoted by F[x].
Exercise C.2.16. Let p ∈F[x] and r ∈F. Show p(r) = 0F iff there is a q ∈F[x] such
that p(x) = (x−r)q(x). [Hint: See the proofs of Lemma 1.4.12 and Lemma 1.4.13.]
One cannot construct square roots using a ﬁnite number of arithmetic operations.
Hence, we cannot expect every member of a ﬁeld to have a square root. For exam-
ple,
√
2 is not rational, hence 2 does not have a square root in the ﬁeld of rational
numbers.
Example C.2.17. In Z3 the squares are 02 = 0, 12 = 1, and 22 = 1. Hence, both 1
and 2 = −1 are square roots of 1 and 2 does not have a square root.
In Z5 the squares are 02 = 0, 12 = 1, 22 = 4, 32 = 4, and 42 = 1. Hence, both
1 and 4 = −1 are square roots of 1, both 2 and 3 = −2 are square roots of 4, and
neither 2 nor 3 have a square root.
In Z7 the squares are 02 = 0, 12 = 1, 22 = 4, 32 = 2, 42 = 2, 52 = 4, and 62 = 1.
Hence, both 1 and 6 = −1 are square roots of 1, both 2 and 5 = −2 are square roots
of 4, both 3 and 4 = −3 are square roots of 2, and none of 3, 5, and 6 have a square
root.
Hence,
√
2 exists in Zp for some primes p and not for other primes p.

Appendix D
Working with Inequalities
The ﬁeld axioms allow us to manipulate equalities in the usual ways, for example, to
"complete the square". Some notable exceptions are, they do not allow us to extract
roots, or calculate values of the transcendental functions sin, cos, log, etc. We do
not use these operations/functions until we have established their existence. For our
development of roots see Sect. 3.5, for logarithms and exponentials see Chap.8, and
for trigonometric functions see Sect. 11.2.
Inequalities form the basis for most proofs in analysis. Thus, it is important to
know how to work correctly with inequalities. In this chapter, we will develop the
basic properties of inequalities based on two axioms: (i) trichotomy and (ii) positive
closure.
D.1 Inequalities
The universe in this section is a set satisfying the ﬁeld axioms. In particular, this
could be the set of all real numbers or the set of all rational numbers. We will also
assume that there is an order, that is a notion of positivity, on this set satisfying the
axioms of trichotomy and positive closure. Hence we are studying ordered ﬁelds.
Not all ﬁelds admit an order that turn them into an ordered ﬁeld. We will see below
that the complex numbers do not admit such an order and neither does the ﬁnite
ﬁelds Zp.
Axioms forInequality:
Trichotomy
For any a exactly one of 0 < a, 0 < −a, or 0 = a is true.
Positive Closure
If 0 < a and 0 < b, then 0 < a+b and 0 < ab.

D Working with Inequalities
Trichotomy provided a way to compare any number to zero. The following deﬁni-
tion extends this to a comparison between any two numbers.
Deﬁnition D.1.1. Given numbers a and b
1. a < b means 0 < b−a
2. a ≤b means a < b or a = b
3. b > a means a < b
4. b ≥a means a ≤b
Every property of inequality must be proven using the above axioms for inequality
and this deﬁnition.
Theorem D.1.2. a < 0 iff 0 < −a
Proof. If a < 0, then 0 < 0 −a. But 0 −a = −a, so 0 < −a. Conversely, suppose
0 < −a. Using −a = 0−a, this means 0 < 0−a. Hence a < 0.

Exercise D.1.3. Prove 0 < 1 and −1 < 0.
Let N := {1,2,3,...} be the set of natural numbers, N0 := {0,1,2,...} be the set
of natural numbers including zero, and let Z := {...,−1,0,1,...} be the set of all
integers.
Theorem D.1.4. If n ∈N, then 0 < n.
Proof. Since 2 = 1 + 1 and 0 < 1, then 0 < 2 by positive closure. Since 3 = 2 + 1
and 0 < 1 and 0 < 2, then 0 < 3 by positive closure. It follows by induction and
positive closure that for any n ∈N, 0 < n. In fact, suppose 0 < n. Since 0 < 1 and
0 < n, then 0 < n+1 by positive closure.

Exercise D.1.5 (Extended Trichotomy). For any a and b exactly one of
a < b,b < a, or a = b
is true.
Exercise D.1.6. a < b iff −b < −a.
Exercise D.1.7 (Transitivity). If a < b and b < c, then a < c.
It is customary to interpret a < b to mean that a is to the left of b, or equivalently, b
is to the right of a. Transitivity makes this reasonable, see Fig. D.1.
Fig. D.1 If a is to the left of b and b is to the left of c, then a is to the left of c
Deﬁnition D.1.8. a < b < c means that a < b and b < c.
So transitivity can be written as a < b < c =⇒a < c.

D.1 Inequalities
315
Inequalities Involving Addition
Exercise D.1.9. For any a,b, and c. If a < b, then a+c < b+c.
Exercise D.1.10. If a < b and c < d, then a+c < b+d.
Inequalities Involving Multiplication
Exercise D.1.11. If 0 < a and n ∈N, then 0 < an.
Exercise D.1.12. If a < b and 0 < c, then ac < bc.
A converse of Exercise D.1.12 is:
Exercise D.1.13. If a < b and ac < bc, then 0 < c.
Exercise D.1.14. If a ̸= 0, then a > 0 iff 1
a > 0.
Exercise D.1.15. For any a ̸= 0, 0 < a2.
Since the imaginary unit i, satisﬁes i2 = −1 < 0, this shows it is not possible to
deﬁne 0 < a on C, in such a way that both trichotomy and positive closure holds.
Exercise D.1.16. 0 < a < b ⇒a2 < b2.
Exercise D.1.17. a < b ⇏a2 < b2.
Exercise D.1.18. If 0 < a, 0 < b, and a2 < b2, then a < b.
The ﬁeld axioms do not imply the existence of square roots. In fact, the ﬁeld axioms
are satisﬁed by the set of all rational numbers, but some roots are not rational, see
Sect. 3.5. Hence statements involving, for example, a1/n, make the implicit assump-
tion that a1/n does exist.
If 0 < x, then √x denotes a number > 0, such that (√x)2 = x. Similarly, if n is
a positive integer, then a1/n denotes a number such that

a1/nn = a. If a > 0 we
assume a1/n > 0 and if n is odd and a < 0, then a1/n < 0.
Exercise D.1.19. If 0 < a < b, then √a <
√
b.
Exercise D.1.20. If n ∈N, and 0 < a < b, then an < bn.
Exercise D.1.21. If 0 < a < b, then a1/n < b1/n.
If n > 0 is an integer, then it follows from the Binomial Theorem and Exercise
D.1.10 that
(1+x)n = 1+nx+


x2 +···+xn ≥1+nx+0+0+···+0 = 1+nx
when x ≥0. This argument does not work when x < 0. However, when −1 < x, the
inequality can be established by induction:

316
D Working with Inequalities
Exercise D.1.22 (Bernoulli's Inequality). If n ∈N, then
1+nx ≤(1+x)n,
for all −1 < x.
Bernoulli's inequality is named after Jacob Bernoulli (6 January 1655 Basel to 16
August 1705 Basel).
D.2 Absolute Value
Consider a number system with a relation < satisfying the Axioms for Inequality.
Deﬁnition D.2.1. The absolute value |a| of a number a is determined by
|a| :=

a
if 0 ≤a
−a
if a < 0
Exercise D.2.2. Prove that −|a| ≤a ≤|a| for all a.
Exercise D.2.3. Prove that 0 ≤|a| for all a.
The following group of exercises explore how the absolute value interact with mul-
tiplication.
Exercise D.2.4. Prove that |a|2 = a2 for all a.
Exercise D.2.5. Prove that |−a| = |a| for all a.
Exercise D.2.6. Prove that |ab| = |a||b| for all a and b.
Exercise D.2.7. Prove that
 a
b
 = |a|
|b| for all a and b with b ̸= 0.
A very useful way to understand inequalities involving absolute value is:
Exercise D.2.8. For all a and b, prove that |a| ≤b ⇐⇒−b ≤a ≤b.
The two exercises below relate absolute value and addition.
Exercise D.2.9 (Triangle Inequality). Prove that |a+b| ≤|a|+|b| for all a and b.
There are no triangles in the set of real numbers, so the name "Triangle Inequality"
may seem strange. See Sect. E for the reason this inequality is called the triangle
inequality.
Exercise D.2.10 (Reverse Triangle Inequality). Prove that ||a|−|b|| ≤|a−b| for
all a and b.

Problems for Sect. D.1
1. If a < b, then there is a number c, such that a < c < b. [In other words, given
a number a, there is no number b, that is the "next" number.]
2. If a < 0 and 0 < b, then ab < 0.
3. If a < b and c < 0, then ac > bc.
Problems for Sect. D.2
1. If x,y are points in the closed interval [a,b], then |x−y| ≤b−a.
Solutions and Hints for the Exercises
Exercise D.1.3. If 0 < −1, then 0 < (−1)(−1) by positive closure. But 0 < −1
and 0 < 1 contradicts trichotomy.
Exercise D.1.5. Apply trichotomy to c := b−a.
Exercise D.1.6. You cannot multiply by −1, because we only know positive
closure.

Appendix E
Complex Numbers
The set of complex numbers C is the set of ordered pairs of real numbers
C := R2 = {(a,b) | a,b ∈R}.
Abbreviating a = (a,0) identiﬁes R with the subset R × {0} of C. In particular,
1 = (1,0). The imaginary unit is i := (0,1). With this notation we have
(a,b) = a(1,0)+b(0,1) = a+ib.
The ﬁrst equality being a standard property of R2. With this notation, in particular,
0 = 0+i0.
The real part of a complex number is Re(a+ib) := a and the imaginary part is
Im(a+ib) := b. Hence for a complex number z, z = Re(z)+iIm(z).
Arithmetic in C is determined by
(a1 +ib1)+(a2 +ib2) := (a1 +a2)+i(b1 +b2)
and
(a1 +ib1)(a2 +ib2) := (a1a2 −b1b2)+i(a1b2 +b1a2).
In particular,
i2 = i·i = (0,1)(0,1) = (0−1)+(0+0)i = −1.
Division of complex numbers is determined by
a1 +ib1
a2 +ib2
:= (a1 +ib1)(a2 −ib2)
(a2 +ib2)(a2 −ib2) = a1a2 +b1b2

when a2 +ib2 ̸= 0. If b1 = b2 = 0 this agrees with arithmetic in R.
Exercise E.0.1. If z = a+ib ̸= 0, then z/z = 1.

E Complex Numbers
E.1 Basic Properties of Complex Numbers
Manipulations with complex numbers is often most efﬁciently done without consid-
ering the real and imaginary parts.
Exercise E.1.1. If z,z1, and z2 are complex numbers, then
1. z1 +z2 = z2 +z1
2. z1z2 = z2z1
3. z(z1 +z2) = zz1 +zz2
The complex conjugate of a+ib is a+ib := a−ib.
Exercise E.1.2. If z and w are complex numbers, then
1. z+w = z+w
2. zw = zw
3. z = z
The length or modulus of a complex number a+ib is
|a+ib| :=
"
a2 +b2.
This agrees with the way one normally deﬁnes the length |(a,b)| =
√
a2 +b2 in
R2. Also, |a+i0| =
√
a2 is the absolute value of a. Hence, results proven about the
modulus of a complex number are also true for the absolute value of a real number.
Exercise E.1.3. Let z and w be complex numbers, then
1. zz = |z|2
2. |z| = |z|
3. |zw| = |z||w|
4. z
w = zw
|w|2 , if w ̸= 0
Proposition E.1.4. For any complex number z, |Re(z)| ≤|z| and |Im(z)| ≤|z|.
Proof. If z = a+ib, then |a| =
√
a2 +0 ≤
√
a2 +b2. Similarly, |b| ≤
√
a2 +b2.

Exercise E.1.5. Re(z+w) = Re(z)+Re(w) and Im(z+w) = Im(z)+Im(w) for any
complex numbers z and w.
Exercise E.1.6. z+z = 2Re(z) and z−z = i2Im(z) for any complex number z.
Using some of the properties listed above we now establish how the modulus interact
with addition.
Theorem E.1.7 (Triangle Inequality). The modulus | · | satisﬁes the triangle in-
equality
|z1 +z2| ≤|z1|+|z2|
for all z1 and z2 in C.

E.1 Basic Properties of Complex Numbers
321
Proof. Calculating we have
z1z2 +z1z2 = z1z2 +z1z2
= 2Re(z1z2).
Hence
|z1 +z2|2 = (z1 +z2)(z1 +z2)
= z1z1 +z2z2 +z1z2 +z1z2
= |z1|2 +|z2|2 +2Re(z1z2)
≤|z1|2 +|z2|2 +2|z1z2|
= |z1|2 +|z2|2 +2|z1||z2|
= (|z1|+|z2|)2
for any complex numbers z1 and z2. Taking the square root gives the desired in-
equality.

For any three points a,b,c in the complex plane
a−c = (a−b)+(b−c)
so the triangle inequality with z1 := a−b and z2 := b−c says
|a−c| ≤|a−b|+|b−c|.
The triangle inequality, written in this way, is the most important inequality in anal-
ysis. We will use it hundreds of times in this text. We will often use it when we want
to estimate |a −c|. The "trick" is to "guess" b so that we can estimate |a −b| and
|b−c|.
Geometrically it says that the length of any side of the triangle is ≤the sum
of the lengths of the other two sides. See Fig. E.1. This is the reason it is called
Fig. E.1 Triangle Inequality. Label the vertices a,b,c in any manner
the triangle inequality. Thinking of the triangle inequality this way may helps us
understand, pictorially, when we may need to us the triangle inequality.
Restating the triangle inequality using z1 = a1 +ia2 and z2 = b1 +ib2 gives

for all real numbers a1, a2, b1, and b2. This is the triangle inequality in R2, since
|(a,b)| =
√
a2 +b2 is the distance function, i.e., norm, in R2.
Exercise E.1.8. Show that the reverse triangle inequality
||z1|−|z2|| ≤|z1 −z2|
holds for z1,z2 in C.
E.2 Balls
The open ball with center c and radius r > 0 is the set of points whose distance from
c is smaller than r. A closed ball is deﬁned similarly, with the distance being at most
r. The sphere with center c and radius r is the set of points whose distance from c
equals r.
Balls in C
Let c ∈C and let r > 0. The set
Br(c) := {z ∈C | |z−c| < r}
is an open ball with center c and radius r. The set
Br(c) := {z ∈C | |z−c| ≤r}
is a closed ball with center c and radius r. The set
Sr (c) := {z ∈C | |z−c| = r}
is a sphere. Clearly, the sphere is the difference between the closed and the open
ball: Br(c)\Br(c) = Sr (c). Geometrically, balls in C are disks and spheres in C are
circles.
Balls in R
Let c ∈R and let r > 0. The set
Br(c) := {z ∈R | |z−c| < r}
is an open ball with center c and radius r. The set
Br(c) := {z ∈R | |z−c| ≤r}

E.2 Balls
323
is a closed ball with center c and radius r. The set
Sr (c) := {z ∈R | |z−c| = r}
is a sphere. Geometrically, balls in R are intervals and spheres are the endpoints of
intervals.
Exercise E.2.1. Suppose we are in R. If c ∈R, then Br(c) =]c−r,c+r[.

The next two problems investigate positive closure of this linear order on C.
6. Show that if 0 < a+ib and 0 < c+id, then 0 < (a+ib)+(c+id).
7. Give an example of numbers 0 < a + ib and 0 < c + id, such that (a+ib)
(c+id) < 0.
Solutions and Hints for the Exercises
Exercise E.1.8. Look at the corresponding result in Sect. D.2.
Exercise E.2.2. Drawing a picture, see Fig. E.2, shows that any 0 < s ≤r−|c−z0|
should work. Suppose z satisﬁes |z −z0| < s, then an application of the triangle
inequality shows that |z−c| < r.

Greek Alphabet
Some of the greek letters are written in more than one form. For the upper case
letters the variations are small. In some cases one of the forms looks like a symbol
used in another context, notably ∈and ε.

The author has taught, parts of, the material included in this text using several dif-
ferent textbooks. For example, he has taught from (various editions of) Bartle and
Sherbert (1999), Burn (2000), Belding (2008), Lay (2004), and Strichartz (2000).
The present text is clearly inﬂuenced by the works cited above. The list below con-
tains the cases where the author consciously adapted material from other sources to
ﬁt into this text.
•
Arranging the theory of inequalities as a sequence of inequalities is adapted from
Burn (2000).
•
A table similar to Table 1.1 can be found in Boester (2010), the use of the word
"tolerance" is also taken from Boester (2010).
•
The proof of Steinhaus' Three Distance Conjecture, Theorem 1.8.1, is from
Slater (1967).
•
The proof of Theorem 3.4.1 is from Dunham (1990), where it is credited to
Volterra.
•
The proof of Theorem 3.5.4 is a modiﬁcation of the proof in Ferreño (2009).
•
The notion "increasing at a point" is from Strichartz (2000).
•
The proof of Theorem 6.5.3 is adapted from Körner (1989), where it is credited
to Liouville.
•
The proof that e is transcendental is adapted from Gelfond (1960).
•
The problems for Sect. 8.3 showing that nonzero rational powers of e are irra-
tional are adapted from Aigner and Ziegler (2004).
•
The proof of Theorem 9.2.12 is an interpretation of (part of) Remark 2 in Aksoy
and Martelli (2002)
•
The proof of Theorem 9.4.1 is essentially from Scheinerman and Schep (2009).
•
The construction of the space ﬁlling curve in Sect. 10.3 is adapted from Sagan
(1994).
•
The proof of Theorem 10.5.1 is adapted from Körner (1989), who credits it to
Weierstrass.
•
The construction of π in Sect. 11.2 is adapted from Bartle and Sherbert (1999).

The proof in Sect. 11.4 is adapted from a paper Weierstrass presented to the
Königliche Akademie der Wissenschaften on 18 July 1872, Weierstrass (1895).
•
The proof of Theorem 11.5.2 is adapted from Zhou and Markov (2010).
•
The problems for Sect. 11.5 outline Niven's proof that π is irrational, see Niven
(1947).
•
Problem 2 for Sect. 13.4 is adapted from the proof of Darboux's Intermediate
Value Theorem in Nadler (2010).
