Let's  Study
•	
Directed angle.
•	
Angles of different measurements
•	
Units of measure of an angle
•	
Length of an arc of a circle.
•	
Area of a sector of a circle.
Let's Recall
•	
We know how to draw the acute angles
of different measures.
•
In a circle we can find arc length and area 
of a sector in terms of the central angle
and the radius.	
Activity No. 1	
Draw the angle ABC of measure 40° 
Fig. 1.1
Fig. 1.2	
In the Fig.s 1.1 and 1.2 both the angles are 
of 40°. But one is measured in anticlockwise 
direction and the other is measured in clockwise 
direction.
Now we will differentiate between such 
angles. 
Let's Learn
1.1	 Directed Angles:
	
Consider the 
ray 
OA. 
Rotate 
it about O till it 
takes the position 
OB as shown in 
Fig. 
1.3. 
Then 
angle so obtained 
due to the rotation 
is called directed 
angle AOB. We 
define the notion 
of directed angle as follows:
Definition:
	
The ordered pair of rays (OA,OB) together 
with the rotation of the ray OA to the position 
of the ray OB is called the directed angle 
∠AOB.
If the rotation of the initial ray is 
anticlockwise then the measure of directed 
angle is considered as positive and if it is 
clockwise then the measure of directed angle 
is considered as negative. In the ordered pair 
(OA,OB), the ray OA is called the initial arm 
and the ray OB is called the terminal arm. 
Fig. 1.3(a)
Fig. 1.3(b)
Fig. 1.3
Angle and its measurement
1

2
O is called the vertex as shown in fig 1.3(a) 
and 1.3(b).
	
Observe Fig 1.3(b) and note that
	
(OA,OB) ≠ (OB,OA)
	
∠ AOB ≠ ∠ BOA 
∠ AOB ≠ ∠ BOA even though they have 
same amount of rotation.
Zero angle:
If the ray OA has zero rotation, that is 
it does not rotate, the initial arm itself is a 
terminal arm OB, the angle so formed is zero 
angle.
Fig. 1.4
One rotation angle:
After one complete rotation if the initial 
ray OA coincides with the terminal ray OB 
then so formed angle is known as one rotation 
angle m∠ AOB = 360°.
Fig. 1.5
 
Straight angle:
After the rotation, if the initial ray OA and 
the terminal ray OB are in opposite directions 
then directed angle so formed is known as 
straight angle (fig. 1.6).
Fig. 1.6
Note that in this case AOB is a straight 
line.
Half of one rotation angle is straight angle.
Right angle:
One fourth of one rotation angle is called 
as one right angle, it is also half of a straight 
angle. One rotation angle is four right angles.
Fig. 1.7
Angles in Standard position :
In the rectangular co-ordinate system, a 
directed angle with its vertex at origin O and 
the initial ray along the positive X-axis, is 
called angle in standard position.
Fig. 1.8
In adjoint Fig. 1.8, ∠XOP, ∠XOQ and 
∠XOR are in standard positions. But, ∠POQ 
is not in standard position.

3
Angle in a Quadrant:
A directed angle in standard position 
is said to be in a particular quadrant if its 
terminal ray lies in that quadrant.
In 
Fig. 
1.8, 
directed 
angles 
∠XOP,
∠XOQ and ∠XOR lie in first, second and 
third quadrants respectively.
Quadrantal Angles:
A directed angle in standard position 
whose terminal ray lies along X-axis or Y-axis 
is called a quadrantal angle. 
Fig. 1.9
In Fig. 1.9, ∠XOP, ∠XOQ, ∠XOR and
∠XOS are all quadrantal angles.  
Co-terminal angles:
Directed angles in standard position having 
the same terminal ray are called co-terminal 
angles.
Fig. 1.10 (a)
Fig. 1.10 (b)
In Fig. 1.10(a), the directed angles having 
measure 30°, 390°, −330° have the same initial 
arm, ray OA and the same terminal arm, ray 
OB. Hence, these angles are co-terminal angles.
If the two directed angles are co-terminal 
angles then difference between measures of 
these two directed angles is an integral multiple 
of 360° e.g. in figure 1.10(a), 390° − (−330)° 
= 720° = 2 × 360°.
1.1.1	 Measures of angles:
The amount of rotation from the initial ray 
OA to the terminal ray OB gives the measure 
of angle AOB. It is measured in two systems.
x

Sexagesimal system (Degree measure)
2)	
Circular system (Radian measure)
1.1.2 Sexagesimal System (Degree Measure):
In this system, the unit of measurement 
of angle is degree.
One rotation angle is divided into 360 
equal parts, the measure of each part is called 
as one degree. 
∴ 
th
1
360
 part of one complete rotation 
is called one degree and is denoted by 1°.

th
1
60
 part of one degree is called one 
minute and is denoted by 1'.
th
1
60
 part of one minute is called one 
second and is denoted by 1''.  
         
	
	
   1° = 60'
	
         1' = 60''
m ∠ (one rotation angle) = 360°
m ∠ (straight angle) = 180°
m ∠ (right angle) = 90°
1.1.3 Circular System (Radian Measure):
In this system, the unit of measurement 
of an angle is a radian.
Let r be the radius of a circle with centre 
O. Let A and B be two points on circle such 
that the length of arc AB is r. Then the 
measure of the central angle AOB is defined 
as 1 radian. It is denoted by 1c. 
Fig. 1.12
Thus, one radian is the measure of an 
angle subtended at the centre of a circle by 
an arc whose length is equal to the radius of 
the circle.
Theorem : 	
The radian so defined is independent of the 
radius of the circle used and πc = 1800.
	
Proof: Let us consider a circle with 
centre at O and radius r. Let AB be an arc of 
length r. Join OA and OB. Then ∠AOB = 1c. 
Produce AO to meet the circle at C. 
Fig. 1.13
	
Clearly, ∠AOC	 =	 a straight angle
	
	
	
=	 2 right angles
	
Since measures of the angles at the centre 
of a circle are proportional to the lengths of 
the corresponding arcs subtending them:
	
∴	 	
	 =

∴	 	
m∠AOB	 =

∴ 1c = m∠AOB = (2 right angles)
π
,  
	
a constant independent of r.
 
Hence one radian is well defined.
	
Also, πc = 2 right angles = 1800. 	

5
Activity 2 : Verify the above result by taking 
the circles having different radii.
	
Let an angle have its measure r in radian 
and θ in degrees. Then its proportion with the 
straight angle is the same in either measure.
	
\ r
p  = 
θ
180   \ rc = θ° × 
p

We use this relation to convert radian 
measure into degree and vice-versa.
Notes:
i)	
To convert degree measure into radian 
measure, multiply degree measure by 
p
180 .
ii)	 To convert radian measure into degree 
measure, multiply radian measure by 180
p .
iii)	 Taking π = 3.14,  
	
we have 1c =

           = 57.3248°
	
Here fractional degree is given in decimal 
fraction. It can be converted into minutes 
and seconds as follows 
	
0.3248°	=	 (0.3248 × 60)'
	
		
=	 19.488'
	
		
=	 19' + (.488 × 60)''
	
		
≈	 19' 29''
	
Thus, 1c = 57° 19' 29''

Ex. 	4) The measures of the angles of the 
triangle are in A. P. The smallest angle 
is 40. Find the angles of the triangle in 
degree and in radian.
Solution : Let the angles of the triangle be 
a − d, a, a + d in degrees.
	
∴ a − d + a + a + d = 180°
	
	
	
∴ 3a = 180°
	
	
	
∴ a = 60° 
	
Also, smallest angle 
	
	
= 40° 
	
∴	 a - d = 40°
	
∴	 60° - d = 40°
	
∴	 60° - 40° = d
	
∴	 d = 20°
	
Now, a + d = 60° + 20° = 80° 
	
Hence the angles are 400, 600, 800 
if they are q1

Find the angles of the triangle in degree.

Here, x - y =

c
	 =

π
	
	
	
= 42° 
	
∴	 x - y = 42° .......... (I)
	
	
The triangle is right angled.
	
∴	 x + y = 90° .......... (II)
	
	
adding, (I) + (II), 
	
	
we get x - y + x + y = 42° + 90°
	
∴	 2x = 132°
	
∴	 x = 66°	
	
	
Put in (I)
	
	
66° - y = 42°	
∴ 66° - 42° = y
	
∴ y = 24° 
∴	 The angles of a triangle are 66°, 90° 	
	
	
and 24°.
Ex. 	6) One angle of a quadrilateral is 2π
9  
radian and the measures of the other 
three angles are in the ratio 3:5:8, find 
their measures in degree.
Solution : The sun of angles of a quadrilateral 
is 360°.
	
One of the angles is given to be 
2π
9
c
 = 2π
9  × 180
π
0
 = 40° 
∴	 Sum of the remainging three angles is 
360° − 40° = 320° 
	
Since these threee angles are in the ratio 
3:5:8.
∴	 Degree measures of these angles are 3k, 	
	
5k, 8k, where k is constant.
∴ 	 3k + 5k + 8k = 320°
∴ 	 16k = 320°
∴ 	 k = 20°
∴ 	 The measures of three angles are
	
	
	
(3k)° = (3 × 20)° = 60°

∴ n = 360

∴ n = 10
	
∴ number of sides of the regular polygon

Ex. 	8) Find the angle between hour hand and 
minute hand of a clock at 
i) 	 Quarter past five
ii) 	 Quarter to twelve
Solution : 
1) 	 When a hour hand moves from one clock 
mark to the next one, it turns through an 
angle of 360°
12
 = 30º.

At 
quarter 
past 
5, 
miniute hand is pointing 
to 3. Hour hand has 
gone past 5. So the 
angle between them is 
more than 60º. In one 
minute hour hand turns 
through

hence 
in 
15 minute it has turned 
through 15

ο
= 7.5º.
Thus the angle between 
the hands is equal to 
60º + 7.5º = 67.5º.
ii) At quarter to twelve, minute hand is pointing 
to 9, hour hand is between 11 and 12 though 
it is nearer 12. It will take 15 minute i.e. 7.5º 
to reach 12. 
∴ the angle between the hands is equal to 
90º − 7.5º = 82.5º.

2.1	 Introduction
Trigonometry is a branch of Mathematics that 
deals with the relation between sides and angles 
of triangles. The word 'trigonometry' is derived 
from the Greek words 'trigonon' and 'metron'. 
It means measuring the sides of triangles. Greek 
Mathematicians used trigonometric ratios to 
determine unknown distances. The Egyptians 
used a primitive form of trigonometry for building 
pyramids in the second millennium BC. Greek 
astronomer Hipparches (190-120 BC)  formulated 
the general principles of trigonometry and he is 
known as the founder of the trigonometry.
We are familiar 
with 
trigonometric 
ratios of acute angles  a 
in right angled triangle. 
We have introduced 
the 
concept 
of 
directed angle having 
any measure, in the 
previous chapter. We 
2
Trigonometry - 1
shall now extend the definitions of trigonometric 
ratios to angles of any measure in terms of co-
ordinates of points on the standard circle.
Let's Recall
We have studied that, in a right angled 
triangle if measure of an acute angle is 'θ', then 
sinθ = opposite side
hypoteneous , cosθ = adjacent side
hypoteneous  ,
tanθ = opposite side
adjacent side . (see fig 2.1 (a))
Also, cosecθ = 
1
sinθ , secθ =
1
cosθ ,			
cotθ = 
1
tanθ .
Let's Learn
2.1.1 Trigonometric functions with the help of 
a circle:
Trigonometric ratios of any angle
	
We have studied that in right angled ∆ ABC, 
'q' is an acute angle 
Fig. 2.1(a)
Fig. 2.1(b)

15
	
cos = adjacent side
hypoteneous = BC
AC
q
	
sin = opposite side
hypoteneous = AB
AC
q
	
We will now extend this definition to any 
angle q, consider q as directed angle, 
	
Let 'q' be an acute angle. [See fig. 2.1 (b)]
	
consider a circle of radius 'r' with centre at 
origin 'O' of the co-ordinate system.
	
OA is the initial ray of angle q, 
	
OB is its terminal ray.
P(x,y) is a point on the circle and on ray OB.
Draw PM ⊥ to OA.
∴ OM = x, PM = y and OP = r.
using ∆ PMO we get,
cos
,
θ = OM
OP = x
r  sin
,
θ = PM
OP = y
r
Now we define, for any θ ∈R

tanθ = y

, cotθ = x
y
        cosecθ = r
y
, secθ = r
x
	
For every angle 'q', there is corresponding 
unique point P(x,y) on the circle, which is on the 
terminal ray of 'q', so trignometric ratios of q are 
also trignometric functions of 'q'.
Note that :	1)	 Trignometric ratios / functions are 
independent of radius 'r'.
	
	
	
2)	 Trignometric ratios of coterminal 
angles are same. 
We consider the circle with center at origin 
and radius r. Let  P (x,y) be the point on the circle 
with m∠MOP = θ 
Since P lies on the circle, OP = r
∴	
x
y
2
2
+
	= r            ∴  r2=x2+y2
The pair (x,y) of co-ordinates of P is uniquely 
determined by θ. Thus x = rcosθ,  y = rsinθ are 
functions of θ. 
Note :
1)	 If  P (x, y) lies 
on the unit circle 
then  cosθ  = x 
and  sinθ = y.  ∴ 
P (x, y) ≡ P(cosθ, 
sinθ)
2)	 The trigonometric 
functions do not 
depend 
on 
the 
position of the 
point on the terminal arm but they depend 
on measure of the angle.
	
Point P(x,y) is 
on 
the 
circle 
of radius r and 
Q (x',y') is on the 
unit circle.
	
C o n s i d e r i n g

triangles.

2.1.2 Signs of trigonometric functions in 
different quadrants :  
	
Trigonometric functions have positive or 
negative values depending on the quadrant 
in which the point 
P(x, y) lies. Let 
us find signs of 
t r i g o n o m e t r i c 
ratios in different 
quadrants. If the 
terminal arm of an 
angle θ intersects 
the unit circle in 
the point P(x, y), 
then cosθ = x,
	
sinθ =y and tanθ = y
x . The values of x and 
y are positive or negative depending on the 
quadrant in which P lies.  
1)	 In the first quadrant (0 < θ < π
2  ), both x and 
	
y are positive, hence 
cosθ = x is positive 
sinθ = y is positive	
tanθ = y
x   is positive 
Hence 
all 
trigonometric functions 
of θ are positive in the 
first quadrant.
2) 	 In the second quadrant ( π
2 < θ < π), y is 
positive and x is negative, hence 
cosθ = y is positive 
sinθ = x is is negative       
tanθ = y
x   is negative
Hence only sinθ is 
positive, cosθ and tanθ 
are negative for θ in the 
second quadrant.
3) 	 In the third quadrant (π < θ < 3π
2  ), both x 
and y are negative, hence 
cosθ = y is negative 
sinθ = x is negative
tanθ = y
x   is positive
Hence only tanθ is 
positive, sinθ and cosθ 
are negative for θ in the 
third quadrant.
4) 	 In the fourth quadrant (3π
2 < θ < 2π), x is 
positive and y is negative, hence 
sinθ = y is negative
cosθ = x is positive 
tanθ = y
x   is negative 
Hence only cosθ is 
positive; sinθ and tanθ 
are negative for θ in the 
fourth quadrant.
You can check sinθ & cosecθ, have the 
same sign, cosθ & secθ have the same sign  and 
simillarly tanθ & cotθ have the same sign, when 
they exists.
Remark: Signs of cosecθ, secθ and cotθ are 
same as signs of sinθ, cosθ and tanθ respectively. 
2.1.3 Range of  cosθ and sinθ :   P(x, y) is point 
on the unit circle. m∠AOB = θ.  OP = 1 
 
∴ x2  + y2 = 1
 
∴ x2  ≤ 1  and y2 ≤ 1
 
∴ -1 ≤ x ≤1 and -1 ≤ y ≤ 1
 
∴ -1 ≤ cosθ ≤ 1 and -1 ≤ sinθ ≤ 1

SOLVED EXAMPLE
Ex.1.	Find the signs of the following : 
	
i)  sin 300°   ii) cos 400°   iii) cot (−206°)  
Solution: 
(For given θ, we need to find coterminal angle 
which lies between 0° and 360°)
i)	
270°  < 300°  < 360°  
 
∴ 300°  angle lies in the fourth quadrant.
 
∴  sin 300° is negative.
ii)	 400° = 360° + 40°   
 
∴ 400° and 40° are co-terminal angles 
(hence their trigonometric ratios are 
same) 
	
	
Since 40° lies in the first quadrant, 400° 
also lies in the first quadrant.
 
∴  cos 400° is positive.
iii)	 −206° = −360° + 154°  
	
154° and  −206° are coterminal angles. Since 
154° lies in the second quadrant, therefore 
cot (−206°) is negative.

∴  sin0° = 0, cos0° = 1, 
and tan0°  = 0

3) 	 Angle of measure 360° or (2π)c  : Since  360°

Fundamental Identities
2.2	 Fundamental Identities :
A trigonometric identity represents a 
relationship that  always holds for all admissible 
values in the domain. For example cosecθ = 1
sinθ 
is true for all admissible values of θ. Hence this 
is an identity. Identities enable us to simplify 
complicated expressions. They are basic tools 
of trigonometry which are being used in solving 
trigonometric equations. 
The fundamental identities of trigonometry, 
namely. 
1) 	
sin2 θ + cos2 θ = 1,
	
using this identity we can derive simple 
relations in trigonometry functions
	
e.g. cosθ = ±

sinθ = ±

2
cos θ   
2) 	
1 + tan2 θ = sec2 θ
3) 	
1 + cot2 θ = cosec2 θ
These relations are called fundamental 
identities of trigonometry.
2.2.1 Domain and Range of Trigonometric 
functions : Now we will find domain and 
range of trigonometric functions expressed 
as follows.
We now study sin θ, cos θ, tan θ as functions 
of real variable θ . Here θ is measured in radians.
We have defined sinθ  and cos θ, where θ is 
a real number. If  a and θ  are co-terminal angles 
and if 0° ≤ α ≤ 360°, then sin θ = sinα, and cos θ 
= cosα. Hence the  domain of these function is R. 
Let us find the range sin θ and cos θ 
We have, sin2θ + cos2θ = 1
i) 	
Consider y = sinθ where θ ∈ R and 
y ∈ [-1. 1] 

23
	
The domain of sine function is R and range 
is [-1, 1].
Fig. 2.15
ii) 	 Consider y = cosθ where θ ∈ R and 
	
y ∈ [-1, 1]  
	
The domain of cosine function is R and 
range is [-1, 1].
iii) 	 Consider y = tanθ, tanθ  does not exist for 
θ = ± π
2 , ± 3π
2 , ± 5π
2  .....
	
In general tanθ does not exist if θ = 
(2n + 1) π
2 , where n ∈ I
Fig. 2.17
	
The domain of tanθ is R except 
	
θ = (2n + 1) π
2 ,	
	
As θ → π
2
-,  tanθ → + ∞ and as θ → π
2
+, 
tanθ → - ∞.
	
Since tanθ = x
y , value of tanθ can be any 
real number, range of tan function is R. 
iv)	 Consider y = cosecθ  
	
cosecθ does not exist for θ = 0, ±π, ±2π, 
±3 π ... 
	
In general cosecθ does not exist if θ = nπ, 
where n ∈ I.
	
The domain of cosecθ is R except θ = nπ.  
	
The domain of sine function is R and range 
is [-1, 1].
	
Now as -1 ≤ sinθ ≤ 1, cosecθ ≥ 1
	
	
or cosecθ ≤ - 1.                                      
 
∴ The range of cosec function is 
	
{y ∈ R : |y| ≥ 1} = R - (-1, 1) 
Fig. 2.16
Fig. 2.18

24
v) 	 Consider y = secθ 
	
secθ does not exist for θ = ± π
2 , ±3π
2 , 
±5π
2  ...
	
In general secθ does not exist if 
	
θ = (2n + 1) π
2 , where n ∈ I. 
	
The domain of secθ is R except 
	
θ = (2n + 1) π
2 ,   
	
Now as -1 ≤ cosθ ≤ 1, secθ ≥ 1 or secθ ≤ -1 
 	
∴ The range of sec function is 
	
{y ∈ R : |y| ≥ 1} = R - (-1, 1)
Fig. 2.19
vi) 	 Consider y = cotθ 
	
cotθ does not exist for θ = 0, ±π, ±2π, 
±3π ...
	
In general cotθ does not exist if θ = nπ, 
where n ∈ I. 
	
The domain of cotθ is R except θ = nπ, and 
range is R.  
	
	
Since cotθ = x
y , value of cotθ can be any 
real number, range of cot function is R.
2.2.2	Periodicity of Trigonometric functions: 
A function is said to be a periodic function  
if there exists a constant p such that ƒ(x + p) 
= ƒ(x)  for all x in the domain. 
∴ ƒ(x) = ƒ(x + p) = ƒ(x + 2p) = . . . = ƒ(x - p) = 
ƒ(x - 2p) =  . . .
The smallest positive value of p which 
satisfies the above relation is called the 
fundamental period or simply the period of ƒ.
Ex. sin(x + 2π) = sin(x + 4π) = sinx = sin(x - 2π) 
= sin(x - 4π) 
Thus sinx is a periodic function with period 
2π.
Similarly cosx, cosecx and secx are periodic 
functions with period 2π.
But tanx and cotx are periodic functions with 
period π.  Because of tan (x+π) = tan x for all x.

2.9 Graphs of trigonometric functions :
Introduction : In this section we shall study the 
graphs of trigonometric functions. Consider x 
to be a real number or measure of an angle in 
radian. We know that all trigonometric functions 
are periodic. The periods of sine and cosine 
functions is 2π and the period of tangent function 
is π. These periods are measured in radian.
  (i)	 The graph of sine function: 
	
Consider y = sinx, for - π < x < π. Here x 
represents a variable angle. The table of 
values is as follows:

Using the result sin(- θ) = -sinθ, we have 
following table:

Take the horizontal axis to be the X- axis and the 
vertical axis to be the Y− axis.  
Fig. 2.21
The graph of y = sinx is shown above. Since 
the period  of sine function is 2π It means that 
take the curve and shift it 2π to left or right, then 
the   curve falls back on itself. Also note that the 
graph is with in one unit of the Y− axis. The graph 
increases and decreases periodically.
 (ii) The graph of cosine function: Consider 
y = cosx, for -π < x < π. Here x represents 
a variable angle. The table of values is as 
follows:
x

Take the horizontal axis to be the X- axis and the 
vertical axis to be the Y− axis.  

26
The graph of y = cosx is shown below. Since the 
period of cosine function is 2π. It means that 
take the curve and shift it 2π to left or right, then 
the curve falls back on itself. Also note that the 
graph is with in one unit of the Y− axis. The graph 
increases and decreases periodically. 
Fig. 2.22
(iii)	The graph of tangent function: 
	
Let y = tanx for - π
2  < x < π
2   
	
Note that does not exist for x = π
2 . As x 
increases from 0 to π
2   : 
  	
1)  sinx increases from 0 to 1 and 
  	
2)  cosx decreases from 1 to 0.
	
∴ tanx = sinx
cosx  will increase indefinitely as x 
starting from 0 approaches to π
2 .  Similarly 
starting from 0 approaches to - π
2 , tanx 
decreases indefinitely. The corresponding 
values of x ad y are as in the following table:

tan2θ  = 4
∴  tan2 θ + 2 +

tan2θ   = 4
∴  tan2 θ +

Solution :

=	 2cos2 θ -1 ≠ LHS
Since the LHS ≠ RHS, given equation is not true.
ii)	 cot A-tan B
cot B-tan A  =  cot A tan B
	 Solution : Substitute  A = B = 45°
LHS	 =  
cot 45°-tan 45°
cot 45°-tan 45°  
	
=	 1 - 1
1 + 1  = 0
1 = 0
	
   
RHS = cot 45° tan 45° = 1
As LHS ≠ RHS, the given equation is not 
true.
Note : 'One counter example is enough' to prove 
that a mathematical statement is wrong.	
iii)  cos θ
­1-tan θ  +  sin θ
­1-cot θ     = sin θ + cos θ
 LHS =  cos θ
­1-tan θ   +  sin θ

=	 sin θ + cos θ = RHS
Since the LHS = RHS, given equation is true.
Ex.3 If 5 tan A = 
2 , π < A < 3π
2  and
sec B = 11 , 3π
2   < B < 2π then find the value of 
cosec A - tan B.
Solution : 5 tan A =

∴ tan A =

 ∴  cosecA = -

Now  sec B = 11
As tan2 B = sec2 B - 1 = 10
Thus, tan2 B = 10 and 3π
2  < B < π (the fourth 
quadrtant)
∴ tan B = -

Now cosecA - tan B = -

  ∴ cotθ = 7

28
Since,  cosec2θ  = 1 + cot2θ 
sec2θ = 1 + tan2θ
∴ cosec2θ  − sec2θ  =	 cot2θ  − tan2θ  
∴ cosec2θ  + sec2θ  =	 cot2θ + tan2θ  + 2

= (cos2θ + sin2θ)3 −3cos2θ sin2θ (cos2θ +sin2θ)    
= 1−3sin2θ  cos2θ   (Since sin2θ + cos2θ =1)

Ex.6	 Eliminate θ from the following :

	(ii) x = a cos3θ,   y = b sin3θ
 (iii) x = 2+3cosθ,   y = 5+3sinθ
Solution :  
(i)	 x = a cosθ, y = b sinθ

Ex.7	 If 2sin2θ + 7cosθ = 5 then find the 
permissible values of cosθ .
Solution : We know that sin2θ = 1−cos2θ  
Given equation 2sin2θ + 7cosθ =5 becomes 
	
2(1−cos2θ) + 7cosθ =5
∴	 2−2cos2θ + 7cosθ −5 = 0
∴	 2cos2θ − 7cosθ +3 = 0
∴	 2cos2θ − 6cosθ −cosθ +3 = 0
∴ (2cosθ − 1)(cosθ −3) = 0
∴	 cosθ = 3  or cosθ = 1

But cosθ cannot be greater than 1 
∴ Permissible value of cosθ is 1

2.2.4 Polar Co-ordinate system : Consider O as 
the origin and OX as X-axis. P (x,y) is any point 
in the plane. Let OP = r and m∠XOP = θ. Then 
the ordered pair (r, θ) determines the position of 
point P. Here (r, θ) are called the polar coordinates 
of P. The fixed point O is called the Pole and the 
fixed ray OX is called as the polar axis.

The Cartesian co-ordinates of the point P(r, θ)

Let's Recall
In the previous chapter we have studied 
trigonometric functions in different quadrants.
3.1	 Compound angle : Compound angles are 
sum or difference of  given angles. 
	
Following are theorems about trigonometric 
functions of sum and difference of two 
angles. 
  Let's Derive
Theorem : 1) For any two angles A and B, 
cos (A-B) =  cos A cosB + sinA sin B
Proof :	
Draw a unit standard 
circle. Take points  P 
and Q on the circle 
so that OP makes 
an angle A with 
positive X-axis and 
OQ makes an angle 
B 
with 
positive 
X-axis. 
∴	 m∠XOP = A, m∠XOQ = B. 
 
From figure OP = OQ = 1
∴ 		 Co-ordinates of P and Q are  (cosA,sinA) 
and (cosB, sinB) respectively .
∴	   d(PQ)

Now consider OQ as new X-axis.
∴ m∠QOP = A-B
∴Co-ordinates of  P and Q are 
(cos (A−B), sin(A−B)) and (1,0) respectively.
P ≡ (cos (A−B), sin (A−B)),Q ≡ (1,0)

From equation (1) and (2) we get
2−2 cos (A−B) = 2−2 (cosAcosB+sinA sinB)
∴ −2 cos (A−B) = −2 (cosA cosB+sinA SinB)
∴  cos (A−B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B
Theorem : 2) For any two angles A and B , 
cos (A+B) = cos Acos B − sin A sin B 
Proof :  We know that	
cos (x−y) = cosx cosy + sinx siny	
Put  x =  A, y  = − B we get
cos (A+B) = cosA cosB+sinA (-sinB)
∵ cos(−θ) = cosθ,   sin(−θ) = −sinθ
  ∴ cos(A+B) = cosAcosB − sinA sinB

3.2 Trigonometric functions of allied angels.
Allied angles : If the sum or difference of the 
measures of two angles is an integral multiple of 
π
2 then these angles are said to be allied angles.

 are its allied 
angles. 
We have already proved the following results :
1) sin ( π
2  − q) = cos q, cos ( π
2  − q) = sinq, 
	
tan ( π
2  − q)= cot q
2)	 sin ( π
2  + q) = cos q, cos ( π
2  + q) = -sinq,  
	
tan ( π
2 +q) = - cot q
Similarly we can also prove the following results :
1) sin (π - q) = sin q, cos (π - q) = - cosq,  
	
tan (π-q)= -tan q
2)	 sin (π + q) = -sin q, cos (π + q) = - cosq,  
	
tan (π+q) = tan q
3)	 sin (3π
2  - q) = − cos q, cos (3π
2  − q) = -sinq, 
	
tan (3π
2  − q) = cot q
4)	 sin (3π
2  + q) = − cos q, cos (3π
2  + q) = sinq, 
	
tan (3π
2  + q)= -cot q
5)	 sin (2π - q) = -sin q, cos (2π - q) 
	
= cosq , tan (2π-q)= -tan q

= 2sinqcosq.cosq + (1- 2 sin2q)  sinq
	
= 2sinqcos2q + sinq − 2sin3q
	
= 2sinq (1- sin2q) + sinq - 2sin3q

Solution : πc

Let, q = 18°, 2q = 36°, 3q = 54°
We have  	
2q + 3q = 90°
	
	
2q = 90° - 3q 
	
∴	
sin 2q = sin (90° - 3q)
	
	
2sin q.cos q = cos 3 q
	
∴	
2sin q.cos q = 4.cos3 q - 3 cosq
	
	
2sin q = 4.cos2 q - 3  
	
	
2sin q = 4 (1 - sin2q) - 3 
	
	
2sin q = 4 - 4sin2q - 3

sum or difference :
For any angles A and B
1) 2sin A cos B = sin (A + B)  + sin (A - B)
2)	 2cos  A sin B = sin (A + B)  -  sin (A  - B)
3)	 2cos A cos B = cos (A + B)  + cos (A  - B)
4)	 2sin A sin B = cos (A - B)  - cos (A + B)

      =  sin (90° -  50°) -  cos70°                         
 
      =  cos 50° -  cos70°

3.5 Trigonometric functions of angles of a 
triangle 
Notation: In D ABC;  m∠BAC = A, 
	
m∠ABC = B, m∠ACB = C
	
∴ A + B + C =  p
Result 1) In  D ABC,  A + B + C = p 	
	
∴ A + B =  p - C
	
∴   sin  (A + B) =  sin  (p - C)
	
∴   sin  (A + B) =  sin C	
	
	
Simillarly:
	
sin  (B + C) =  sin A      and	
	
sin  (C + A) =  sin B

52
Result 2)  In DABC,   A+B+C = p	
	
    ∴ B + C =  p - C	
	
	
    ∴ cos (B +C) = cos (p - A)
	
    ∴ cos (B + C) =  - cos A 
Simillarly:
	
cos (A + B) = - cos C     and

4.1	 Introduction
We have learnt to solve simultaneous 
equations in two  variables using determinants. 
We will now learn more about the determinants 
because 
they 
are 
useful 
in 
Engineering 
applications, and Economics, etc.
The concept of a determinant was 
discussed by the German Mathematician G.W. 
Leibnitz (1676-1714) and Cramer (1750) 
developed the rule for solving linear equations 
using determinants.
Let's Recall
4.1.1 Value of a Determinant
In standard X we have studied a method of 
solving simultaneous equations in two unknowns 
using determinants of order two.  In this chapter, 
we shall study determinants of order three.
The representation 
a b
c d  is defined as the 
determinant of order two. Numbers a, b, c, d 
are called elements of the determinant. In this 
arrangement, there are two rows and two columns.
a
b
c
d
  
	
	
  	
    	
  
The value of the determinant  
a b
c d  is  
ad - bc.

4.1.2 Determinant of order 3
Definition - A determinant of order 3 is 
a square arrangement of 9 elements enclosed 
between two vertical bars. The elements are 
arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns as given below.

Here   aij represents the element in ith row and 
jth column of the determinant. 
e.g.   a31 represents the element in 3rd row and 
1st column.
In general, we denote determinant by Capital 
Letters or by ∆ (delta).
We can wirte the rows and columns 
separately. e.g. here the 2nd row is [a21  a22  a23] 
and 3rd column is

Expansion of Determinant
We will find the value or expansion of a 3x3 
determinant.We give here the expansion by  the 
1st row of the determinant D.
There are six ways of expanding a 
determinant of order 3, corresponding to each 
of three rows (R1, R2, R3) and three columns 
(C1, C2, C3).

 be a given determinant.
Definitions
The minor of aij - It is defined as the 
determinant obtained by eliminating the ith row 
and jth column of A. That is the row and the 
column that contain the element aij are omitted. 
We denote the minor of the element aij by Mij
In case of above determinant A

Similarly we can find minors of other 
elements.
Cofactor of aij - 
 cofactor of aij = (−1)i+j minor of aij  = Cij
∴ Cofactor of element aij  = Cij = (−1)i+j Mij
The same definition can also be given for 
elements in 2×2 determinant. Thus in a

d
The minor of a is d.
The minor of b is c.
The minor of c is b.
The minor of d is a

4.2   Properties of Determinants
In the previous section we have learnt how 
to expand the determinant. Now we will study 
some properties of determinants. They will help 
us to evaluate the determinant more easily.
∙ Let's Verify...         
Property 1 - The value of determinant 
remains unchanged if its rows are turned into 
columns and columns are turned into rows.

= a1 (b2 c3 - b3c2) - a2(b1c3 + c1b3) + 
a3(b1c2  - c1b2)
    
 
=  a1(b2 c3 - b3c2) - b1(a2c3 - a3c2) + 
c1(a2b3 - b2a3)                      ---------- (ii)
From  (i) and (ii) D= D1
Ex.
Let A  =

=  -5 - 6 - 6
        
=  -17        ................................ (i)
by interchanging rows and columns of A we get 
determinant A1
A1  	=

=  -5 -12
  
=  -17     .......................................(ii)
∴ A = A1 from (i) and (ii)
Property 2 - If any two rows (or columns) of 
the determinant are interchanged then the value 
of determinant changes its sign. 
The operation Ri ↔ Rj change the sign of the 
determinant.
Note : We denote the interchange of rows by 
Ri ↔ Rj and interchange of columns by Ci ↔ Cj.
Property 3 - If any two rows (or columns) 
of a determinant are identical then the value of 
determinant is zero.

65
R1 ↔ R2   D = D1
then D1 = −D         ....... (property 2)         ...... (I)
But R1 = R2       hence D1 = D                  .......... (II)
∴ adding I and II
2D1 = 0  ⇒ D1 = 0
i.e. D = 0 
Property 4 - If each element of a row (or 
a column) of determinant is multiplied by a 
constant k then the value of the new determinant 
is k times the value of given determinant.
The operation Ri → kRi gives multiple of the 
determinant by k.
Remark  i) Using this property we can take 
out any common factor from any  one row (or any 
one column) of the given determinant
ii) If corresponding elements of any two rows 
(or columns) of determinant are proportional 
(in the same ratio) then the value of the 
determinant is zero.
Property 5 - If each element of a row 
(or column) is expressed as the sum of two 
numbers then the determinant can be expressed 
as sum of two determinants
For example,
     	
         
a

Property 6 - If a constant multiple of all 
elements of any row (or column) is added to 
the corresponding elements of any other row 
(or column ) then the value of new determinant 
so obtained is the same as that of the original 
determinant. The operation Ri ↔ Ri + kRj does 
not change the value of the determinant.

Remark : If more than one operation from 
above are done, make sure that these operations 
are completed one at a time. Else there can be 
mistake in calculation.
Main diagonal of determinant : The main 
diagonal (principal diagonal) of determinant A is 
collection of entries aij  where i = j 
OR

4.3 APPLICATIONS OF DETERMINANTS
4.3.1 Cramer's Rule 
In linear algebra Cramer's rule is an explicit 
formula for the solution of a system of linear 
equations in many variables. In previous class 
we studied this with two variables. Our goal here 
is to expand the application of Cramer's rule to 
three equations in three variables (unknowns) . 
Variables are usually denoted by x, y and z. 
Theorem - Consider the following three linear 
equations in variables three x, y, z. 
a1x + b1y + c1z = d1
a2x + b2y +c2z = d2
a3x + b3y + c3z = d3
Here ai , bi , ci and di are constants.
The solution of this system of equations is
x = 
Dx

Dy

in QR code. 
2) If D = 0 then there is no unique solution for 
the given system of equations.

4.3.2	 Consistency of three equations in two 
variables
Consider the system of three linear equations 
in two variables x and y
a1x+ b1y +c1  = 0   
(I)
a2x+ b2y +c2 = 0 
            (II)
a3x+ b3y +c3 = 0    
 
(III)
These three equations are said to be 
consistent if they have a common solution.
Theorem : The necessary condition for the 
equations a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 , a2x + b2y + c2 = 0, 
a3x + b3y + c3 = 0 to be consistent is

But the equations have no common Solution. 
Equations are not consistent.
Ex. 2) Examine the consistency of following 
equations.
   i) x + y = 2,   2x +3y = 5,    3x − 2y = 1
Solution : Write the given equation in standard 
form.
x + y − 2 = 0,  2x +3y − 5 = 0,   3x − 2y − 1 = 0
Solving first two equations, we get x=1, y=1.
And (1,1) satisfy the third equation.
∴ Given equations have a common solution.
∴ Given system of equations is consistent.
ii) x + 2y − 3 = 0,   7x + 4y − 11 = 0,

Let us examine further. 
Note that lines given by the equations 
x + y = 1 and 3x + 3y = 5 are parallel to each 
other. They do not have a common solution, so 
equations are not consistent.
Ex. 3)	 Find the value of k if the following 
equations are consistent.
 
7x - ky = 4 ,    2x + 5y = 9 and   2x + y = 8
Solution : Given equations 
7x - ky - 4 = 0,    2x  + 5y -9 = 0,

2x + y - 8 = 0  are consistent

Remark: 
	
i) Area is a positive quantity. Hence we 
always take the absolute value of a determinant.
ii) If area is given, consider both positive and 
negative values of the determinant for calculation 
of unknown co-ordinates.
iii) If area of a triangle is zero then the given 
three points are collinear.
SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ex. 1) Find the area of the triangle whose vertices 
are A(−2, −3) , B(3, 2) and C(−1, −8)
Solution : Given (x1, y1) = (−2, −3), (x2, y2) = 
(3, 2), and (x3, y3) = (−1 , −8)

Area is positive.    
∴ Area of triangle = 15 square unit
This gives the area of the triangle ABC 
in that order of the vertices. If we consider the 
same triangle as ACB, then triangle is considered 
in opposite orientation. The area then is 15 
sq. units. This also agrees with the rule that 
interchanging 2nd and 3rd rows changes the sign 
of the determinant. 
Ex. 2) If the area of triangle with vertices 
P(−3, 0), Q(3, 0) and R(0, K) is 9 square 
unit then find the value of k.
Solution : Given (x1, y1) ≡ (-3, 0), (x2, y2) 
≡ (3, 0) and (x3, y3) ≡ (0, k) and area of ∆ is 9 sq. 
unit.

4.4	 Introduction to Matrices : 
The theory of matrices was developed by 
a Mathematician Arthur Cayley. Matrices are 
useful in expressing numerical information 
in compact form. They are effectively used 
in expressing different operators. Hence in 
Economics, Statistics and Computer science they 
are essential.  
Definition : A rectangular arrangement of mn  
numbers in m rows and n columns, enclosed in 
[   ] or (   ) is called a matrix of order m by n.  
A matrix by itself does not have a value or any 
special meaning.
Order of the matrix is denoted by m × n, read as 
m by n.
Each member of the matrix is called an element 
of the matrix.
Matrices are generally denoted by A, B, C ,... and 
their elements are denoted by aij, bij, cij, ... etc. 
e.g. aij is the element in ith row and jth column of 
the matrix.
For example,  i) A =

Let A  = [ aij]nxn be a square matrix of order n then 
(i)  The elements a11,  a22, a33,... aii ... ann are called the 
diagonal elements of matrix A. 
 
Note that the diagonal elements are defined 
only for a square matrix.
(ii) Elements aij, where i ≠ j are called non 
diagonal elements of matrix A.
(iii) Elements aij, where i < j represent elements 
above the diagonal.
(iv)  Elements aij, where i > j represent elements 
below the diagonal.
Statements iii) and iv) can be verified by observing 
square matrices of different orders.

of the elements of A also gives us a determinant, 
by replacing square brackets by vertical bars. It is 
denoted by |A| or det(A).

4.5	 Algebra of Matrices : 
(1)  Equality of matrices 
(2)  Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar 
(3)  Addition of matrices   
(4)  Multiplication of two matrices.     
(1)	 Equality of matrices : Two matrices A and 
B are said to be equal if (i) order of A = order 
of B and (ii) corresponding elements of 
A and B are same, that is if aij=bij for;  all i,j 
and symbolically written as A=B.

then using definition of equality of matrices, we 
have 2a - b = 1  ......(1)   and  a + 3b = 2  ...... (2) 
Solving equations (1) and (2), we get  a = 5
7   and 
b = 3

(2)	 Multiplication of a Matrix by a scalar: 
If A is any matrix and k is a scalar, then 
the matrix obtained by multiplying each 
element of A by the scalar k is called the 
scalar multiple of the given matrix A and is 
denoted by kA.  
Thus if  A =  [aij]mxn and k is any scalar then 
kA = [kaij]mxn. 
 
Here the order of matrix A and kA are same.
Ex.  A  = 
1

 and  k =

(3)	 Addition of Two matrices : A and B are 
two matrices of same order. Their addition 
denoted by A + B is a matrix obtained 
by adding the corresponding elements of A 
and B. 
Note: A+B is possible only when Aand B are 
of same order.  
A+B is of the same order as that of A and B. 
 
Thus if A = [ aij]mxn  and  B = [ bij]mxn then A+B 
= [ aij + bij]mxn

Some Results on addition and scalar 
multiplication : If A, B, C are three matrices 
conformable for addition and α, β are scalars, 
then
(i) A+B = B+A, That is, the matrix addition is 
commutative. 
(ii) (A+B)+C = A+(B+C), That is, the matrix 
addition is associative.
(iii) For matrix A, we have A+O = O+A = A, That 
is, a zero matrix is conformable for addition 
and it is the identity for matrix addition.
(iv)  For a matrix A, we have A+(−A) = (−A) +A 
= O, where O is a zero matrix  conformable 
with matrix A for addition. Where (−A) is 
additive inverse of A. 
(v) α(A±B) = αΑ ± αB  
(vi) (α ± β)A = αΑ ± βA
(vii)  α(β·A) = (α·β)·A  
(viii) OA = O

(4)	 Algebra of Matrices (continued) 
Two Matrices A and B are said to be 
conformable for the product AB if the number of 
columns in A is equal to the number of rows in B. 
i.e. A is of order mxn and B is of order nxp. 
In This case the product AB is amatrix 
defined as follows. 
Am×n × Bn×p = Cm×p ,  where Cij =

Solution : Since number of columns of 
A = number of rows of B = 3 
Therefore product AB is defined and its order 
is 1. (A)1×3 (B)3×1 = (AB)1×1 
AB = [a11 × b11 +   a12 × b21   + a13 × b31]

From the above solved numerical Examples, for 
the given matrices A and B we note that,  
i)  If AB exists , BA may or may not exist.
ii)  If BA exists , AB may or may not exist.
iii)  If AB and BA both exist they may not 
be equal.                                                                                     
4.6	 Properties of Matrix Multiplication : 
1)  For

A 
and 
B, 
matrix 
multiplication is not commutative that 
is AB ≠ BA.
2)  For three matrices A,B,C. Matrix 
multiplication is associative. That is 
(AB)C = A(BC) if orders of matrices 
are suitable for multiplication.

From (1) and (2), (AB)C = A(BC) 
3) For three matrices A,B,C, multiplication 
is distributive over addition.
 i) A(B+C)= AB + AC   
 
(left distributive law)
ii) (B+C)A= BA + CA   
 
(right distributive law)
These laws can be verified by examples.
4)  For a given square matrix A there exists 
a unit matrix I of the same order as that 
of A, such that AI=IA=A. 
 
 I is called  Identity  matrix for matrix 
multiplication.
e.g.  Let A =

Remark
Using the distributive laws discussed earlier 
we can derive the following results,
If  A and B are square matrices of the same 
order, then 
i)   (A + B)2 = A2 + AB + BA + B2  
ii)   (A - B)2 = A2 - AB - BA + B2 
iii)  (A + B) (A- B)= A2 + AB - BA - B2

25) Jay and Ram are two friends in a class. Jay 
wanted to buy 4 pens and 8 notebooks, Ram 
wanted to buy 5 pens and 12 notebooks. 
Both of them went to a shop. The price 
of a pen and a notebook which they have 
selected was Rs.6 and Rs.10. Using  Matrix 
multiplication, find the amount required 
from each one of them.
4.7 Properties of transpose of a matrix :
Note :
(1) For any matrix A, (AT)T = A.
(2) If A is a matrix and k is constant, 
then (kA)T = kAT 
(3) If A and B are two matrices of same order, 
then  (A + B)T = AT + BT 
(4) If A and B are conformable for the product 
AB, then (AB)T = BT AT

Minor Mij of the element aij is determinant 
obtained by deleting the ith row and jjth column of

Cij = (-1)i+j Mij
•	
Properties of determinant
Property (i) - The value of determinant remains 
unchanged if  its rows are turned into columns 
and columns are turned into rows.
Property (ii) - If any two rows (or columns) of 
the determinant are interchanged then the value 
of determinant changes  its sign.
Property (iii) - If any two rows (or columns) 
of a determinant are identical then the value of 
determinant is zero
Property (iv) - If any element of a row (or column) 
of determinant is multiplied by a constant k then 
the value of the new determinant is k times the 
value of old determinant
Property (v) -  If each element of a row (or 
column) is expressed as the sum of two numbers 
then the determinant can be expressed as sum of 
two determinants

99
Property (vi) - If a constant multiple of all 
elements of  a row (or column) is added to the 
corresponding elements of any other row (or 
column) then the value of new determinant 
so obtained is the same as that of the original 
determinant.
Property (vii) - (Triangle property) - If each 
element of a determinant above or below the main 
diagonal is zero then the value of the determinant 
is equal to the product of its diagonal elements.

• 	 Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar:
	
If A [aij] is a matrix and k is a scalar, then kA = 
[kaij].
•	 Addition of matrices:
	
Matrices A = [aij] and B = [bij] are said to 
conformable for addition if orders of A and B 
are same.
	
A+B = [aij + bij] . The order of A+B is the same 
as that of A and B.
• Multiplication of two matrices:
	
A and B are said to be conformable for the 
multiplication if number of columns of A is 
equal to the number of rows of B.
	
That is If A = [aik]m×p and B = [bkj]p×n, then AB 
is defined and AB = [cij]m×n where

• If A = [aij]m×n  is any matrix, then the transpose 
of A is denoted by AT = B = [bij]n×m and bij = aji
• If A is a square matrix, then
 i)  A + AT is a symmetric matrix.
ii)  A − AT is a skew-symmetric matrix.
• Every square matrix A can be expressed as

•
Locus of a points in a co-ordinate plane
•
Equations of line in different forms
•	
Angle between two lines, perpendicular
and parallel lines
•
Distance of a point from a line
•
Family of lines
Let's Recall
We are familiar with the properties of 
straight lines, the bisector of an angle, circle 
and triangles etc.
	We 
will 
now 
introduce 
co-ordinate 
geometry in the study of a plane. Every point 
has got pair of co-ordinates and every pair of 
co-ordinate gives us a point in the plane.
We will use this and study the curves with 
the help of co-ordinates of the points. 
What is the perpendicular bisector of a 
segment  ? ............... A line.
What is the bisector of an angle ? .......A ray.
 
These geometrical figures are sets of points 
in plane which satisfy certain conditions.
•
The perpendicular bisector of a segment is
the set of points in the plane which are
equidistant from the end points of  the
segment. This set is a line.
•
The bisector of an angle is the set of points
in the plane which are equidistant from the
arms of the angle. This set is a ray.
Activity :  Draw segment AB of length 6 cm. 
Plot a few points which are equidistant from 
A and B. Verify that they are collinear.
Let's  Learn
5.1 Locus : A set of points in a plane 
which satisfy certain geometrical condition 
(or conditions) is called a locus.
L = {P | P is a point in the plane and P
     satisfies given geometrical condition}
Here P is the representative of all points in L.
L is called the locus of point P. Locus is a 
set of points. 
The locus can also be described as the route of 
a point which moves while satisfying required 
conditions. eg. planets in solar system.
Illustration :
•
The perpendicular bisector of segment AB
is the set
M = { P | P is a point such that PA=PB}.
•
The bisector of angle AOB is the set :
D = { P | P is a point such that         
P is equidistant from OA and OB } 
    = { P | ∠ POA = ∠ POB }
Verify that the sets defined above are the same. 
The plural of locus is loci.
Fig. 5.1
•
The circle with center O and radius 4 is
the set L = { P | OP = 4}

5.1.1 Equation of Locus : If the set of points, 
whose co-ordinates satisfy a certain equation in 
x and y, is the same as the set of points on 
a locus, then the equation is said to be the 
equation of the locus.
SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ex.1 We know that the y co-ordinate of every 
point on the X-axis is zero and this is true 
for points on the X-axis only. Therefore 
the equation of the X-axis is y = 0.
Ex.2 Let L = {P | OP = 4}. Find the equation 
of L.
Fig. 5.2
Solution : L is the locus of points in the 
plane which are at 4 unit distance from 
the origin.
Let P(x, y) be any point on the locus L.
As OP = 4, OP2 = 16
∴ (x − 0)2 + (y − 0)2 = 16
∴ x2 + y2 = 16 
This is the equation of locus L. 
The locus is seen to be a circle
Ex.3 Find the eqation of the locus of points 
which are equidistant from A(−3, 0) and 
B(3, 0). Identify the locus.
Solution : Let P(x, y) be any point on the 
required locus. 
	
	 P is equidistant from A and B.
 
 ∴ PA = PB
 
 ∴ PA2 = PB2   
 
 ∴ (x + 3)2 + (y − 0)2 = (x − 3)2 + 
(y −0)2
 
 ∴ x2 + 6x + 9 + y2 = x2 − 6x + 9 + y2
 
 ∴ 12x = 0
 
 ∴ x = 0. The locus is the Y-axis.
5.1.2 Shift of Origin : Let O′(h, k) be a point 
in the XY plane and the origin be shifted to 
O′. Let O′X′, O′Y′ be the new co-ordinate 
axes through O′ and parallel to the axes OX 
and OY respectively. 
Fig. 5.3
Let (x, y) be the co-ordinates of P referred to 
the co-ordinates axes OX, OY and (x', y') be 
the co-ordinates of P referred to the co-ordinate 
axes O′X′, O′Y′. To find relations between 
(x, y) and (x', y').
Draw PL ⊥ OX and suppose it intersects O′X′ 
in L′. 
Draw PM ⊥ OY and suppose it intersects O′Y′ 
in M′.
Let O′Y′ meet line OX in N and O′X′ meet 
OY in T. 
∴ ON = h, OT = k, OL = x, OM = y, 
O′L′ = x', O′M′ = y'
Now x = OL = ON + NL = ON + O′ L′ 

105
= h + x'
and  y  =  OM = OT + TM = OT + O′ M′ = 
k + y' 
 
∴ x = x' + h, y = y' + k 
These equations are known as the formulae for 
shift of origin.
Note that the new co-ordinates can also be 
given by (X, Y) or (u,v) in place of (x',y').
SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ex. 1) If the origin is shifted to the point 
O'(3, 2) the directions of the axes remaining 
the same, find the new co-ordinates of the 
points 
(a)A(4, 6) (b) B(2,−5).
Solution : We have (h, k) = (3,2) 
    x = x' + h, y = y' + k 
	
∴ x = x' + 3. and y = y' + 2 .......... (1)
	
(a) (x, y) = (4, 6) 
	
∴ From (1), we get  4 = x1 + 3, 6 = 
y1 + 2
	
∴ x' = 1 and y' = 4. 
 
New co-ordinates of A are (1, 4)
	
(ii) (x, y) = ( 2,-5)
    from (1), we get 2 = x' + 3, −5 = y' + 2
	
∴ x' = −1 and y' = −7. New co-ordinates of 
	
B are (−1,−7)
Ex. 2) The origin is shifted to the point 
(−2, 1), the axes being parallel to the original 
axes. If the new co-ordinates of point A are 
(7, −4), find the old co-ordinates of point A.
Solution : We have (h, k) = (−2, 1) and if 
new co-ordinates are (X,Y). 
	
x = X + h, y = Y + k 
 
∴ x = X − 2, y = Y +1  
	
(X, Y) = (7, −4) 
we get x = 7 − 2 = 5,  y = −4 + 1 = − 3.  
 
∴ Old co-ordinates A are (5, −3)
Ex. 3) Obtain the new equation of the locus 
x2 − xy − 2y2 − x + 4y + 2 = 0 when the 
origin is shified to (2, 3), the directions of the 
axes remaining the same.
Solution : Here (h, k) = (2, 3) and if new 
co-ordinates are (X,Y). 
 
∴ x = X + h,  y = Y + k gives  
 
∴ x = X + 2,  y = Y + 3  
	
The given equation 
	
x2 − xy − 2y2 − x + 4y + 2 = 0 becomes
	
(X+2)2 − (X + 2)(Y + 3) − 2(Y + 3)2 − 
(X + 2) + 4(Y + 3) + 2 = 0
 
∴ X2 − XY − 2Y2 − 10Y − 8 = 0
This is the new equation of the given locus.

5.2 Straight Line : The simplest locus in a 
plane is a line. The characteristic property of 
this locus is that if we find the slope of a 
segment joining any two points on this locus, 
then the slope is constant.
	
If a line meets the X-axis in the point 
A (a, 0), then 'a' is called the X-intercept of 
the line. If it meets the Y-axis in the point 
B(0, b) then 'b' is called the Y-intercept of 
the line. 
Fig. 5.4
Remarks : 
(1) A line parallel to X-axis has no X-intercept.
(2) A line parallel to Y-axis has no Y-intercept.
Let's Think : 
 
• Can intercept of a line be zero ?
 
• Can intercept of a line be negative ?
5.1.2 Inclination of a line : The smallest angle 
made by a line with the positive direction of 
the X-axis measured in anticlockwise sense is 
called the inclination of the line. We denote 
inclination by θ. Clearly 0° ≤ θ < 180°.   
Remark : Two lines are parallel if and only 
if they have the same inclination.
	
The inclination of the X-axis and a line 
parallel to the X-axis is Zero. The inclination 
of the Y-axis and a line parallel to the Y-axis 
is 900.
5.2.2 Slope of a line : If the inclination of 
a line is θ then tanθ (if it exist) is called 
the slope of the line. We denote it by m. 
∴ m = tanθ. 
Activity : If A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2) are any  two 
points on a non-vertical line whose inclination 
is θ then verify that 
	
	
tan θ =

The slope of the Y-axis is not defined. 
Similarly the slope of a line parallel to the 
Y-axis is not defined. The slope of the X-axis 
is 0. The slope of a line parallel to the X-axis 
is also 0.
Remark : Two lines are parallel if and only 
if they have the same slope.
SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ex. 1) Find the slope of the line whose 
inclination is 60°. 
Solution : The tangent ratio of the inclination 
of a line is called the slope of the line. 
	
Inclination θ = 60°. 
	
∴ slope = tanθ = tan60° =

5.2.3 Perpendicular Lines : We know that 
the co-ordinate axes are perpendicular to each 
other. Similarly a horizontal line and a vertical 
line are perpendicular to each other. Slope of 
one of them is zero whereas the slope of the 
other one is not defined. 
Let us obtain a relation between slopes of non-
vertical lines.
Theorem : Non-vertical lines having slopes m1 
and m2 are perpendicular to each other if and 
only if m1×m2= −1.
Proof : Let α  and β be inclinations of lines 
having slopes m1 and m2. As lines are non

5.2.4 Angle between intersecting lines : 
We have obtained relation between slopes of 
lines which are perpendicualr to each other. 
If given lines are not perpendicular to each 
other then how to find angle between them? 
Let us derive formula to find the acute angle 
between intersecting lines. 
Theorem : If θ is the acute angle between 
non-vertical lines having slopes m1 and m2 then 
              
          tanθ =

   Fig. 5.7	
	
    Fig. 5.8
∴ tanα = m1 and  tanβ = m2    
From Fig. 5.7 and 5.8, we observe that 
θ = β − α or θ = π − (β − α)                
∴ tanθ = tan(β − α) or tanθ = tan{π−(β − α)}

∴ tanθ = |tan(β − α)| = |tan(α − β)|

5.3 Equation of line in standard forms : An 
equation in x and y which is satisfied by the 
co-ordinates of all points on a line and no 
other points is called the equation of the line.
The y co-ordinate of every point on the X-axis 
is 0 and this is true only for points on the 
X-axis. Therefore, the equation of the X-axis 
is y = 0 
	
The x co-ordiante of every point on the 
Y-axis is 0 and this is true only for points 
on the Y-axis. Therefore, the equation of the 
Y-axis is x = 0 .
	
The equation of any line parallel to the 
Y-axis is of the type x = k (where k is a 
constant) and the equation of any line parallel 
to the X-axis is of the type y = k. This is all 
about vertical and horizontal lines.
	
Let us obtain equations of non-vertical 
and non -horizontal lines in different forms: 
5.3.1 Point-slope Form : To find the equation 
of the line having slope m and which passes 
through the point A(x1, y1).
Fig. 5.9
Proof : Let L be the line passing through the 
point A(x1, y1) and which has slope m. 
Let P(x, y) be any point on the line L other 
than A.
Then the slope of line L = y

But the slope of line L is m. (given)
∴ y

 = m
∴ The equation of the line L is  
          (y − y1) = m  (x − x1)

110
The equation of the line having slope m 
and passing through A(x1, y1) is 
(y − y1) = m (x − x1).
Remark : In particular if the line passes 
through the origin O(0,0) and has slope m, 
then its equation is y − 0 = m (x − 0) 
      ∴ y = mx
Ex. Find the equation of the line passing 
through the point A(2, 1) and having slope −3.
Soln. : Given line passes through the point 
A(2, 1) and slope of the line is −3.
The equation of the line having slope m 
and passing through  A(x1, y1) is 
(y − y1) = m (x − x1).
The equation of the required line is 
y − 1 = −3(x − 2)
∴ y − 1 = −3x + 6
∴ 3x + y − 7 = 0
5.3.2 Slope-Intercept form : To find the 
equation of line having slope m and which 
makes intercept c on the Y-axis. 
Fig. 5.10
Proof : Let L be the line with slope m and 
which makes Y-intercept c. Line L meets the 
Y-axis in the point C(0, c).
Let P(x, y) be any point on the line other than 
C. Then the slope of the line L is
	
y
c
x
−
−0  = m (given)
∴ y

x
−
 = m                
∴ y = mx + c  
This is the equation of line L.
The equation of line having slope m and which 
makes intercept c on the Y-axis is y = mx + c.
Ex. Obtain the equation of line having slope 
3 and which makes intercept 4 on the Y-axis. 
Solution : The equation of line having slope 
m and which makes intercept c on the Y-axis 
is 
 	
y = mx + c.
 
∴ the equation of the line giving slope 3 
	
and making Y-intercept 4 is y = 3x + 4.
5.3.3 Two-points Form : To find the equation 
of line which passes through points A(x1, y1) and 
B(x2, y2).  
Fig. 5.11
Proof : A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) are the two 
given points on the line L. Let P(x, y) be 
any point on the line L, other than A and B. 
Now points A and P lie on the line L.

5.3.4 Double-Intercept form : To find the 
equation of the line which makes non-zero 
intercepts a and b on the co-ordinate axes.
Fig. 5.12
Let a be the X-intercept and b be the 
Y-intercept of line L. 
∴ Line L meets the X-axis in A(a, 0) and the 
Y-axis in B(0, b).
Let P(x, y) be any point on line L other than 
A and B.

5.3.5 Normal Form : Let L be a line and 
segment ON  be the perpendicular (normal) 
drawn from the origin to line L.
If ON = p and ray ON  makes angle α with 
the positive X −axis then to find the equation 
of line L.

An interesting property of a straight line.
Consider any straight line in a plane. 
It makes two parts of the points which are 
not on the line.
Fig. 5.14
Thus the plane is divided into 3 parts, the 
points on the line, points on one side of the 
line and points on the other side of the line.

114
If the line is given by ax+by+c = 0, then 
for all points (x1,y1) on one side of the line 
ax1+by1+c > 0 and for all points (x2,y2) on the 
other side of the line, ax2+by2+c < 0.
For example, consider the line given by 
y − 2x − 3 = 0. Points P(−2,0), Q(−2,4), 
R( 1
2 ,5) lie on one side and at each of those 
points, y − 2x − 3 > 0. The points A(0,0), 
B( 1
2 ,3), C(8,4) lie on the other side of the line 
and at each of those points y − 2x − 3 < 0.
Activity : 
Draw the straight lines given by 2y + x 
= 5, x = 1, 6y − x + 1 = 0 give 4 points on 
each side of the lines and check the property 
stated above.

Let's Remember
 
•  Locus : A set of points in a plane which 
satisfy certain geometrical condition (or 
conditions) is called a locus.
•  Equation of Locus : Every point in 
XY plane has Cartesian co-ordinates. An 
equation which is satisfied by co-ordinates 
of all points on the locus and which is  not 
satisfied by the co-ordinates of any point 
which does not lie on the locus is called 
the equation of the locus.
•  Inclination of a line : The smallest angle 
θ made by a line with the positive direction 
of the  X-axis, measured in anticlockwise 
sense, is called the inclination of the line. 
Clearly 0° ≤ θ ≤ 180°.
•  Slope of a line : If θ is the inclination of 
a line then tanθ (if it exist) is called the 
slope of the line.

Let's Recall

Properties of chords and tangents of a circle.

The angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right
angle.

Product of slopes of perpendicular lines is -1.

Slopes of parallel lines are equal.
A circle is a set of all points in a plane 
which are equidistant from a fixed point in the 
plane.
The fixed point is called the centre of the 
circle and the distance from the centre to any 
point on the circle is called the radius of the circle.
6.1 Different forms of equation of a circle
(1)	 Standard form : In Fig. 6.1, the origin, O
is the centre of the 
circle. P(x, y) is any 
point on the circle. 
Fig. 6.1

128
That is, (x - x1)(x - x2) + (y - y1) (y - y2) = 0    
This is called the diameter form of the equation 
of circle, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are endpoints 
of diameter of the circle.
SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ex.1 Find the equation of a circle with centre at 
	
	 origin and radius 3.
Solution : Standard equation of a circle is
	
	 x2 + y2 = r2 	
here r = 3
∴	 	 x2  + y2  = 32  	
	
	 x2 + y2 = 9      is the equation of circle
Ex.2	Find the equation of a circle whose centre is 
(−3, 1) and which pass through the point (5, 2).
Solution : Centre C = (−3, 1), 
Circle passes through the point P(5, 2). 
	
	 By distance formula,
	
	 r2 = CP2 = (5 + 3)2 + (2 − 1)2 
	
	 	
       = 82 + 12 = 64 + 1 = 65
∴	 the equation of the circle is 
	
(x + 3)2 + (y − 1)2 = 65   (centre-radius form)
	
x2 + 6x + 9 + y2 − 2y + 1 = 65
	
x2 + y2 + 6x − 2y + 10 − 65 = 0
	
x2 + y2 + 6x − 2y − 55 = 0
Ex.3	Find  the  equation  of  the  circle  with  A(2, −3) 
and B(−3, 5) as end points of its diameter.
Solution : By using the diameter form; 
	
	 A (2, -3) ≡ (x1, y1) and B(-3, 5) ≡ (x2, y2) are 
the co-ordinates of the end points of a diameter of 
the circle. 
∴ by the diameter form, equation of the circle is  
	
(x − x1) (x − x2)  + (y − y1)  (y − y2) = 0	
	
∴ (x - 2) (x + 3) + (y + 3) (y - 5) = 0
	
∴ x2 + x - 6 + y2 - 2y - 15 = 0
	
	 ∴  x2 + y2 + x - 2y - 21 = 0 
Ex.4 Find the equation of circle touching the 
	
	 Y-axis at point (0, 3) and whose Centre is 
	
	 at (-3, 3).
Solution :
The circle touches 
the Y-axis at point 
(0,3), and the centre 
is (−3,3) we get 
radius r = 3
By 
using 
centre 
radius form;
(x − h)2 + (y − k)2 = r2
(x + 3)2 + (y - 3)2 = 9
x2 + 6x + 9 + y2 − 6y  + 9 = 9
∴  x2 + y2 + 6x - 6y + 9 = 0 is the equation 
of the circle.
Ex.5 Find the equation of the circle whose centre 
is at (3,−4) and the line 3x−4y−5 = 0 cuts the circle 
at A and B; where l(AB) = 6.
Solution : centre of the 
circle C(h,k) = C(3,−4)
3x − 4y − 5 = 0 cuts the 
circle at A and B.
l(AB) = 6

6.2 General equation of a circle :
The general equation of a circle is of the 
form x2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, if g2 + f 2−c>0
The centre-radius form of equation of a circle 
is
	
(x − h)2 + (y − k)2 = r2
i.e	 x2 − 2hx + h2 + y2 − 2ky + k2 = r2
i.e	 x2 + y2 − 2hx − 2ky + (h2 + k2 − r2) = 0
	
If this is the same as equation x2 + y2 + 2gx + 
2fy + c = 0, then comparing the coefficients
2g = - 2h, 2f = - 2k and c = h2 + k2 - r2.
∴ (h, k) ≡ (-g, -f) is the center and   
r2 = h2 + k2 - c i.e. r = 
g
f

c

 is the radius.

Thus,
the general equation of a circle is
x2 + y2 + 2g x + 2 fy + c = 0 whose centre is 
(-g, -f) and radius is 
g

Activity :       
Consider the general equation of a circle 
x2 + y2 + 2gx + 2 fy + c = 0
x2 + 2gx + 
 + y2 + 2 fy + 
 = 
 + 
 - c 
∴ (x + 
 )2 + (y + 
 )2 = g2 + f 2 - c.
∴ [x - (  )]2 + [y - (  )]2 = (    )2 
(use centre radius form of equation of the circle).
Therefore centre of the circle is (-g, -f ) and radius 
is

Let's Remember
(1)	 If g2 + f 2 − c > 0, the equation 
	
x2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 represents a circle 
in the xy plane.
(2)	 If g2 + f 2 − c = 0, then the equation 
	
x2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 represents a point 
which is true degenerate conic and is the 
limiting position (radius is 0).
(3)	 If g2 + f 2 − c < 0, then the equation 
	
x2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 does not represent 
	any point in the xy plane.
Activity :
	
	 Check whether the following equations 
represent a circle. If, so then find its centre and 
radius.
	
a) 	 x2 + y2 - 6x - 4y + 9 = 0
	
b) 	 x2 + y2 − 8x + 6y + 29 = 0
	
c)		 x2 + y2 + 7x - 5y + 15 = 0
Lets Note :
The general equation of a circle is a second degree 
equation in x and y, coefficient of xy is zero, 
coefficient of x2 = coefficient of y2

Let the centre of the

∴ r = CP = CQ = CR

Consider CP = CQ	
	
	
∴ CP2 = CQ2
	
By using distance formula,
	
(h − 5)2 + (k + 6)2 = (h − 1)2 + (k − 2)2
	
∴ h2 − 10h + 25 + k2 + 12k + 36
	
 = h2 − 2h + 1 + k2 − 4k + 4
	
i.e −8h + 16k = −56
	
h - 2k = 7	
	
	 	
........ (I)
	
Now consider, CQ = CR		     ∴  CQ2 = CR2
	
(h − 1)2 + (k − 2)2 = (h − 3)2 + (k + 4)2
	
∴ h2 − 2h + 1 + k2 − 4k + 4
	
= h2 − 6h + 9 + k2 + 8k + 16
	
i.e. 4h − 12k = 20	
∴ h − 3k = 5 ......... (II)
	
Now, subtracting (II) from I, we get,
	
k = 2
	
Substituting k = 2 in (II) we get 
	
h = 11	       ∴  C = (11, 2)

	 	 ∴	          x2 + y2 − 22x - 4y + 25 = 0 
Ex. 3) 	Show that the points (5, 5), (6, 4), (−2, 4) 
and  (7, 1) are on the same circle; i.e. these 
points are concyclic.
Solution : 
	
Let, the equation of the circle be
	
x2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0		
....... (I)
	
The circle passing through (5, 5), (6, 4), 
(−2, 4)
	
 ∴    50 + 10g + 10f + c = 0	
....... (II)
	
 ∴    52 + 12g + 8f + c = 0		
....... (III)
	
∴	   20 − 4g + 8f + c = 0		 	
....... (IV)
	
Now (III) − (IV) gives	
32 + 16g = 0
	
∴ 16g = −32	
∴ g = -2
	
Subtracting (II) from (III)
	
 we get 2 + 2g − 2f = 0 	 	 	
   ..... (V)
	
substitute g = -2 in equation (V) 
	
2 + (-4) - 2f = 0	
2 - 4 = 2f	 ∴  f = -1
	
Now substitute g = −2 and f = −1 in eqn. (IV)
	
20 + c = 4(-2) - 8(1) = −8 + 8
	
20 + c = 0	
∴ c = -20
	
Now substituting g = −2, f = -1 and c = -20 in 
	
equation (I) we get,
	
x2 + y2 − 4x −2y - 20 = 0 .... (VI) is the 
equation of the circle passing through the 
points (5,5), (6,4) and (−2,4).
	
If (7,1) satisfies equation (VI), the four points 
are concyclic.
	
L.H.S.	 = (7)2 + (1)2 − 28 − 2 − 20
	
	 	 	  = 49 + 1 − 50 = 0 = R.H.S.
	
∴ Thus, the point (7, 1) satisfies the equation of

6.3 Parametric Form of a circle :
Let P(x, y) be any 
point on a circle 
with centre at O 
and radius r.
As shown in 
Fig. 6.7, OP makes 
an angle θ with the 
positive 
direction 
of X-axis. Draw 
PM ⊥ X-axis from P.
∆ OMP is a right angled triangle,
∴ cos θ = 
OM
OP  = 
x
r  ;	
sin θ = 
PM
OP  = 
y
r
	
∴  x = r cos θ 	
∴  y = r sin θ
x = r cos θ and y =  r sin θ is the parametric form 
of circle x2 + y2 = r2. θ is called parameter.
Note that:
(1)	The parametric form of circle 
	
(x − h)2 + (y − k)2 = r2 is given by
	
x = h + r cos θ and y = k + r sin θ.
	
Hence co-ordinates of any point on the circle 
	
are (h + r cos θ , k + r sin θ). 
(2)	Sometimes  parametric  form  is  more  convenient  
for calculation as it contains only one variable.
6.3.1 Tangent : When a line intersects a circle in 
coincident points, then that line is called as a 
tangent of the circle and the point of intersection 
is called point of contact.
	
The equation of tangent to a standard circle 
x2 + y2 = r2  at point  P(x1, y1) on it.
	
Given equation of a  circle  is x2 + y2 = r2. The 
centre of the circle is at origin O(0, 0) and radius is r. 
Let P (x1, y1) be any point on the circle.

As (x1, y1) lies on the circle, x1

therefore equation (I) becomes  xx1 + yy1 = r2
	 Thus, In general, equation of the tangent to a 
circle x2 + y2 = r2 at point P(x1, y1) is xx1+yy1= r2

(x1, y1) replace x2 by x x1, 2x by (x + x1), y2  by y

Equation of tangent in parametric form.
Substituting rcosθ1 for x1 and rsinθ1, foy y1, the 
equation of a tangent to the circle x2 + y2 = r2 at 
point P (r cos θ1, r sin θ1) = (x1,y1) is
x.r cos θ1 + y.r sin θ1 = r2  i.e. x cos θ1 + y sin θ1 = r
6.3.2  Condition of tangency :
	
To find the condition that a line y = mx + c is 
a tangent to the circle x2 + y2 = a2 and also to find 
the point of contact,
	
Let the equation of the line be y = mx + c 
	
\ mx - y + c = 0       ..........(I)
	
Equation of a tangent to the circle x2 + y2 = a2 
at point (x1 y1) on it is xx1 + yy1 = a2 
	
i.e. x1 x + y1 y - a2 = 0    .............(II)
	
If the line given by equation (I) is tangent 
to the circle then equation (I) and equation (II) 
represent the same (tangent) line.
	
Comparing the co-efficients of the like terms 
in these equations,
	
x1

∴

∴ x1 = -a2m

 and y1 = a2

To check the tangency of a straight line to a

6.3.3 Tangents from a point to the circle
From any point outside the circle and in the 
same plane, two tangents can be drawn to the 
circle. 
Let P(x1,y1) be a point in the plane, outside 
the circle. 
If a tangent from P to the circle has slope 
m, the equation of the tangent is y−y1 = m(x−x1) 
i.e. mx−y1−mx1+y1 = 0.

∴ (x1

quadratic equation in m.	
	
It has two roots say m1 and m2, which are the 
slopes of two tangents.
	
Thus two tangents can be drawn to a circle 
from a given point in its plane.

Which represents a circle and is called as

x2

(x − 3)2 + (y + 2)2 = 16
	
(x − 3)2 + (y + 2)2 = (4)2

x − 3 = 4 cos θ  and y + 2 = 4 sin θ
	
that is, x = 3 + 4 cos θ  and y = −2 + 4 sinθ

Introduction:
The 
Greek 
mathematician Archimedes 
and Apollonius studied the curves named conic 
sections. These curves are intersections of a plane 
with right circular cone. Conic sections have

constant. Then the surface generated is a double-
napped right circular cone.
The point V is called the vertex, the line l 
is called axis, and the rotating line m is called a 
generator of the cone. The vertex V separates the 
cone in to two parts called nappes (Fig.7.2). 
7.1.2. Conic sections : 
Let's construct 
Take a carrot or a cone made of drawing paper 
and cut it with a plane satisfying the following 
conditions.
i)	
The plane is perpendicular to the axis and 
does not contain vertex, the intersection is a 
circle (studied earlier Fig. 7.3(a)).
ii)	
The plane is parallel to one position of the 
generator but does not pass through the 
vertex, we get a parabola (Fig. 7.3(a)).
iii)	
The plane is oblique to the axis and not 
parallel to the generator we get an ellipse 
(Fig. 7.3(a)). 
iv)	
If a double cone is cut by a plane parallel to 
axis, we get parts of the curve at two ends 
called hyperbola (Fig. 7.3(b)).
v)	
A plane containing a generator and tangent 
to the cone, intersects the cone in that 
generator. We get pair to straight lines 
(Fig. 7.4).
7.1.3. Definition of a conic section and its 
equation:
	
A conic section or conic can be defined as 
the locus of the point P in a plane such that the 
ratio of the distance of  P from a fixed point to its 
distance from a fixed line is constant.
The fixed point is called the focus of the conic 
section, denoted by S. The fixed straight line is 
called the directrix of conic section, denoted by d.
If S is the focus, P is any point on the 
conic section and segment PM is the length of 
perpendicular from P on the directrix, then by
definition SP
PM = constant. (fig. 7.5)
This constant ratio is 
called the eccentricity of the 
conic section, denoted by e. 
Hence we write 
SP
PM  = e 
or SP = e PM. This is called 
Focus - Directrix property 
of 
the 
conic 
section.
The nature of the conic section 
depends upon the value of e.	                         
  i)	
If e = 1, the conic section is called parabola.
 ii)	
If 0 < e < 1, the conic section is called an 
ellipse. 
iii)	
If e > 1, the conic section is called 
hyperbola.	
7.1.4. Some useful terms of conic sections: 
1) 	
Axis: A line about which a conic section 
is symmetric is called an axis of the conic 
section.
2) 	
Vertex : The point of intersection of a conic 
section with its axis of symmetry is called a 
vertex.
3) 	
Focal Distance : The distance of a point on 
a conic section from the focus is called the 
focal distance of the point.
4) 	
Focal chord : A chord of a conic section 
passing through its focus is called a focal 
chord.
5) 	
Latus-Rectum: A focal chord of a conic 
section which is perpendicular to the axis of 
symmetry is called the latus-rectum.
6)	
Centre of a conic : The point which bisects 
every chord of the conic passing through it, 
is called the centre of the conic.
7)	
Double ordinate : A chord passing through 
any point on the conic and perpendicular to 
the axis is called double ordinate.

7.1.5.	Parabola 
Definition: A parabola is the locus of the point 
in plane equidistant from a fixed point and a 
fixed line in that plane. The fixed point is called 
the focus and the fixed straight line is called 
the directrix. 
Standard equation of the parabola:
Equation of the parabola in the standard form 
y2 = 4ax. 
Let S be the focus and d be the directrix of the 
parabola.
Let 
SZ 
be 
p e r p e n d i c u l a r 
to the directrix. 
Bisect 
SZ 
at 
the point O. By 
the 
definition 
of  parabola the 
midpoint 
O 
is 
on the parabola. 
Take O as the 
origin, line OS as 
the X - axis and the line through O perpendicular 
to OS as the Y - axis.
Let SZ = 2 a, a > 0. 
Then the coordinates of the focus S are (a, 0) and 
the coordinates of Z are (-a, 0).
The equation of the directrix d  is 
x = -a, i.e. x + a = 0
Let P (x, y) be any point on the parabola. Draw 
segment PM perpendicular to the directrix d. 
∴ M= (- a , y)

Squaring both sides   (x - a )2 +  y2  = (x + a)2 
that is   x2 - 2ax + a2 + y2 = x2 + 2ax + a2 
that is   y2 = 4 ax  (a > 0)
This is the equation of parabola in standard form.
Activity :
	
Trace the parabola using focus directrix 
property.
1)	
find the equation of parabola with focus at 
(2, 0) and directrix  x + 2 = 0.
2)	
Find the equation of parabola with focus at 
(- 4 , 0) and directrix  x = 4.
7.1.6. Tracing of the parabola y2 = 4 ax (a>0) 
1) 	 Symmetry : Equation of the parabola can 
be written as y = ± 2
ax   that is for every 
value of x, there are two values of y which 
are negatives of each other. Hence parabola 
is symmetric about X- axis.
2) 	 Region : For every x < 0,the value of y is 
imaginary therefore entire part of the curve 
lies to the right of Y-axis.
3) 	 Intersection with the axes: For x = 0 we have 
y = 0, therefore the curve meets the co 
ordinate axes at the origin O(0, 0)
4) 	 Shape of parabola: As x →  ∞, y →  ∞.  
Therefore the curve extends to infinity as x 
grows large and opens in the right half plane
	
Shape of the parabola y2 = 4 ax (a > 0) is as 
shown in figure 7.6.

y2 = 4 ax

Length of latus-Rectum:
In figure 7.7 LSL' is the latus-rectum of the 
parabola y2 = 4 ax. By symmetry of the curve 
LS = L'S  = l (say).
So the coordinates of L are (a , l)
Since L lies on y2 = 4 ax, l2 = 4a (a)
	
	
	
l2 = 4a2
	
	
	
l = ±2a
As L is in the first quadrant,	
 l > 0 
	
	
	
	
	
l = 2a
Length of latus rectum LSL' = 2l = 2(2a) 
= 4a

rectum are L (a, 2a) and L' (a,−2a)

coordinates of end points of latus rectum of 
each of the following parabolas.
	
i) y2  =  28x	
	
	
ii) 3x2  =  8y
Solution:
	
i) y2  =  28x
Equation of the parabola is y2  = 28x 
comparing this equation with y2  =  4ax, we get 
4a = 28 ∴ a = 7
Coordinates of the focus are S(a,0) = (7,0) 

145
Equation of the directrix is x + a = 0 that is 
x + 7 = 0
Length of latus rectum = 4a = 4 × 7 = 28
End points of latus rectum are (a,2a) and 
(a,-2a). that is (7,14) and (7, -14)
	
ii) 3x2  =  8y
Equation of the parabola is 3x2  =  8y that is
x2  = 8
3 y  
comparing this equation with x2  =  4by, we
get 4b = 8
3 ∴ b = 2

Co-ordinates of the focus are S (0, b) = 
(0, 2
3 )
Equation of the directrix is y + b = 0 that is 
y + 2
3  = 0 that is 3y + 2 = 0
Length of latus rectum = 4b = 4 × 2

Coordinates of end points of latus rectum are
(2b, b) and (−2b, b). that is ( 4

3 )
Ex. 2) Find the equation of the parabola with 
vertex at the origin, axis along Y-axis and 
passing through the point (6,-3)
Solution: 
The vertex of the parabola is at the origin, 
it's axis is along Y-axis. Hence equation of the 
parabola is of the form  x2  =  4by.
Now the point (6,−3) lies on this parabola. 
Hence the coordinates of the points satisfy the 
equation of the parabola. 
∴ (6) 2 = 4 b × - 3)
∴ -12 b = 36   ∴  b = - 3
∴ equation of  parabola is   x2  =  4(-3)y
x2  =  -12y that is x2  + 12y = 0.
Ex. 3) Find the equation of the parabola whose 
diretrix is x + 3 = 0
Solution: 
Here equation of diretrixs  is x + a = 0 that 
is x + 3 = 0 comparing  we get 	a = 3.
∴ Equation of the parabola y2  =  4ax that is 
y2  =  12x.
Ex. 4) Calculate the focal distance of point P on 
the parabola y2  = 20x whose ordinate is 10
Solution : Equation of parabola is y2  = 20x 
comparing this with y2  =  4ax 
we get	 4a = 20 ∴ a = 5
Here ordinate = y - coordinate = 10
∴ (10)2 = 20 x        ∴ 20x = 100     
∴ x = 100
20  = 5
Now focal distance = a + x 
	
	
        = a + abscissa of point
	
	
         = 5 + 5 = 10 units
Ex. 5) Find the equation of the parabola having 
(4,−8) as one of extremities of porabola.
Solution : Given that, one of the extrimities 
of the latus rectum of the parabola is 
(4, −8) therefore other must be (4,8). 
End-coordinates of latus - rectum (a, ± 2a) = 
(4, ±8). 
	
∴ a = 4
	
Equation of parabola is y2 = 4ax 
	
	
y2 = 4(4)x  ∴ y2 = 16x 

146
Ex. 6) For the parabola 3y2 =16x, find the 
parameter of the point  (3,−4)
Solution : Equation of  parabola is 3y2 =16x 
∴ y2  = 16
3 x comparing this with y2  = 4ax we get 
4a = 16
3  ∴ a = 4

Ex. 7) Find the coordinates of the  vertex and 
focus, the equation of the axis of symmetry, 
diretrix and tangent at the vertex of the 
parabola x2 +4x + 4y + 16 = 0
	
Solution : Equation of  parabola is 
	
x2 + 4x + 4y + 16 = 0
x2 + 4x = - 4y - 16
x2 + 4x + 4 =  - 4y - 12 
(x+2)2 = - 4  (y+3)
Comparing this equation with X2  = -4bY
We get X = x + 2 , Y = y + 3 and  4b = -4	
 ∴ b = -1
Coordinates of the vertex are X = 0 and 
Y = 0 that is x + 2 = 0 and y + 3 = 0
∴ x = -2 and y = -3
∴ Vertex = (x, y) = (-2,-3)
Coordinates of focus are given by X = 0 and 
Y = + b 
that is  x + 2  = 0    and  y + 3  = - 1 
∴  x = - 2  and y = -4
∴ Focus = (-2, -4)
Equation of axis is  X = 0 that is x + 2 = 0
Equation of diretrix is Y + b = 0 that is 
y + 3 - 1 = 0 that is   y + 2 = 0
Equation of tangent at vertex is Y = 0 that 
is y + 3 = 0
7.1.11	Tangent : 
A straight line which intersects the parabola in 
coinsident point is called a tangent of the parabola
Fig. 7.11
     
	
Point Q moves along the curve to the point 
P. The limiting position of secant PQ is the tangent 
at P.
	
A tangent to the curve is the limiting 
position of a secant intersecting the curve in 
two points and moving so that those points of 
intersection come closer and finally coincide.
Tangent at a point on a parabola.
Let us find the equation of tangent to the 
parabola at a point on it in cartesion form and in 
parametrics form.	
We find the equation of tangent to the 
parabola y2 = 4ax at the point P(x1, y1) on it. Hence, 
obtain the equation of tangent at P(t).
	
Equation of the tangent to the curve y = f(x) 
at point (x1 y1) on it is,
	
y - y1 = [f  (x)](x1, y1) (x - x1) [f  (x)](x1, y1)
We need to know the slope of the tangent at 
P(x1, y1). From the theory of derivative of a function,
the slope of the tangent is dy
dx  at (x1, y1)

147
and here  dy
dx
(x1, y1)
 = 2

y
The equation of parabola is y2 = 4ax,  differentiate 
both sides with respect to x 
We get   2y dy
dx = 4a (1) 
∴ dy
dx  = 2a
y
∴ dy
dx
(x1, y1)
 =

y
 = slope of the tangent at P(x1,y1) 
∴ Equation of the tangent at P(x1, y1) is 
y - y1 = 
2a
y1  (x - x1) 
yy1 - y1
2
  =  2a (x - x1) 
yy1 - y1
2
 = 2ax - 2ax1
Now P(x1,y1) lies on the parabola ∴ y1
2 = 4ax1
∴ yy1 - 4ax1 = 2ax - 2ax1
∴ yy1 = 2ax + 2ax1
∴ yy1 = 2a (x + x1)     ......................(I)
This is the equation of the tangent at  P(x1,y1) on it
Now, t1 is the parameter of point P
∴ P(x1,y1) = (at1
2, 2at1) that is x1  = at1
2, y1  = 2at1 
Substituting these values in equation (1), we get  
y(2at1) = 2a (x + at1
2) 
that is      y t1 = x + a t1
2 
This is the required equation of the tangent at  P(t).
Thus, the equation of tangent to the parabola 
y2 = 4ax at point (x,y) on it is yy1 = 2a(x +x1) or 
yt1 = x + at1
2 where t1 is the parameter.
7.1.12 Condition of tangency 
To find the condition that the line y = mx + c 
is tangent to the parabola y2 = 4ax. Also to find the 
point of contact.
Equation of the line is y = mx + c  
∴ mx - y + c = 0 .......................(I)
equation of the tangent at  P(x1,y1) to the parabola 
y2 = 4ax is  yy1  =  2a (x + x1) 
∴  2 a x - y1 y  + 2a x1 = 0 .................(II)
If the line given by equation (I) is a tangent to the 
parabola at (x1,y1). Equation (I) and equation (II) 
represents the same line.
Comparing the co-efficients of like terms in 
equations (I) and (II)
we get 2a
m  =  −

y1

∴ x1  = c

But the point P(x1,y1) lies on the parabola   
∴  y1

∴ ( 2a

m )

∴ c = a

7.1.13	Tangents from a point to a parabola
In general, two tangents can be drawn to a 
parabola y2  = 4ax from any point in its plane. 
Let P  (x1,y1) be any point in the plane of parabola.
Equation of tangent to the parabola y2  = 4ax is 
y = mx + a
m  
Since the tangent passes through P (x1,y1), we 
have  y1 = mx1+ a
m  
∴ my1= m2x1+a
m2x1 - my1 + a = 0 ................................(1)
x1m2 - y1 m + a = 0

148
This is quadratic equation in m and in general it 
has two roots say, m1 and m2 which are the slopes 
of two tangents.
Thus, in general, two tangents can been drawn to 
a parabola from a given point in its plane.
If the tangent drawn from P are mutually 
perpendicular we have 
m1 m2  =  -1
From equation (1)  m1 m2  = a
x1
 (product of roots)
∴  a
x1
 = -1
∴ x1 = -a
which is the equation of directrix.
Thus, the locus of the point, the tangents from 
which to the parabola are perpendicular to each 
other is the directrix of the parabola.

y2 = 9x at (1,−3).

comparing it with y2 = 4ax
4a = 9    ⇒    a = 9

Tangent is drawn to the parabola at (1,−3) = (x1,y1)
Equation of tangent to the parabola y2 = 4ax at 
(x1,y1) is yy1 = 2a(x + x1)

Ex. 2) Find the equation to tangent to the parabola 
y2 = 12x from the point (2,5).
Solution :
Equation of the parabola is y2 = 12x
comparing it with y2 = 4ax ⇒ 4a = 12 
∴ a = 3
Tangents are drawn to the parabola from the 
point (2,5).

(2m − 3) (m − 1) = 0
m = 3
2     or   m = 1
These are the slopes of tangents.
Therefore the equations of tangents by slope 
- point form are
(y − 5) = 3
2  (x − 2)   and   (y − 5) = 1 (x − 2)
∴ 2y − 10 = 3x − 6 and   y − 5 = x − 2
∴ 3x − 2y + 4  = 0  and  x − y + 3 = 0
Ex. 3) Show that the tangents drawn from the 
point (−4,−9) to the parabola y2 = 16x are 
perpendicular to each other.
Solution :
Equation of the parabola is y2 = 16x.
comparing it with y2 = 4ax  ⇒  4a = 16 
∴ a = 4
Tangents are drawn to the parabola from 
point (−4,−9).

An ellipse is the locus of a point in a plane 
which moves so that its distance from a fixed 
point bears a constant ratio e ( 0 < e < 1 ) to its 
distance from a fixed line. The fixed point is 
called the focus S and the fixed line is called 
the directrix d.
Let S be the focus, d be the directrix and e be the 
eccentricity of an ellipse. 
Draw SZ perpendicular to directrix. let A and 
A' divide the segment SZ internally as well as 
externally in the ratio e : 1.

axis and minor axis together are called 
principal axis of the ellipse. In the standard 
form X axis is the major axis and Y axis is 
the minor axis.
iii)  	 The segment AA' of length 2a is called the 
major axis and the segment BB' of length 2b 
is called the minor axis. Ellipse is symmetric 
about both the axes.
iv) 	 The origin O bisects every chord through it 
therefore origin O is called the centre of the 
ellipse.
v) 	
latus rectum is the chord through focus 
which is perpendicular to major axis. It is 
bisected at the focus. There are two latera 
recta as there are two foci.

Sum of focal distances of point on the ellipse 
is the length of major axis which is a constant.
Using this property one can define and draw 
an ellipse. If S1 and S2 are two fixed points and a 
point P moves in the plane such that PS1 + PS2 is 
equal to constant K , where K > d(S1S2) , then the 
locus of P is an ellipse with S1 and S2 as foci. Here 
in the standard form K = 2a.
5)	
A circle drawn with the major axis AA′ as a 
diameter is called an auxiliary circle of the 
ellipse.

be a point on the on the auxiliary circle such that 
QPN ⊥ to the major axis. 
Let m ∠ XOQ = θ  ∴ Q = (a cosθ, a sinθ)
Let   P(x , y) ≡ (a cos θ, y).

auxillary circle and director circle of the 
hyperbola.
The hyperbola is the intersection of double 
napped cone with plane parallel to the axis.
The hyperbola is the locus of a point in 
a plane which moves so that its distance from 
a fixed point bears a constant ratio e (e > 1) to 
its distance from a fixed line. The fixed point is 
called the focus S and the fixed line is called the 
directrix d.
Fig. 7.24
If S is the focus and d is the directrix not 
containing the focus and P is the moving point, 
then PS
PM
 = e, where PM is the perpendicular
on the directrix.  e > 1 called eccentricity of the 
hyperbola. (Fig. 7.24)
7.3.1 Standard equation of the hyperbola
Let S be the focus, d be the directrix and e be the 
eccentricity of a hyperbola. 
Draw SZ perpendicular to directrix. Let A and A' 
divide the segment SZ internally and externally in 
the ratio e : 1. By definition of hyperbola A and A' 
lie on hyperbola.
Let AA' = 2 a , midpoint O of segment AA' be the 
origin. Then O ≡ (0,0) , A≡ (a,0) and A' ≡ (− a,0)

Let S' be (− ae,0) and d' be the line x = − a

For any point P on the hyperbola, PM' is per­
pendicular on d' then it can be verified that 
PS '= e PM'. 
    Thus for the hyperbola ( a e , 0 ) and  ( − a e , 0 )
are two focii and x = a

corresponding two directrices.

7.3.2 Some useful terms of the hyperbola
Equation of the hyperbola 
 
i)	
The hyperbola intersects x-axis at A(a, 0), 
A′ (−a, 0).
ii)	 It does not intersects the y-axis.
iii)  The segment AA′ of length 2a is called the 
transverse axis and the segment BB′ of length 
2b is called the conjugate axis. 
iii) The line segment through the foci of the 
hyperbola is called the transverse axis and the 
line segment through centre and perpendicular 
to transverse axis is the conjugate axis. The 
transverse axis and conjugate axis together 
are called principal axes of the hyperbola. 
In the standard form X axis is the transverse 
axis and Y axis is the conjugate axis.

166
iv) latus rectum is the chord passing through the 
focus which is perpendicular to transverse 
axis. It is bisected at the focus. There are two 
latera recta as there are two focii.
7.3.3 Some Results :
1)	
Distance between directrices i.e. d (dd′) is the 
same that of distance ZZ′ ie. d (ZZ′)

SP and S′P are the focal distances of the point

Let P(x1 y) be any point on the hyperbola. Draw 
PM perpendicular to OX. Draw the tangent MQ 
touching auxiliary circle at Q. Point Q is called the 
corresponding point of P on the auxiliary circle.
Let m∠XOQ = θ. Then by trigonometry 
co-ordinates of Q are (a cos θ, a sinθ).
Further,
x = OM = OM
OQ . OQ = secθ. a = a sec θ
The point P(x,y) = P(a sec θ, y) ∴ P lies on the 
hyperbola-(I) therefore.

Since P lies in the first quadrant and angle 
θ < 90°, y and tanθ both are positive. 
∴ y = b tanθ
∴ P ≡ P (a secθ, b tanθ)

Let us denote this point by P(θ) = P (a secθ, 
b tanθ) where θ is called parameter also called the 
eccentric angle of point P.
The equations x = a secθ, y = b tan θ are called 
parametric equations of the hyperbola.

to obtain the equation of tangent at P(θ1).

7.3.6 Tangents from a point to the hyperbola
Two tangents can be drawn to a hyperbola from 
any point outside the hyperbola in its plane.

The equation of tangent to the hyperbola  is 
y = m x ±

quadratic equation in m which is found to be,

2 + b2) = 0
it has two roots say, m1 and m2  which are the 
slopes of two tangents.

hyperbola from a given point in its plane.

7.3.8 Auxiliary Circle, Director Circle
	
The director circle of the given hyperbola is 
the locus of a point, the tangents from which to 
the hyperbola are at right angles.

For the standard hyperbola x2
a2  - y2
b2  = 1, the 
circle drawn with transverse axis as a diameter is 
called the auxillary circle of the hyperbola and its 
equation is x2 + y2 = a2 .
	
The locus of point of intersection of perpen­
dicular tangents to the hyperbola x2

b2  = 1 is 
called the director circle of the hyperbola and its 
equation is x2 + y2 = a2 - b2 . (a > b) .

director circle x2 + y2 = 16 of the

Consider the point P moving along the line so that 
distance OP goes on increasing, then the distance 
between P and hyperbola goes on decreasing but 
does not become zero. Here the distance between 
the point P and hyperbola is tending to zero, 
such a straight line is called an asymptote for the 
hyperbola

SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ex.1 : Find the equation of the tangent to the 
hyperbola 2x2 - 3y2 = 5 at a point in the third 
quadrant whose abscissa is -2.
Solution : Let P(-2, y1) be the point on the 
hyperbola
∴ 2(-2)2 - 3y2 = 5
∴ 8 - 5 = 3y2 
∴ 3 = 3y2 
∴ y2 = 1
∴ y = ±1
But P lies in the third quadrant.
∴ P ≡ (-2, -1)

Ex. 3 : If the line 2x + y + k = 0 is tangent to the

8  = 1 then find the value of k.
Solution : The equation of the hyperbola is 
x2
6  − y2
8  = 1.
The equation of the  line is 2x + y + k = 0 
∴ y = -2x - k
Putting this value of y in the equation of hyperbo­
la, we get
x2
6  - (-2x - k)2
8
 = 1
∴ 4x2 - 3(4x2 + 4kx + k2) = 24
∴ 4x2 - 12(4x2 - 12kx - 3k2) = 24 
∴ 8x2 + 12kx + (3k2 + 24) = 0 .............(1)
Since given line touches the hyperbola
∴ the quadratic equation (1) in x has equal roots.
∴ its discriminant = 0  i.e.  b2 − 4ac = 0
∴ (12k)2 - 4(8) (3k2 + 24) = 0
∴ 144k2 - 32(3k2 + 24) = 0
∴ 9k2 - 2(3k2 + 24) = 0
∴ 9k2 - 6k2 - 48 = 0
∴ 3k2 = 48 
∴ k2 = 16
∴ k2 = ±4

174
Another Method :
Here c = - k, m = - 2, a2 = b, b2 = 8
∴ c2 = a2m2 - b2 
∴ k2 = [(-2)2 , 6] = 8
∴ k2 = 16
∴ k2 = ± 4
Ex.4 : The line x - y + 3 = 0 touches the hyperbola 
whose foci are (

the hyperbola.
Solution : Let the equation of the hyperbola be
.................(1)
Its foci (±ae, 0) are (
,
)
± 41 0
∴ ae = 
41
∴ a2 e2 = 41
∴ a2 + b2 = 41..............(2)   (a2e2 = a2+b2)
The given line is y = x + 3
Comparing this with y = mx + c, we get
m = 1, c = 3
Since the given line touches the hyperbola
∴ It satisfies the condition of tangency.
∴ a2m2 - b2 = c2 
∴ a2(1)2 - b2 = (3)2 
∴ a2 - b2 = 9...................(3)
By adding (2) and (3), we get
2a2 = 50  ∴ a2 = 25
from (2), we get
25 + b2 = 41 ∴ b2 = 16

Let's Remember
•	
A conic section or a conic can be defined as 
the locus of the point P in a plane such that 
the ratio of the distance of P, from a fixed 
point to its distance from a fixed line is con­
stant.
	
The constant ratio is called the eccentricity of 
the conic section, denoted by 'e'.
•	
If e = 1 the conic section is called parabola if 
0 < e < 1 the conic section is called ellipse. if 
e > 1 the conic section is called hyperbola.

∙ Meaning and Definition of Dispersion
∙ Range of data.
∙ Variance and Standard Deviation
∙ Coefficient of Variation
Let's Recall
∙ Concept of Constant and Variable
∙ Concept of an Average
∙ Computation of Mean for Ungrouped and 
Grouped Data
"An average does not tell the full story. 
It is hardly fully representative of a mass unless 
we know the manner in which the individual items 
scatter around it. A further description of the se­
ries is necessary if we are to gauge how represen­
tative the average is."	
	
	
	
	
	
	
           -  George Simpson and Fritz Kafka
Let's Observe 
In the earlier classes we have learnt about 
the measures of central tendency mean, median 
and mode. Such an average tells us only about 
the central part of the data. But it does not give 
any information about the spread of the data. For 
example, consider the runs scored by 3 batsmen 
in a series of 5 One Day International matches.
Batsman

Z

All the above series have the same size 
(n=5) and the same mean (50), but they are 
different in composition. Thus, to decide who 
is more dependable, the measure of mean is not 
sufficient. The spread of data or variation is a 
factor which needs our attention. To understand 
more about this we need some other measure. 
One such measure is Dispersion.
In the above example, observations from 
series X and series Z are more scattered as 
compared to those in series Y. So Y is more 
consistent. The extent of scatter in observations 
which deviate from mean is called dispersion. 
Activity : 
Given two different series-
	
	
A : 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 4, 8
	
	
B : 2, 2.2, 2.6, 3.4, 3.8, 
Find arithmetic means of the two series.
Plot the two series on the number line. 
	
Observe the scatter of the data in each series 
and decide which series is more scattered.
Let's Learn
According to Spiegel:
 	 "The degree to which numerical data tend 
to spread about an average value is called the 
variation or dispersion of the data."	
8.1	 Measures of  Dispersion :
Following measures of dispersion are the 
commonly used -
(i)	 Range 
(ii)	 Variance
(iii)	Standard deviation

Measures of Dispersion

180
8.1.1 Range :
Range is the simplest measure of dispersion. 
It is defined as the difference between the largest 
value and the smallest value in the data.
Thus, Range = Largest Value - Smallest Value 
	
	
          = L -S 
Where, L = Largest Value and S = Smallest 
Value.
Uses of Range:
1)	 It is used in stock market.
2)	 It is used in calculations of mean temperature 
of a certain place. 	
	
	
	
	
SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ex.1)	Following data gives weights of 10 
students (in kgs) in a certain school. Find 
the range of     the data.
	
	 70, 62, 38, 55, 43, 73, 36, 58, 65, 47 
Solution : Smallest Value = S = 36
	
	 	      Largest Value  = L = 73
                  Range = L - S = 73 - 36 = 37
Ex.2. Calculate range for the following data.

∴ Range = L - S = 150 - 30 = 120

8.2 	 VARIANCE and STANDARD DEVIATION:
The main drawback of the range is that it is 
based on only two values, and does not consider 
all the observations. The variance and standard 
deviation overcome this drawback as they are based 
on the deviations taken from the mean.
8.2.1 Variance: 
The variance of a variable X is defined as the 
arithmetic mean of the squares of all deviations of 
X taken from its arithmetic mean.
	
It is denoted by Var(X) or σ2 .
	
Var (X) = σ2 =

grouped frequency distribution :
	
Let x1, x2,..., xn be the mid points of the 
intervals. and f1, f2, ..., fn are corresponding

8.2.3 Change of origin and scale:
1.	
The variance and consequently the standard 
deviation are independent of change of 
origin.
	
That is if d = x - A where A the class mark of 
middle class interval if the number of classes 
is odd. If the number of classes is even, then 
there will be two middle class intervals and 
A is the class mark of the one having greater 
frequency.
    	 then  σ d
2  = σ x
2    and  σd
 = σx
	
It means that if σx is standard deviation of the 
values x1, x2, x3, ... xn. The standard deviation 
σd, of x1 − A, x2−A, x3 − A, ......, xn − A is also 
same as that of σx.

2.	
The variance and consequently the standard 
deviation are not independent of change of 
scale.
	
Let u = x - A
h
 where h is width of the class 
	
interval if given. If the class intervals are not 
given, then h is the difference (or distance) 
between the two consecutive value of xi.
     	 and h ≠ 0, then σx = h σu

8.3.1 Coefficient of Variation : 
Standard deviation depends upon the unit 
of measurement. Therefore it cannot be used to 
compare two or more series expressed in different 
units. For this purpose coefficient of variation 
(C.V.) is used and is defined as,
C. V.  = 100 × σ
x   

186
Coefficient of Variation is used to compare 
the variability of two distributions. A distribution 
with smaller C.V. is said to be more homogenous 
or compact and the series with larger C.V. is said 
to be more heterogeneous. The distribution with 
smaller C.V. is said to be more consistent.
SOLVED EXAMPLES
Ex.1) The arithmetic mean of runs scored by 
3 batsmen Varad, Viraj and Akhilesh in the 
same series are 50, 52 and 21 respectively. The 
standard deviation of their runs are 11, 16 and 5 
respectively. Who is the most consistent of the 
three?  If one of the three is to be selected, who 
will be selected?
Solution :
Let x1 , x2 , x3 and σ1, σ2, σ3 be the means
and standard deviations of the three batsmen Varad, 
Viraj and Akhilesh respectively. 
Therefore, x1  = 50,  x2  = 52,  x3   = 21 and 
σ1 = 11, σ2 = 16, σ3 = 5
Now,  C. V. of runs scored by Varad = 100 × 
σ1
1x
 
= 100 × 11
50  = 22 
C. V. of runs scored by Viraj = 100 × σ 2
2x
 
= 100 × 16
52  = 30.76 
C. V. of runs scored by Akhilesh = 100 × σ 3
3x
 
= 100 × 5
21  = 23.81
(i) 	 Since the C. V. of the runs is smaller for Varad, 
he is the most consistent player.
(ii) 	 To take decision regarding the selection, let us 
consider both the C.V.s and means.
(a)	 Based on consistency : 
	
Since C.V. of Varad is smallest, he is more 
consistent and hence is to be selected.
(b)	 Based on expected score :
	
If the player with highest expected score 
(mean) is to be selected, then Viraj will be 
selected.

Therefore  σ x  =

 = 5.28
	
C.V.( Y )  = 100 ×

Since C.V.(Y)  <  C.V.(X),
	
The shares of company Y are more stable in 
value.

Let's Recall
9.1.1 Basic Terminologies
	
Random 
Experiment 
: 
Suppose 
an 
experiment having more than one outcome.
All possible results are known but the actual 
result cannot be predicted such an experiment 
is called a random experiment.
	
Outcome: A possible result of random 
experiment is called a possible outcome of the 
experiment. 
	
Sample space: The set of all possible 
outcomes of a random experiment is called the 
sample space. The sample space is denoted by 
S or Greek letter omega (Ω). The number of 
elements in S is denoted by n(S). A possible 
outcome is also called a sample point since it 
is an element in the sample space. 
	
Event: A subset of the sample space is 
called an event.
Favourable Outcome: An outcome that 
belongs to the specified event is called a 
favourable outcome.    
Types of Events:
	Elementary Event: An event consisting 
of a single outcome is called an elementary 
event. 
	Certain Event: The sample space is called 
the certain event if all possible outcomes are 
favourable outcomes. i.e. the event consists of 
the whole sample space.
Impossible Event: The empty set is called 
impossible event as no possible outcome is 
favorable.
Algebra of Events:
 Events are subsets of the sample space. 
Algebra of events uses operations in set theory 
to define new events in terms of known events.
Union of Two Events: Let A and B be 
two events in the sample space S. The union 
of A and B is denoted by A∪B and is the set 
of all possible outcomes that belong to at least 
one of A and B.
Ex. Let S = Set of all positive integers 
not exceeding 50;
Event A = Set of elements of S that are 
divisible by 6; and 
Event B = Set of elements of S that are 
divisible by 9. Find A∪B
Solution : 	
A = {6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48}
B = {9,18,27,36,45}  
∴ A∪B = {6,9,12,18,24,27,30,36,42,45, 48} is 
the set of elements of S that are divisible by 
6 or 9. 
Exhaustive Events: Two events A and B 
in the sample space S are said to be exhaustive 
if A∪B = S.
9
Probability

194
Example: Consider the experiment of 
throwing a die and noting the number on the 
top.
Let S be the sample space
∴ S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Let, A be the event that this number does 
not exceed 4, and 
B be the event that this number is not 
smaller than 3.
Then A = {1,2,3,4} B = {3,4,5,6}
and therefore, A∪B = {1,2,3,4,5,6} = S
∴ Events A and B are exhaustive. 
Intersection of Two Events: Let A and 
B be two events in the sample space S. The 
intersection of A and B is the event consisting 
of outcomes that belong to both the events A 
and B.
Example, Let S = Set of all positive 
integers not exceeding 50,
Event A = Set of elements of S that are 
divisible by 3, and
Event B = Set of elements of S that are 
divisible by 5.
Then A = {3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,
36,39,42,45,48},
B = {5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50} 
∴ A∩B = {15,30,45} is the set of 
elements of S that are divisible by both 3 
and 5.
Mutually Exclusive Events: Event A 
and B in the sample space S are said to be 
mutually exclusive if they have no outcomes 
in common. In other words, the intersection of 
mutually exclusive events is empty. Mutually 
exclusive events are also called disjoint events.
Example: Let S = Set of all positive 
integers not exceeding 50, 
Event A = set of elements of S that are 
divisible by 8, and
Event B = set of elements of S that are 
divisible by 13.
Then A = {8,16,24,32,40,48},
     B = {13,26,39}
∴ A∩B = φ because no element of S is 
divisible by both 8 and 13.
Note: If two events A and B are mutually 
exclusive and exhaustive, then they are called 
complementary events. 
Symbolically, A and B are complementary 
events if A∪B = S and A∩B = φ.
Notation: Complement of an event A is 
denoted by A', A  or Ac. The following table 
shows how the operations of complement, 
union, and intersection can be combined to 
define more events.
Operation 
Interpretation
A', A  or Ac
Not A.
A∪B
At least, one of A and B
A∩B
Both A and B
(A'∩B) ∪ (A∩B')
Exactly one of A and B
(A'∩B') = (A∪B)' 
Neither A nor B
SOLVED EXAMPLES:
Ex.	 1: Describe the sample space of the 
experiment when a coin and a die are thrown 
simultaneously.
Solution : Sample space S = {(H,1), (H,2), (H,3), 
(H,4), (H,5), (H,6), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), 
(T,5), (T,6)}
Ex.	 2: Sunita and Samrudhi who live in Mumbai 
wish to go on holiday to Delhi together. 
They can travel to Delhi from Mumbai either 
by car or by train or plane and on reaching 
Delhi they can go for city-tour either by bus 
or Taxi. Describe the sample space, showing 
all the combined outcomes of different ways 
they could complete city-tour from Mumbai.

195
Solution : Sample space
	
S = {(car, bus), (car, taxi), (train, bus), (train, 
taxi), (plane, bus), (plane, taxi)}
Ex.	 3: Three coins are tossed. Events E1, E2, E3 
and E4 are defined as follows.
	
E1 : Occurence of at least two heads.
	
E2 : Occurence of at least two tails.
	
E3 : Occurence of at most one head.
	
E4 : Occurence of two heads.
	
Describe the sample space and events E1, E2, 
E3 and E4. 
	
Find E1∪E4, E3'. Also check whether 
	
i)   E1 and E2 are mutually exclusive
	
ii)  E2 and E3 are equal
Solution : Sample space
S= {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, 
TTT}
E1: {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}
E2: {HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
E3: {HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
E4: {HHT, HTH, THH,}
E1∪E4 = {HTT, HTH, THH, HHH, HHT}
E3 = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}
i) E1∩E2 = {} = ϕ
∴ E1 and E2 are mutually exclusive.
ii) E2 and E3 are equal.
9.1.2 Concept of Probability:
A random experiment poses uncertainty 
regarding the actual result of the experiment, even 
though all possible outcomes are already known. 
The classical definition of probability is based on 
the assumption that all possible outcomes of an 
experiment are equally likely.
9.1.3 Equally likely outcomes: 
All possible outcomes of a random 
experiment are said to be equally likely if none 
of them can be preferred over others. 
9.1.4 Probability of an Event: 
The probability of an event A is defined as
P(A) = 
n(A)
n(S)  
Where, 
	
n(A)	 =	 number of outcomes favorable for 
event A,
	
n(S)	 =	 number of all possible outcomes. 
9.1.5 Elementary Properties of Probabilty:
1)	 A' is complement of A and therefore 
P(A') = 1 − P(A) 
2)	 For any event A in S, 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
3)	 For the impossible event φ, P(φ) = 0
4)	 For the certain event S, P(S) = 1
5)	 If A1 and A2 two mutually exclusive events 
then P(A1 ∪ A2) = P(A1) + P(A2)
6)	 If A ⊆ B, then P(A) ≤ P(B) and 
P(A'∩B) = P(B) - P(A)

S = {a1, a2, a3, ... an}. Let A1, A2, A3, ... An be 
elementary events given by Ai = {ai} with 
probability P(Ai). We have

When all elementary events given by Ai 
(i = 1, 2, 3, .... n) are equally likely, that is

If A is any event made up of m such 
elementary events, i.e. 
	
A = A1∪A2∪A3∪ ... ∪Am, then using property

P(A) = P(A1) + P(A2) + P(A3) +.... + P(Am)

SOLVED EXAMPLES
 
Ex. 1) If A∪B∪C = S (the sample space) and A, B 
and C are mutually exclusive events, can the 
following represent probability assignment?
	
i) 	 P(A) = 0.2, P(B) = 0.7, P(C) = 0.1
	
ii) 	P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.6, P(C) = 0.2
	
Solution:
	
i) 	 Since P(S) = P(A∪B∪C)
	
	
= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) [Property 10]
	
	
= 0.2 + 0.7 + 0.1 = 1
	
	
and 0≤ P(A), P(B), P(C) ≤ 1
 
∴ The given values can represent the 
probability assignment. 
	
ii) 	Since
	
	
P(S) 	 = P(A∪B∪C)
	
	
= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) [Property 10]
	
	
= 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.2 = 1.2 > 1
 
∴ P(A), P(B) and P(C) cannot represent 
probability assignment. 
Ex. 2) One card is drawn at random from a pack 
of 52 cards. What is the probability that it is 
a King or Queen?
	
Solution: 
	
Random Experiment = One card is drawn 
at random from a pack of 52 cards 
	
∴ n(S) = 52C1 = 52.
	
Let event A: Card drawn is King
	
and event B: Card drawn is Queen.
	
Since pack of 52 cards contains, 4 king cards 
from which any one king card can be drawn 
in 4C1 = 4 ways. ∴ n(A) = 4 
	
∴ P(A) =

Similarly, a pack of 52 cards contains, 4

197
	
Solution : Out of 20 employees, any 3 are to 
be selected in 20C3 ways.
	
∴ n(S) = 20C3 where S is the sample space.
	
Let event A: All 3 selected employees are

Y.
	
Solution: 
	
The word STORY consists of 5 different 
letters, which can be arranged among 
themselves in 5! ways. 
	
∴ n(S) = 5! = 120 
a) 	 Event A: T and Y are a together.
	
Let us consider T and Y as a single letter say 
X. Therefore, now we have four different 
letters X, S, O and R which can be arranged 
among themselves in 4! = 24 different ways. 
After this is done, two letters T and Y can be 
arranged among themselves in 2! = 2 ways. 
Therefore, by fundamental principle, total

9.2.1 Addition theorem for two events
For any two events A and B of a sample 
space S, P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A∩B). This 
is the property (7) that we had seen earlier. Since 
it is very important we give its proof. The other 
properties can also be proved in the same way.
	
This can be proved by two methods
a)	
Using the definition of probability.
b)	 Using Venn diagram. 
	
We assume that all outcomes are equally 
likely and sample space S contains finite 
number of outcomes.
(a) Using the definition of probability: 
If A and B are any two events, then event 
A∪B can be decomposed into two mutually 
exclusive events A∩B' and B
	
i.e. A∪B = (A∩B')∪B
 
∴ P(A∪B)	 = 	 P[(A∩B')∪B]
	
	
=	 P(A∩B') + P(B) 
	
	
[By property 10]
	
	
= 	 P(A) -  P(A∩B) + P(B) 	
	
	
[By property 8]
	
Hence P(A∪B)  = P(A) + P(B) − P(A∩B) 
(b) Using Venn diagram:
Let n(S) = n = Total no. of distinct possible 
outcomes in the sample space S.
n(A) = x, number of favourable outcomes 
for the occurrence of event A.
n(B) = y, number of favourable outcomes for 
the occurrence of event B.
n(A∩B) = z, the number of favourable 
outcomes for the occurrence of both event A and 
B.
∴ P(A) = 
n A
n S
( )
( )  = 
x
n , P(B) = n B
n S
( )
( )  = 
y
n
	
P(A∩B) = 
n(A
B)
n(S)
I
 = 
z
n
	
As all outcomes are equally likely. 
	
From Venn diagram 
Fig. 9.1
	
n(A∪B) = (x−z) + z + (y−z)
 
∴ n(A∪B) = x + y - z
	
n(A∪B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A∩B)
	
Dividing both sides by n(S), we get
n(A
B)
n(S)
U
 = 
n A
n S
( )
( )  + n B
n S

∴ P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B).

9.3.1 Conditional Probability: 
Let S be a sample space associated with the 
given random experiment. Let A and B be any 
two events defined on the sample space S. Then 
the probability of occurrence of event A under 
the condition that event B has already occurred 

202
and P(B) ≠0 is called conditional probability of 
event A given B and is denoted by P(A/B).
SOLVED EXAMPLES
 
Ex.1) A card is drawn from a pack of 
52 cards, given that it is a red card, what is the 
probability that it is a face card. 
Solution : Let event A: Red card is drawn 
and event B: face card is drawn
A card is drawn from a pack of 52 cards, 
therefore n(S) = 52. But we are given that red 
card is drawn, therefore our sample space reduces 
to event A only, which contains n(A) = 26 sample 
points. Event A is called reduced or truncated 
sample space. Out of 26 red cards, 6 cards are 
favourable for face cards.
∴ P[card drawn is face card given that it is a 
red card] = P[B/A] = 6 /26 = 3/13
Ex. 2) A pair of dice is thrown. If sum of the 
numbers is an odd number, what is the probability 
that sum is divisible by 3?
Solution : Let Event A: sum is an odd 
number.
Event B: Sum is divisible by 3.
A pair of dice is thrown, therefore n(S) = 36. 
But we are given that sum is odd, therefore our 
sample space reduces to event A only as follows:
A = {(1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), 
(3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (4,1), (4,3), (4,5), (5,2), (5,4), 
(5,6), (6,1), (6,3), (6,5)}
∴ n(A) = 18
Out of 18 sample points following 6 sample 
points are favourable for occurrence of event B
B = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3)}
∴ P[sum is divisible by 3 given that sum is 
an odd number] = P(B/A) = 6/18 = 1/3
9.3.2 Let S be a finite sample space, associated 
with the given random experiment, containing 
equally likely outcomes. Then we have the 
following result.
Statement: Conditional probability of event 
A given that event B has already occurred is 
given by 
P (A/B) = P(A
B)
P(B)
∩
, P(B) ≠ 0
(Read A/B as A given B)
Let S be a sample space associated with the 
given random experiment and n(S) be the number 
of sample points in the sample space S. Since 
we are given that event B has already occurred, 
therefore our sample space reduces to event B 
only, which contains n(B) sample points. Event B 
is also called reduced or truncated sample space. 
Now out of n(B) sample points, only n(A∩B) 
sample points are favourable for occurrence of 
event A. Therefore, by definition of probability
P(A/B) = n(A

n(B)

Ex. 2) If P(A') = 0.7, P(B) = 0.7, P(B/A) = 
0.5, find P(A/B) and P(A∪B).
Solution : Since 1 - P(A') = 0.7
P(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 − 0.7 = 0.3
Now P(B/A) = P(A∩B)/P(A)
∴ 0.5 = P(A∩B)/ 0.3
∴ P(A∩B) = 0.15
Again P(A/B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)
= 0.15/0.7 
∴ P(A/B) = 3/14
Further, by addition theorem 
P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)
= 0.3 + 0.7 - 0.15 = 0.85
9.3.3 Multiplication theorem:
Statement: Let S be sample space associated 
with the given random experiment. Let A and B 
be any two events defined on the sample space 
S. Then the probability of occurrence of both the 
events is denoted by P(A∩B) and is given by 
P(A∩B) = P(A).P(B/A)
Since P(B/A) = P(A

∴ P(A∩B) = P(A).P(B/A)
Similarly P(A∩B) = P(B).P(A/B)

Ex. 1) Two cards are drawn from a pack of 
52 cards one after other without replacement. 
What is the probability that both cards are ace 
cards?
Soln.: Let event A: first card drawn is an Ace 
card.
Let event B: second card drawn is an Ace

9.3.4 Independent Events:
Let S be sample space associated with the 
given random experiment. Let A and B be any 
two events defined on the sample space S. If 
the occurrence of either event, does not affect 
the probability of the occurence of the other 
event, then the two events A and B are said to be 
independent.
Thus, if A and B are independent events 
then, P(A/B) = P(A/B') = P(A) and
P(B/A) = P(B/A') = P(B)
Remark: If A and B are independent events 
then P(A∩B) = P(A).P(B)
note that P(A∩B) = P(A).(B/A) 
	
	
	
 = P(A).P(B)
∴ P(A∩B) = P(A).P(B) 
In general, if A1, A2, A3, ...  An are n mutually 
independent events, then 
P (A1∩A2∩.... ∩An) = P(A1).P(A2)...P(An)
Theorem:
If A and B are independent events then
a) A and B' are also independent event
b) A' and B' are also independent event
Proof:	Since A and B are independent, 
	
	
therefore P(A∩B) = P(A).P(B) ... (1)
a)  P(A∩B') =P(A) - P(A∩B)
     = P(A) - P(A).P(B) [From (1)]
	
= P(A){1 - P(B)}
	
= P(A).P(B')
 
∴ A and B' are also independent.
b)  P(A'∩B')	= P(A∪B)' 
	
(By De Morgan's Law)
	
= 1 - P(A∪B)
	
= 1 -[P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)]
	
= 1 - P(A) - P(B) + P(A).P(B)
	
	
	
	
      from (I)
	
= [1- P(A)] - P(B)[1 - P(A)]
	
= [1- P(A)]  [1 - P(B)]
	
= P(A').P(B')
∴A' and B' are also independent.

sometimes Bayes' Rule). This is a direct 
application of conditional probabilities. Bayes' 
theorem is useful, to determine posterior 
probabilities.
Theorem : If E1, E2, E3 ... En are mutually 
exclusive and exhaustive events with P(Ei) ≠ 
0, where i = 1, 2, 3 ... n then for any arbitrary 
event A which is a subset of the union of 
events Ei such that P(A) > 0, we have

(A ∩ E3) ... ∪ (A ∩ En) 
	
A ∩ E1,  A ∩ E2, A ∩ E3 ... A ∩ En are 
mutually exclusive events
	
So, P(A) = P[(A ∩ E1) ∪ (A ∩ E2)  ∪

Three types of probabilities occur in the above 
formula P(Ei), P(A/Ei), P(Ei/A)
i) 	 The probabilities occur in the above formula 
P(Ei), i = 1, 2, 3, ... n are such that P(E1) 
+ P(E2) + .... + P(En) = 1 are called prior 
probabilities, since they are known before 
conducting experiment. 
ii) 	 The probabilities P(A/Ei) tell us, how likely 
the event A under consideration occurs, 
given each and every prior probability. They 
may refer to as likelihood probabilities of 
the event A, given that event Ei has already 
occurred. 
iii) 	 The 
conditional 
probabilities 
P(Ei/A) 
are called posterior probabilities, as they 
obtained after conducting experiment.

another bag contains 5 red and 8 blue balls. A 
ball is drawn from first bag and without noticing 
colour is put in the second bag. A ball is drawn 
from the second bag. Find the probability that 
ball drawn is blue in colour.
Solution: Let event E1: Red ball is drawn 
from the first bag and event E2: Blue ball is drawn 
from the first bag.
∴ P(E1) = 6/11 and P(E2) = 5

Solution : If A is the event that the car needs

probabilities):
Let n be number of distinct sample points 
in the sample space S. Out of n sample points, m 
sample points are favourable for the occurrence 
of event A. Therefore remaining (n-m) sample 
points are favourable for the occurrence of its 
complementary event A'.
∴ P(A) = m

SOLVED EXAMPLES
 
Ex. 1: A fair die is thrown. What are the odds 
in favour of getting a number which is a perfect 
square in uppermost face of die?
Soln.: Random experiment: A fair die is 
thrown. 
∴ Sample space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
∴ n(S) = 6
Let event A: die shows number which is a 
perfect square.
∴A = {1, 4} ∴m = n(A) = 2
∴A' = {2, 3, 5, 6} ∴ (n - m) = 4.
∴P(A) = m
n  = 2
6  = 1
3
P(A') = n−m
n  = 4
6  = 2
3
∴ Odds in favour of event 
A = P(A): P(A') = 1/3
2/3  = 1

Ex. 2: The probability of one event A 
happening is the square of the probability of 
second event B, but the odds against the event A 
are the cube of the odds against the event B. Find 
the probability of each event.
Solution : Let P(A) = p1 and P(B) = p2.
∴ probability on non-occurrence of the 
events A and B are (1-p1) and (1-p2) respectively. 
We are given that p1 = (p2)2 .... (I)
Odds against the event A =  1-p1
p1
 
Odds against the event B = 1-p2

Let's Remember
A.N. Kolmogorov, a Russian mathematician 
outlined an axiomatic definition of probability 
that formed the basis of the modern theory. For 
every event A of sample space S, we assign a 
non-negative real number denoted by P(A) and is 
called probability of A, which satisfied following 
three axioms
1) 0 ≤ P(A)≤ 1
2) P(S) = 1
If A and B are mutually exclusive events, 
then P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B)
Addition theorem: 
If A and B are any two events defined on 
the same sample space S, then probability of 
occurrence of at least one event is denoted by 
P(A∪B)and is given by P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) 
- P(A∩B)
Conditional probability: 
If A and B are any two events defined on the 
same sample space S, then conditional probability 
of event A given that event B has already occurred 
is denoted by P(A/B)
∴ P(A/B) = P(A∩B) / P(B), P(B) ≠ 0
Similarly, P(B/A) = P(A∩B) / P(A), P(A) ≠0
Multiplication theorem: 
If A and B are any two events defined 
on the same sample space S, then probability 
of simultaneous occurrence of both events is 
denoted by P(A∩B) and is given by P(A∩B) = 
P(A)P(B/A)
Independent events:
If the occurrence of any one event does not 
depend on occurrence of other event, then two 
events A and B are said to be independent.
i.e. if P(A/B) = P(A/B') = P(A)
or P(B/A) = P(B/A') = P(B)
then A and B are independent events.
∴ P(A∩B) = P(A)P(B)
If A and B are independent events then
a)	A and B' are also independent events
b) 	A' and B' are also independent events.
Bayes' Theorem : 
If E1, E2, E3 ... En are mutually exclusive and 
exhaustive events with P(E1) ≠ 0, where i = 1,2,3 
... n. then for any arbitrary event A which is a 
subset of the union of events E such that P(A) > 
0, we have
P(Ei/A) =
