Theoretical and Mathematical Physics
The series founded in 1975 and formerly (until 2005) entitled Texts and Monographs in
Physics (TMP) publishes high-level monographs in theoretical and mathematical
physics. The change of title to Theoretical and Mathematical Physics (TMP) signals that
the series is a suitable publication platform for both the mathematical and the theoretical
physicist. The wider scope of the series is reﬂected by the composition of the editorial
board, comprising both physicists and mathematicians.
The books, written in a didactic style and containing a certain amount of elementary
background material, bridge the gap between advanced textbooks and research
monographs. They can thus serve as basis for advanced studies, not only for lectures
and seminars at graduate level, but also for scientists entering a ﬁeld of research.

Introduction
This is the second part of our book on Differential Geometry and Mathematical
Physics. It is based on our teaching of these subjects at the University of Leipzig to
students of physics and of mathematics and on our research in gauge ﬁeld theory
over many years.
As in Part I, let us start with some historical remarks. The concept of gauge
invariance ﬁrst appeared in the famous papers [660] and [661] of Hermann Weyl
from the year 1918.1 In this work, Weyl extended Einstein's principle of general
relativity by postulating that, additionally, the scale of length can vary smoothly
from point to point in spacetime. In more detail, Weyl's basic idea was to develop a
purely inﬁnitesimal geometry. Behind that concept was his belief that 'a true
inﬁnitesimal geometry should, however, recognize only a principle for transferring
the magnitude of a vector to an inﬁnitesimally close point ...', see page 25 in [660].
In this context, the notion of connection appeared for the ﬁrst time in the mathe-
matical literature.2 In a modern geometric language, he was led to a generalization
of Riemannian geometry characterized by a pair consisting of a conformal
Riemannian structure and a connection in a line bundle over spacetime. Weyl
proposed to identify the connection form with the electromagnetic gauge potential
and, consequently, its curvature with the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor. Thus, he
obtained a uniﬁcation of general relativity with electromagnetism. However, it
quickly became clear that this model was not compatible with basic physical
principles. It was Einstein who observed that if this theory was correct, then the
behaviour of clocks would depend on their history. This is in contradiction with
empirical evidence.3 Although this model did not survive, the gauge principle did
though. In 1929 Weyl proposed to apply it to quantum mechanics. He recognized
1In these papers, the term 'gauge invariance' appears in German as 'Maßstab-Invarianz'.
2Of course, there were predecessors, notably Christoffel, Ricci and Levi-Civita. The latter had a
clear mathematical understanding of parallel transport and of the covariant derivative operator, but
up to our knowledge, he did not invent the term 'connection'.
3See the postscript by Einstein in [660] and the author's reply. This started a long discussion
between Weyl and Einstein. For further reference, see also [604] and [496].

that it is the phase of the Schrödinger wave function which should be gauged, see
[663]. In more detail, the idea of Weyl was as follows: since only the absolute value
of the wave function has a physical interpretation, the wave function itself may be
multiplied by an arbitrary point-dependent phase factor.4 However, the transformed
wave function obviously does not satisfy the Schrödinger equation any more. In
order to restore invariance, Weyl proposed to replace the partial derivatives with
respect to space and time coordinates occurring in the Schrödinger equation by the
covariant derivatives obtained by adding to the partial derivatives the components
of the electromagnetic potential. This modiﬁed Schrödinger equation is invariant
under simultaneous gauge transformations of the wave function and of the
electromagnetic potential. This way, the ﬁrst quantum mechanical model of a
U(1)-gauge theory was born.
The combination of this U(1)-gauge principle with the quantum theory of ﬁelds
led to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). For an exhaustive historical introduction
to that theory we refer to Volume I of [654], see Sect. 1.2. The early contributions
to the development of QED date back to the late 1920s and are due to Dirac [152],
Weisskopf and Wigner [658], Jordan and Pauli [350], Jordan and Wigner [351] and
Heisenberg and Pauli [292]. In the 1930s, QED was studied intensively leading to a
further development of the formalism as well as to successful applications. This
period culminated in the famous Solvay report by Pauli in 1939, see [505]. Clearly,
the biggest puzzle was the emergence of inﬁnities in various kinds of calculations.
Amongst a number of approaches to tackle this problem, in the end, the concept of
renormalization of the parameters of the theory became the widely accepted strat-
egy. In this spirit, in the late 1940s, Schwinger [579], Tomonaga [629] and
Feynman [194] brought QED to its ﬁnal manifestly relativistic form.5
The ﬁrst non-Abelian gauge theory was proposed by Yang and Mills in 1954,
see [685].6 Their work was based on the idea that the forces between the nucleons
were mediated by the exchange of pions and that the interaction was invariant under
the isospin group SU(2). In this model, the proton and the neutron form an isospin
doublet and the three charged states of the pion form a triplet in the adjoint rep-
resentation. Yang and Mills postulated the principle of local isotopic gauge
invariance. As a consequence, they were led to introduce an SU(2)-gauge potential.
They found the ﬁeld equations of this system, proposed a generalization of the
Lorenz gauge ﬁxing condition and made preliminary remarks on the quantum
theory of their model. The paper by Yang and Mills dealt with the special gauge
group SU(2) only, but from their presentation it was clear how to generalize the
4In the group theoretical language, such a transformation is given by a function on spacetime with
values in the Abelian group U(1).
5For this work, Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.
Initially, Feynman's diagrammatic technique seemed quite different from the operator-based
approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but Dyson [171] showed that the two approaches were
equivalent.
6There was an earlier paper by Klein [378] written in the spirit of Kaluza-Klein theory which
already contained a non-Abelian gauge potential.

model to an arbitrary non-Abelian gauge group, see [639] and [236]. It took over
ten more years before this seminal paper came into prominence. In 1964 Gell-Mann
and Ne'eman [235], [237] proposed SU(3) as the gauge group of strong interactions
and in the years 1964-1967 Brout and Englert [106], Higgs [298-300] and Kibble
[364] discovered a symmetry-breaking mechanism which gave a mass to some
components of the Yang-Mills ﬁeld. Based on this work and on earlier work by
Glashow [247] and others, in the years 1967-1968 Weinberg [654] and Salam
[552] uniﬁed the electromagnetic and the weak interactions.7 At the beginning
of the 1970s, Gross and Wilczek [264], Politzer [513] and Weinberg [656] created
the theory of strong interactions called Quantum Chromodynamics. These theories
became the two basic building blocks of the standard model of elementary particle
physics.8
In the period just described, Weyl's original ingenious understanding that the
gauge principle is closely related to the notion of connection did not play any role.9
The development of the theory of connections evolved in a completely separate way
as part of modern geometry and was generally unknown to the physics community.
In the beginning of the 1920s, on the basis of his deep expertise in Lie theory and
under the inﬂuence of Einstein's theory of general relativity and of Klein's Erlangen
programme, Élie Cartan started building a general theory of connections with
respect to various groups. In contrast to Weyl, who used the absolute differential
calculus of Levi-Civita and Ricci, Cartan relied on the calculus of differential forms.
In the context of what he called 'generalized spaces',10 Cartan developed the theory
of connections (including torsion) for various types of geometries (Riemannian,
Lorentzian, Weylian, afﬁne, conformal, projective and others), see [115-120] and
further references in [130] and [568].11 The next step forward was taken at the
beginning of the 1940s by Ehresmann, a student of Cartan, who proposed to use
ﬁbre bundles as the natural geometric structure allowing for a global description of
a connection, see [174-176] and [410] for further references.12 As a matter of fact,
the very notion of a ﬁbre bundle existed already at that time. It was invented by
Seifert [584] as early as in 1932. In the 1930s and 1940s, the study of ﬁbre bundles
7For this work, Glashow, Weinberg and Salam received the Nobel prize in 1979.
8For an exhaustive presentation of the history of the standard model see [657].
9However, inspired by the work of Einstein, Weyl, Yang, Mills and Utiyama, as early as in 1963,
Lubkin [411] made a ﬁrst step towards the analysis of the geometric content of the gauge concept
in terms of connection theory in ﬁbre bundles.
10A generalized space in the sense of Cartan is a space of tangent spaces such that two inﬁnitely
near tangent spaces are related by an inﬁnitesimal transformation of a given Lie group. Such a
structure clearly deﬁnes a connection. We note that the tangent space is an abstract notion here, it
may not coincide with the space of tangent vectors.
11The paper [130] by Chern and Chevalley contains a description of the work of Cartan as a whole.
The paper [568] by Scholz gives some interesting insight into the scientiﬁc interrelation between
Weyl and Cartan.
12The paper [410] by Libermann describes the inﬂuence of Ehresmann on the development of
modern differential geometry in detail.

Ehresmann and Feldbau (already cited above), Chern14 [126-129] and Pontryagin
[516]. This period culminated in the textbooks on the topology of ﬁbre bundles by
Steenrod [599] and on the geometry of connections in ﬁbre bundles by Nomizu
[491]. By that time, the theory of ﬁbre bundles was settled as a classical ﬁeld of
geometry and topology. It is beyond the scope of this introduction to describe the
further development of this ﬁeld up until the present time.
The ﬁrst full description of gauge theory in the language of ﬁbre bundles and
connections was presented by Trautman in 1970 [630]. Thereafter, the study of the
geometric structure of gauge theories quickly became part of mathematical physics
and, within the next decade, quite a number of papers propagating this geometric
point of view have been written, see e.g. [161], [173] and [147]. This was related to
the fact that, at that time, mathematicians became excited about questions posed by
physicists, notably by the question of how to ﬁnd all self-dual solutions of the
Yang-Mills equations. This problem was solved by Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and
Manin [36] using methods of algebraic geometry. In our eyes, this is one of the
most fascinating interactions of geometry and physics in the second half of the
twentieth century. Via the study of the moduli space of the solutions, it led to deep
new insight into the topology of differentiable four-manifolds, see [159]. In the
middle of the 1990s, guided by the study of the vacuum structure of N = 2
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, Seiberg and Witten [582, 583] arrived at a
U(1)-gauge model coupled to a spinor ﬁeld. The investigation of this model gave a
new impetus to the study of the topology of differentiable four-manifolds. Within a
few months, many of the results obtained via instanton theory were reproved within
this new theory and new results, notably in the theory of symplectic manifolds,
were obtained. Yet another fruitful interaction of physics and geometry happened in
the theory of magnetic monopoles. The three ﬁelds of research just mentioned will
be discussed in some detail in Chaps. 6 and 7. By the end of the 1970s and the
beginning of the 1980s, geometrical and topological methods also started playing a
role in quantum gauge theory. This applies, in particular to the study of the Gribov
problem and to anomalies. Both of these aspects will be discussed in Chap. 9.
Moreover, starting from the beginning of the 1990s, a number of observations,
conjectures and results concerning the relevance of the stratiﬁed structure of the
gauge orbit space for quantum gauge theory appeared. This is one of our ﬁelds of
research, so we will discuss the structure of the gauge orbit stratiﬁcation, together
with a concept how to implement it on quantum level, in detail in Chaps. 8 and 9.
We continue with a few remarks on the structure and the content of this volume.
This volume consists of three building blocks: in the ﬁrst four chapters we present
the geometry and topology of ﬁbre bundles, in Chap. 5 we study the theory of Dirac
operators and the remaining four chapters are devoted to gauge theory. In more

Introduction

detail, in Chap. 1, we study principal and associated bundles and develop the theory
of connections. This includes elementary bundle reduction theory, the theory of
holonomy and the theory of invariant connections. In Chap. 2, we study linear
connections in the frame bundle of a manifold and their reductions. This leads us to
H-structures15 allowing for a uniﬁed view on possible geometric structures mani-
folds may be endowed with. From this perspective, Riemannian geometry occurs as
an important special example. In this context, we study compatible connections, the
relation of curvature and holonomy and we give an introduction to the theory of
symmetric spaces. Moreover, we present elementary Hodge theory and discuss
some aspects of 4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. In Chap. 3, we study the
homotopy theory of ﬁbre bundles. We prove the Covering Homotopy Theorem and
develop the concept of universal bundles. Using this tool, we prove the fundamental
classiﬁcation theorem for principal bundles in terms of homotopy classes of map-
pings. We also include a discussion of universal connections. In Chap. 4, we
present the basics of the cohomology theory of ﬁbre bundles. We study the
cohomology rings of characteristic classes for the classical groups, derive the
Whitney Sum Formula and the Splitting Principle and discuss the effect of ﬁeld
restrictions and ﬁeld extensions. Next, we present the characteristic classes in terms
of de Rham cohomology via the Weil homomorphism and discuss the related
genera. Finally, we discuss the concept of Postnikov tower and show how it may be
used to classify bundles over low-dimensional manifolds. Chap. 5 is devoted to the
study of Dirac operators. Given their great importance in gauge theory, we provide
the reader with a systematic and quite exhaustive presentation. We start with
Clifford algebras, spinor groups and their representations. Next, we discuss spin
structures, Dirac bundles and Dirac operators. Since we are going to use the
Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem in gauge theory a number of times, we give a full
proof of this theorem via the heat kernel method. In the remaining four chapters, we
present topics in gauge theory. Clearly, we had to make a choice here, that is, we
had to omit a number of interesting topics like, say, topological ﬁeld theory. In
Chap. 6, we study pure gauge theories. We start by deriving the Yang-Mills
equations from the variational principle for the Yang-Mills action and show that
(anti-)self-dual solutions correspond to absolute minima of the action. We then
present a systematic study of instantons: we discuss the BPST-instanton family in
detail, present the ADHM-construction and give a partial proof that via that con-
struction one obtains all solutions. In our presentation, we limit our attention to the
base space S4 and to the gauge group G = SU(2). Next, we study the moduli space
and outline how it is used for the study of the topology of differentiable
4-manifolds. Finally, we present the classical stability analysis of the Yang-Mills
Equation and include a short discussion of non-minimal solutions. In Chap. 7, we
include matter ﬁelds. We start with the theory of Yang-Mills-Higgs models: we
discuss the Higgs mechanism, present a topological classiﬁcation of static
ﬁnite-energy conﬁgurations and address the problem of constructing asymptotic as
15In the literature, the term G-structure is common as well.

well as exact solutions to the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations. In particular, we focus
on magnetic monopole solutions including the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld
model. Next, we pass to the Seiberg-Witten model. We discuss the basic properties
of this model in detail and outline some of the topological consequences. Next, we
present the (classical) standard model of elementary particle physics in the geo-
metric language. In the remaining two sections, we give an introduction to the
method of dimensional reduction in the context of gauge theories including some of
our own results. Chap. 8 is devoted to the study of the gauge orbit stratiﬁcation. In
the ﬁrst part, we provide the reader with the classical geometrical and topological
results on that structure. In the second part, we present our own results on the
classiﬁcation of gauge orbit types in some detail. For clearness of presentation, we
limit our attention to the case G = SU(n). The classiﬁcation is in terms of char-
acteristic classes (fulﬁlling a number of algebraic relations) of certain reductions
of the principal bundle under consideration. We also show how to derive the natural
partial ordering of strata. Finally, in Chap. 9, we come to some elements of
quantum gauge theory with the main emphasis on those aspects which are related to
the structure of the classical gauge orbit space in one or the other way. In the ﬁrst
part, we present the classical Faddeev-Popov path integral quantization procedure,
address the Gribov problem in the language of differential geometry and discuss the
classical results of Singer concerning the obstruction against the existence of a
global gauge ﬁxing. Next, we discuss anomalies within the geometric setting. In the
second part, we present some of our results on non-perturbative quantum gauge
theory for (ﬁnite) lattice models in the Hamiltonian framework. We construct the
quantum model via canonical quantization, derive the ﬁeld algebra and the
observable algebra of the system and discuss the Gauß law. Next, we explain how
to include the non-generic gauge orbit strata on the quantum level and discuss their
possible physical relevance for a toy model.
We assume that the reader is familiar with the calculus on manifolds as presented
in Chaps. 1-4 of Part I and with the theory of Lie groups and Lie group actions as
presented in Chaps. 5 and 6 of Part I. For the understanding of Chaps. 3 and 4, basic
knowledge in homotopy theory and some elements of algebraic topology are
needed. In Chap. 9, we use elements of the theory of C-algebras. For the con-
venience of the reader we have added a number of appendices.

Introduction

Chapter 1
Fibre Bundles and Connections
In this chapter, we present the basics of the theory of ﬁbre bundles and connections.
In the ﬁrst part, we discuss principal and asssociated bundles and the theory of
connections including the Koszul calculus. The text is illustrated by many examples
which will be taken up later on. In the second part, we focus on topics which are
particularly important in this book. We study bundle reductions, discuss the theory
of holonomy in some detail and analyze the transformation laws of connection and
curvature under bundle automorphisms. Finally, we present the theory of invariant
connections for the case of group actions which are not necessarily transitive on the
base manifold, that is, we go beyond the classical Wang Theorem.
1.1
Principal Bundles
In a gauge theory describing the fundamental interaction of elementary particles, the
interaction is assumed to be mediated by a gauge potential. In geometric terms, a
gauge potential is the local (spacetime) representative of a connection form, which
naturally lives on a principal ﬁbre bundle over spacetime.
Let us recall the following deﬁnition from Sect.6.5 of Part I.
Deﬁnition 1.1.1 (Principal bundle) Let (P, G, Ψ ) be a free Lie group action, let M
be a manifold and let π : P →M be a smooth mapping. The tuple (P, G, M, Ψ, π)
is called a principal bundle if for every m ∈M there exists an open neighbourhood
U of m and a diffeomorphism χ : π−1(U) →U × G such that
1. χ intertwines Ψ with the G-action on U × G by translations1 on the factor G,
2. prU ◦χ(p) = π(p) for all p ∈π−1(U).
1Left (right) translations if Ψ is a left (right) action.

Fibre Bundles and Connections
For simplicity, we will sometimes use the short-hand notation P(M, G) or just P. If
not otherwise stated, we will consider right principal bundles. If there is no danger of
confusion, sometimes we will simply write Ψg(p) = p · g. For a right action, denoting
κ := prG ◦χ : π−1(U) →G,
(1.1.1)
condition 1 can be rewritten as
κ(Ψa(p)) = κ(p)a,
p ∈π−1(U), a ∈G .
(1.1.2)
The group G is called the structure group of P. If G is ﬁxed, P is referred to as a
principal G-bundle. The pair (U, χ) is called a local trivialization. A local trivial-
ization (U, χ) with U = M is called a global trivialization. If there exists a global
trivialization, then P is called trivial. The existence of local trivializations implies
that π is a surjective submersion. Hence, by Proposition I/1.7.6, the subsets π−1(m),
m ∈M, are embedded submanifolds, called the ﬁbres of P. They are diffeomorphic
to the group manifold G.
Remark 1.1.2 Let (P, G, Ψ ) be a free proper Lie group action. Let M be the orbit
space, equipped with the smooth structure provided by Corollary I/6.5.1, and let π :
P →M be the natural projection to orbits. Every tubular neighbourhood of an orbit
deﬁnes a local trivialization over a neighbourhood of the corresponding point of M.
Hence, the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem I/6.4.3 implies that (P, G, M, Ψ, π) is a
principal bundle. Conversely, if (P, G, M, Ψ, π) is a principal bundle, then (P, G, Ψ )
is a free proper Lie group action, M is diffeomorphic to the orbit space P/G and π
corresponds, via this diffeomorphism, to the natural projection to orbits.
♦
We will also need the general notion of ﬁbre bundle.
Deﬁnition 1.1.3 (General ﬁbre bundle) Let E and M be manifolds and let π : E →
M be a smooth surjection. The triple (E, M, π) is called a ﬁbre bundle if there
exists a manifold F such that the following holds. Every m ∈M admits an open
neighbourhood U and a diffeomorphism χ : π−1(U) →U × F fulﬁlling prU ◦χ =
π. The manifold F is called the typical ﬁbre of π.
The details of the following example are left to the reader (Exercise 1.1.1).
Example 1.1.4
1. Let M be a manifold, let G be a Lie group and let prM : M × G →M be the natural
projection. Then, (M × G, G, M, Ψ, prM), with Ψ given by right translation of G
on the second factor of M × G, is a principal bundle, called the product principal
bundle. It is obviously trivial.
2. Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle and let U ⊂M be open. Deﬁne PU :=
π−1(U) and take the restrictions πU : PU →U of π and ΨU : PU × G →PU of
Ψ . By intersection, any local trivialization of P induces a local trivialization of
PU. Thus, (PU, G, U, ΨU, πU) is a principal G-bundle over U.

1.1 Principal Bundles
3
3. Let P1(M1, G1) and P2(M2, G2) be principal bundles. Then, the direct product
P1 × P2 carries the structure of a principal (G1 × G2)-bundle over M1 × M2.
4. Let G be a Lie group and let H ⊂G be a closed subgroup. Consider the free
action of H on G by right translation. By Example I/6.3.8/3, this action is proper.
Thus, Remark 1.1.2 implies that G carries the structure of a principal H-bundle
over the homogeneous space G/H.2
♦
Deﬁnition 1.1.5 Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle. A section of P is a
smooth mapping s: M →P such that π ◦s = idM. A local section of P over an
open subset U ⊂M is a section of the principal bundle PU.
Proposition 1.1.6 Local trivializations of P are in one-to-one correspondence with
local sections. In particular, a principal bundle is trivial iff it admits a global section.
Proof If χ : P →M × G is a global trivialization, then we set s(m) := χ−1(m, 1),
where 1 is the unit element in G. This is a smooth global section of P. Conversely,
given a global section s: M →P, for every point p ∈P there exists a unique group
element κ(p) such that p = Ψκ(p)(s(π(p))). This deﬁnes a smooth mapping κ : P →
G, which fulﬁls κ(Ψa(p)) = κ(p) a. Thus, (M, π × κ) is a global trivialization.
■
Next, we introduce the notion of morphism of principal bundles.
Deﬁnition 1.1.7 (Morphism) Let (P1, G1, M1, Ψ 1, π1) and (P2, G2, M2, Ψ 2, π2) be
principal ﬁbre bundles.
1. A morphism from P1 to P2 is a pair of mappings (ϑ, λ), where ϑ : P1 →P2
is smooth and λ: G1 →G2 is a homomorphism of Lie groups such that for all
g ∈G1
ϑ ◦Ψ 1
g = Ψ 2
λ(g) ◦ϑ.
(1.1.3)
2. A morphism (ϑ, λ) is called an isomorphism if ϑ is a diffeomorphism and λ is an
isomorphism of Lie groups. In particular, an isomorphism of a principal bundle
onto itself is called an automorphism.
We note that, by Deﬁnition I/6.6.1, a morphism of principal bundles P1 and P2 is a
morphism of the Lie group actions (P1, G1, Ψ 1) and (P2, G2, Ψ 2).
Remark 1.1.8 (Special morphisms)
1. By condition (1.1.3), ϑ maps ﬁbres to ﬁbres. Thus, it induces a mapping ˜ϑ :
M1 →M2 such that the following diagram commutes.
P1
ϑ

2This statement also follows from Theorem I/5.7.2 and Remark I/5.7.3.

By local triviality, ˜ϑ is smooth. We say that ϑ projects to ˜ϑ, or that ϑ covers ˜ϑ.
If (ϑ, λ) is an isomorphism, then ˜ϑ is a diffeomorphism. Given isomorphisms
ϑ1 : P1 →P2 and ϑ2 : P2 →P3, we have (Exercise 1.1.3)
(ϑ2 ◦ϑ1)∼= ˜ϑ2 ◦˜ϑ1,

ϑ−1

∼= ˜ϑ−1
1 .
(1.1.4)
2. If the principal bundles P and Q have the same base manifold M and if ˜ϑ = idM,
then (ϑ, λ) is said to be vertical. If P and Q have the same structure group G
and if λ = idG, then ϑ is called a G-morphism. By local triviality, every vertical
G-morphism is a diffeomorphism and hence an isomorphism.
3. If ˜ϑ and λ are injective immersions, then ϑ is an injective immersion, too. In this
case, P1 is called a subbundle of P2.
(a) If, additionally, ˜ϑ and λ are embeddings, then P is called an embedded
subbundle. In this case, P1 may be identiﬁed with the image of the morphism
ϑ in P2.
(b) If, additionally, M1 = M2 = M and ˜ϑ = idM, then P1 is referred to as a λ-
reduction or, simply, a reduction of P2. In this case, one says that G1 is a
reduction of the structure group G2. Two reductions are said to be equivalent
if they differ by a vertical automorphism of P.
♦
Remark 1.1.9 (Pullback of principal bundles)
1. In complete analogy to vector bundles, see Sect.2.6 of Part I, given a principal
G-bundle P over M with canonical projection π, we deﬁne its pullback by a
smooth mapping ϕ : N →M:
ϕ∗P := {(y, p) ∈N × P: ϕ(y) = π(p)} .
This is a principal G-bundle over N and the canonical projection N × P →P
restricts to a morphism ϕ∗P →P covering ϕ. One can show the following (Exer-
cise 1.1.4).
(a) If P is vertically isomorphic to some principal G-bundle Q over M, then f ∗P
is vertically isomorphic to f ∗Q.
(b) If ψ : K →N is a further smooth mapping, then ψ∗(ϕ∗P) is vertically iso-
morphic to (ϕ ◦ψ)∗P.
(c) Let ϑ : P →Q be a principal G-bundle morphism covering ˜ϑ : M →N.
The induced mapping
P →˜ϑ∗Q,
p →

π(p), ϑ(p)

,
is a vertical isomorphism and ϑ decomposes into the composition of this
isomorphism with the natural principal G-bundle morphism ˜ϑ∗Q →Q.
2. The following is an important special class of pullback bundles. Let P1(M, G1)
and P2(M, G2) be principal bundles. By Example 1.1.4/3, P1 × P2 carries the

1.1 Principal Bundles
5
structure of a principal (G1 × G2)-bundle over M × M. Let Δ : M →M × M be
the diagonal embedding. Then, Δ∗(P1 × P2) is a principal bundle with structure
group G1 × G2 over M. It will be denoted by P1 ×M P2 and will be called the
ﬁbre product of P1 and P2.3
♦
In complete analogy with vector bundles, principal ﬁbre bundles can be character-
ized and studied in terms of transition mappings associated with a chosen covering of
the base manifold. Let there be given a principal bundle P(M, G). By deﬁnition, one
can choose a countable open covering {Ui}i∈I of M such that there exists a system of
local trivializations
χi : π−1(Ui) →Ui × G.
The collection {(Ui, χi)}i∈I will sometimes also be called a bundle atlas of P. Let
κi : π−1(Ui) →Gbethecorrespondingsystemofmappingsdeﬁnedby(1.1.1).Then,
κi(Ψa(p)) · κj(Ψa(p))−1 = κi(p) · a · a−1 · κj(p)−1 = κi(p) · κj(p)−1,
that is, the mappings π−1(Ui ∩Uj) ∋p →κi(p) · κj(p)−1 ∈G are constant on ﬁbres.
Thus, they induce smooth mappings
Ui ∩Uj ∋m →ρij(m) := κi(p) · κj(p)−1 ∈G,
p ∈π−1(m),
(1.1.5)
which are called the transition mappings of P. They fulﬁl
ρij(m) = ρik(m) · ρkj(m),
m ∈Ui ∩Uj ∩Uk.
(1.1.6)
This condition implies, in particular,
ρii(m) = 1,
m ∈Ui,
ρij(m) = (ρji(m))−1,
m ∈Ui ∩Uj.
Proposition 1.1.10 Let M be a manifold and let G be a Lie group. Then, for every
countable open covering {Ui}i∈I of M and every system of smooth mappings ρij :
Ui ∩Uj →G fulﬁlling condition (1.1.6) there exists a principal G-bundle over M
admitting a system of local trivializations with transition mappings {ρij}.
Proof Take the topological direct sum
X :=

i∈I
Ui × G.
3Some authors call it the spliced product [83].

Fibre Bundles and Connections
We deﬁne
(i, m, g) ∼(i′, m′, g′) iff m′ = m, g′ = ρii′(m) · g,
which, by condition (1.1.6), yields an equivalence relation on X. We denote by
P = X/ ∼the topological quotient and by pr : X →P the canonical projection.
Since X admits a countable basis, P admits a countable basis, too. Moreover, it is
easy to show that P is Hausdorff, see Exercise 1.1.2. We endow P with the structure
of a principal G-bundle. For that purpose, we deﬁne
Ψ : P × G →P,
Ψ ([(i, m, a)], b) := [(i, m, a · b)].
Clearly, this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representative (i, m, a).
Thus, Ψ deﬁnes a topological right group action, which is obviously free. By con-
struction,[(i, m, a)] = [(i′, m′, a′)]impliesm′ = m.Thus,wecandeﬁneacontinuous
mapping
π : P →M,
π([(i, m, a)]) := m.
Since the Ui cover M, π is surjective. Let pri be the restriction of pr to Ui × G. By
construction, for every i ∈I, it deﬁnes a bijection
pri : Ui × G →π−1(Ui).
We endow P with the structure of a differentiable manifold by observing that π−1(Ui)
is an open subset and by postulating that pri be a diffeomorphism for every i ∈I.
With respect to this differentiable structure, the action Ψ is smooth. Finally, putting
χi := pr−1
i
: π−1(Ui) →Ui × G
we get a system of local trivializations whose transition mappings coincide with
the mappings ρij. Moreover, by the deﬁnition of Ψ , the induced mappings κi :
π−1(Ui) →G fulﬁl condition (1.1.2).
■
Our next aim is to show that vertical isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles
over M can be labelled in terms of the ﬁrst ˇCech cohomology of M. Thus, let P1 and P2
be isomorphic principal G-bundles over M via a morphism (ϑ, λ). Let {(Ui, χ1
i )} and
{(Ui, χ2
i )} be local trivializations and let {ρ1
ij} and {ρ2
ij} be the corresponding transition
mappings of P1 and P2, respectively. Here, again without loss of generality, we have
assumed that both trivializations are associated with one and the same covering of
M. Let m ∈Ui ∩Uj. Since p ∈π−1
1 (m) implies ϑ(p) ∈π−1
2 (m), using (1.1.5), we
obtain

Thus, for every m ∈Ui ∩Uj, we obtain

(1.1.7)
To summarize, if the principal G-bundles P1 and P2 are vertically isomorphic, then
there exists a family of smooth mappings ρi : Ui →G such that their transition
mappings are related by (1.1.7).
It turns out that the converse is also true.
Theorem 1.1.11 Two principal G-bundles over M are vertically isomorphic iff there
exists a family of smooth mappings ρi : Ui →G such that the corresponding transi-
tion mappings fulﬁl (1.1.7).
Proof It remains to show that condition (1.1.7) implies that P1 and P2 are isomorphic.
Thus, let there be given a family of mappings {ρi}i∈I fulﬁlling (1.1.7). In the above
notation, we deﬁne
ϑi : π−1
1 (Ui) →π−1
2 (Ui),
ϑi :=

χ2
i
−1 ◦(idM ×ρi) ◦χ1

for every i ∈I. Obviously, this is a family of diffeomorphisms fulﬁlling π2(ϑi(p)) =
π1(p), p ∈π−1
1 (Ui). By (1.1.5), we have
χα
j ◦

χα

α = 1, 2.
Using this and condition (1.1.7), we obtain ϑi = ϑj on π−1
2 (Ui ∩Uj) for every pair
(i, j) such that Ui ∩Uj ̸= ∅. Thus, the family {ϑi}i∈I deﬁnes a diffeomorphism ϑ :
P1 →P2 fulﬁlling π2 ◦ϑ = π1. By (1.1.2), it also fulﬁls the equivariance property
(1.1.3). We conclude that ϑ is a vertical isomorphism of principal G-bundles.
■
Remark 1.1.12 ( ˇCech cohomology) The systems of mappings {ρi} and {ρij} are,
respectively, referred to as a 0-cocyle and a 1-cocyle on M with values in G, relative to
a chosen covering U = {Ui}i∈I. Formula (1.1.7) deﬁnes an equivalence relation in the
set of 1-cocycles. The corresponding set of equivalence classes H1
ˇC(U, G) is referred
to as the ﬁrst cohomology set H1
ˇC(U, G) in the sense of ˇCech, relative to a chosen
covering. The set of open coverings of M forms a directed system with respect to
reﬁnement, that is, U ≤V if each Vα ∈V is contained in some Ui ∈U. By restriction,
we get a mapping H1
ˇC(U, G) →H1
ˇC(V, G). The cohomology set H1
ˇC(M, G) is the
direct limit of the sets H1
ˇC(U, G) with respect to the restriction mappings, as U runs
through all open coverings of M, cf. [304] for further details.

Note that there is a distinguished element 1 ∈H1
ˇC(M, G), given by the constant
1-cocycle. More precisely, for any open covering, we put ρij(m) = 1 for every pair
(i, j). Note, however, that H1
ˇC(M, G) is in general not a group.
♦
Using this terminology, Theorem 1.1.11 can be reformulated as follows.
Corollary 1.1.13 The vertical isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles over M
are in one-one correspondence with the elements of the cohomology set H1
ˇC(M, G).
Thereby, the product bundle M × G corresponds to the distinguished element.

We close this section with a number of examples. All of them will be taken up again
later on.
Example 1.1.14 (Frame bundle of a manifold) Let M be an n-dimensional mani-
fold. A linear n-frame at m ∈M is an ordered basis u = (u1, . . . , un) of the tan-
gent space TmM. Let L(M) be the set of all linear n-frames on M. For an n-frame
u = (u1, . . . , un) at m ∈M and an element a = (aij) ∈GL(n, R), the ordered set
ua := ui aij is again an n-frame. Thus, we get a right action of GL(n, R) on L(M),
Ψ : L(M) × Gl(n, R),
Ψ (u, a) := ua,
which is obviously free. Clearly, the orbit space of this action is M and the corre-
sponding canonical projection π : L(M) →M coincides with the mapping which
assigns to an n-frame u at m ∈M the point m.
Let (U, ϕ) be a local chart of M. Then, on U, every basis vector ui belonging to
u = (u1, . . . , un) ∈π−1(U) can be represented by ui = (ui)ϕ,j∂ϕ
j , that is, locally u
is given by the matrix uϕ =

(ui)ϕ,j
∈Gl(n, R). Thus,
χ : π−1(U) →U × GL(n, R),
χ(u) := (π(p), uϕ)
(1.1.8)
is a bijection fulﬁlling prU ◦χ = π. By the deﬁnition of Ψ , it also fulﬁls the equivari-
ance property (1.1.2). We equip L(M) with a differentiable structure by postulating
that all the mappings (1.1.8) be diffeomorphisms. Then, (L(M), GL(n, R), M, Ψ, π)
is a principal ﬁbre bundle and the family of mappings (1.1.8) forms a system of local
trivializations.

Example 1.1.15 (Frame bundle of a vector bundle) Let E be a K-vector bundle of
rank k over M, where K = R, C or H. Let Lm be the set of bases in the ﬁbre Em.
Then,
L(E) :=

m∈M
Lm
carries the structure of a principal ﬁbre bundle over M with structure group GL(k, K).
The details are analogous to the previous example and are, therefore, left to the reader
(Exercise 1.1.5).

Deﬁnition 1.1.16 Let E be a K-vector bundle of rank k over M, where K = R, C or
H. We say that E is endowed with a ﬁbre metric h, if there exists a non-degenerate
inner product4 on each ﬁbre π−1(m) of E depending smoothly on m. The pair (E, h)
will be called (pseudo-)Riemannian for K = R and Hermitean for K = C or H.
Remark 1.1.17 Every vector bundle over a manifold admits a ﬁbre metric. This can
be easily shown using a partition of unity of the base manifold (Exercise 1.1.6).
Moreover, note that a ﬁbre metric in the tangent bundle of a manifold M is the same
as a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric on M.
♦
Example 1.1.18 For K = R, C or H, let E be a K-vector bundle of rank k over M
endowed with a ﬁbre metric h. Let Om be the set of h-orthonormal bases in the ﬁbre
Em. Then,
O(E) :=

m∈M
Om
carries the structure of a principal ﬁbre bundle over M with structure group being
the isometry group of the metric. Details are left to the reader (Exercise 1.1.5).
In the special case where K = R and E is the tangent bundle of an n-dimensional
Riemannian manifold M, this construction yields the orthonormal frame bundle
O(M) of M with the structure group O(n). If M is in addition oriented, the sub-
set O+(M) ⊂O(M) of ordered orthonormal frames is a reduction to the subgroup
SO(n) ⊂O(n).
As an example, consider M = Sn, realized as the unit sphere in Rn+1. Since for
x ∈Sn, the tangent space TxSn may be identiﬁed with the subspace of vectors in Rn+1
orthogonal to x, every orthonormal frame in TxSn complements x to an orthonormal
basis in Rn+1. Since every such basis corresponds to an orthogonal transformation,
we obtain a mapping O(Sn) →O(n + 1). We leave it to the reader to check that this
mapping is an isomorphism of principal O(n)-bundles, where O(n) acts on O(n + 1)
by right translation via the blockwise embedding O(n) →O(n + 1) deﬁned by the
decomposition Rn+1 = R ⊕Rn (Exercise 1.1.8). Clearly, this isomorphism restricts
to an isomorphism of principal SO(n)-bundles between O+(Sn) with respect to the
standard orientation (pointing outwards) and SO(n + 1).
♦
Deﬁnition 1.1.19 The principal bundle L(E) constructed in Example 1.1.15 is called
the frame bundle of E. The principal bundle O(E) constructed in Example 1.1.18 is
called the orthonormal frame bundle of E. More precisely, it is called the bundle of
orthogonal, unitary and symplectic frames for, respectively, K = R, C and H.
For the following two examples, the reader should recall the notion of projective
space, cf. Example I/1.1.15.
4In our convention, for K = C or H, the inner product is assumed to be anti-linear in the ﬁrst and
linear in the second component.

Example 1.1.20 (Complex Hopf bundle) Consider the natural free action of U(1) on
C2 given by
Ψ : C2 × U(1) →C2,
Ψ ((z1, z2), eiα) := (eiαz1, eiαz2).
Since the embedded submanifold
S3 = {(z1, z2) ∈C2 : |z1|2 + |z2|2 = 1}
is invariant under Ψ , we have an induced free action of U(1) on S3. Since the Lie
group U(1) is compact, this action is proper. Thus, by Corollary I/6.5.1, the orbit
space S3/U(1) admits a unique differentiable structure such that the canonical pro-
jection π : S3 →S3/U(1) is a submersion. According to Example I/6.5.4, the orbit
space endowed with this smooth structure coincides with the 1-dimensional complex
projective space CP1. Finally, the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem I/6.4.3 implies
the existence of local trivializations. Thus, the above action Ψ deﬁnes on S3 the
structure of a principal U(1)-bundle over CP1. This bundle is called the complex
Hopf bundle. For later purposes, we construct a system of local trivializations.
(a) Let U1 := CP1 \ {π(0, 1)}. Then, π−1(U1) = {(z1, z2) ∈S3 : z1 ̸= 0}. Thus, we
can deﬁne
χ1 : π−1(U1) →U1 × U(1),
χ1(z1, z2) :=

π(z1, z2), z1
|z1|

.
Then, κ1(z1, z2) =
z1
|z1|. Obviously, κ1 is smooth and U(1)-equivariant, that is,
κ1((z1eiα, z2eiα)) = z1
|z1|eiα.
Thus, χ1 is a local trivialization.
(b) Analogously, we put U2 := CP1 \ {π(1, 0)}. Then, π−1(U1) = {(z1, z2) ∈S3 :
z2 ̸= 0} and we deﬁne
χ2 : π−1(U2) →U2 × U(1),
χ2(z1, z2) :=

π(z1, z2), z2
|z2|

.
Thus, κ2(z1, z2) =
z2
|z2| and χ2 is also a local trivialization.
Since U1 ∪U2 = CP1, the collection {(Ui, χi)}i=1,2 deﬁnes a system of local
trivializations. Its transition mapping ρ12 : U1 ∩U2 →U(1) is given by
ρ12(π(z1, z2)) = κ1(z1, z2)κ2(z1, z2)−1 = z1

Remark 1.1.21
1. We show that CP1 is diffeomorphic to the 2-sphere. For that purpose, consider
the smooth mapping
S3 ∋(z1, z2) →(2z1z2, |z1|2 −|z2|2) ∈C × R.
Since
(|z1|2 −|z2|2)2 + |2z1z2|2 = (|z1|2 + |z2|2)2 = 1,
its image is contained in S2 ⊂C × R. Thus, it induces a smooth mapping f :
S3 →S2. Since f is U(1)-invariant, it induces a mapping ˜f : CP1 →S2. The
local triviality of the Hopf bundle implies that ˜f is smooth. It remains to show
that ˜f is invertible and that the inverse mapping is smooth. For that purpose, we
put V+ := S2 \ {(0, 1)} and deﬁne
g+ : V+ →C2,
g+(z, t) :=

z
√2(1 −t) ,
	
1 −t
2

.
Since the image of g+ is contained in S3, it induces a smooth mapping g+ : V+ →
S3. Composition with π then yields a smooth mapping ˜g+ := π ◦g : V+ →CP1.
We continue ˜g+ to a mapping ˜g : S2 →CP1 by setting ˜g(0, 1) := [(1, 0)]. Then,
˜g ◦˜f = idCP1 and ˜f ◦˜g = idS2, see Exercise 1.1.7. Thus, ˜g is inverse to ˜f . It
remains to show smoothness of ˜g at the point (0, 1). This is left to the reader, see
Exercise 1.1.7.
2. The Hopf bundle is clearly nontrivial, because otherwise S3 would have to be
diffeomorphic to S2 × U(1). This fact can be also read off from the transition
mappings as follows: it is enough to prove that ρ12 is not homotopic to the
constant mapping U1 ∩U2 ∋π(z1, z2) →1 ∈U(1). To show this, it is enough
to ﬁnd a continuous path t →γ (t) in U1 ∩U2 such that the path ρ12 ◦γ in U(1)
is not contractible to a point. We put
˜γ (t) :=
 1
√
2
e
1
2 it, 1
√
2
e−1
2 it

,
t ∈[0, 2π],
and γ (t) := π( ˜γ (t)). Clearly, γ is continuous and its image is contained in
U1 ∩U2. We have ρ12(γ (t)) = eit, with t running from 0 to 2π. Obviously, this
path is not contractible in U(1) showing that the Hopf bundle is nontrivial, indeed.
By construction, U1 ∩U2 is homeomorphic to S1 × (0, 1) and the path γ runs
through the S1-factor exactly once. Since ρ12 ◦γ also runs through U(1) ∼= S1
exactly once, the mapping degree of ρ12 is 1. Later on, we will see that the
mapping degree of the transition mapping yields a useful tool for the study of
isomorphism classes of principal bundles over spheres.

3. In complete analogy to the Hopf bundle, the natural action of U(1) on Cn yields
principal U(1)-bundles over the complex projective spaces CPn−1.5
♦
Example 1.1.22 (Quaternionic Hopf bundle) Recall the skew ﬁeld H of quaternions,
cf. Remark I/1.1.13. Consider the natural right action of the classical Lie group6 Sp(1)
of quaternions of norm 1 on H2,
Ψ : H2 × Sp(1) →H2,
Ψ ((q1, q2), u) = (q1u, q2u).
Clearly, Ψ is free and leaves the embedded submanifold
S7 = {(q1, q2) ∈H2 : ∥q1 ∥2 + ∥q2 ∥2= 1}
invariant. Thus, it induces a right free action on S7. Since Sp(1) is compact, this action
is proper. By the same arguments as in Example 1.1.20, the sphere S7 endowed with
the above action carries the structure of a principal Sp(1)-bundle over the quater-
nionic projective space HP1. This bundle is called the quaternionic Hopf bundle. By
Example I/5.1.10, the Lie group Sp(1) is isomorphic to the special unitary group
SU(2) and, by completely analogous arguments as in Remark 1.1.21/1, the base
manifold HP1 is diffeomorphic to S4 via the mapping (B.1). Thus, the quaternionic
Hopf bundle may be viewed as a principal SU(2)-bundle over S4. Let π : S7 →S4
be the canonical projection. Again, in complete analogy to the complex Hopf bun-
dle, one constructs a system of local trivializations {(Ui, χi)}i=1,2 as follows: take
U1 = HP1 \ {π(0, 1)} and U2 = HP1 \ {π(1, 0)} and deﬁne
χ1(q1, q2) :=

π(q1, q2),
q1
∥q1 ∥

π(q1, q2),

Remark 1.1.23
1. Using the criterion given in Remark 1.1.21/2, one can prove that the quaternionic
Hopf bundle is nontrivial (Exercise 1.1.9/c).
2. The construction of the quaternionic Hopf bundle obviously generalizes to the
case of the natural action of Sp(1) on Hn. This way one obtains a family of
principal Sp(1)-bundles with bundle space S4n−1 and base space HPn−1.
♦
Example 1.1.24 (Stiefel bundles) Recall from Example I/5.7.5 that the Stiefel mani-
fold SK(k, n), with K = R, C or H, is the set of k-frames in Kn which are orthonormal
with respect to the standard scalar product
⟨x, y⟩:=

i=1
xiyi.
5Sometimes, they are also called Hopf bundles.
6For the terminology, see Example I/1.2.6.

1.1 Principal Bundles
13
As shown there, SK(k, n) aquires its manifold structure by identifying it with the
homogeneous space obtained by taking the quotient of the isometry group UK(n) of
the scalar product with respect to the stabilizer UK(n −k) of a chosen frame, that is,
SK(k, n) ∼= UK(n)/UK(n −k).
(1.1.10)
Here,
UK(n) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
O(n)
if K = R,
U(n)
if K = C,
Sp(n) if K = H.
Correspondingly, consider the Graßmann manifold GK(k, n), which is the set of
k-dimensional subspaces of Kn, cf. Example I/5.7.6. One has
GK(k, n) ∼= UK(n)/(UK(n −k) × UK(k)).
(1.1.11)
Clearly, UK(k) acts smoothly on SK(k, n). By Corollary I/6.5.3, this action is free and
proper. Thus, by the arguments given in Remark 1.1.2, SK(k, n) carries the structure
of a principal ﬁbre bundle over GK(k, n) with structure group UK(k). The principal
bundlessoobtainedarecalled,respectively,thereal,complexandquaternionicStiefel

♦
Remark 1.1.25 Consider the special case SK(1, n). Then, one has the following dif-
feomorphisms (Exercise 1.1.10):
SK(1, n) ∼= Sdn−1,
GK(1, n) ∼= KPn−1,
(1.1.12)
with d = dimR K. Thus, Sn−1, S2n−1 and S4n−1 carry the structure of principal ﬁbre
bundles with structure groups O(1), U(1) and Sp(1) and base spaces RPn−1, CPn−1
and HPn−1, respectively. They are isomorphic to the real, complex and quaternionic
Stiefel bundles with k = 1, respectively. In particular, the Hopf bundles of Examples
1.1.20 and 1.1.22 coincide with the Stiefel bundles SK(1, 2) with K = C and K = H,
respectively.

Example 1.1.26 (Universal Covering) Consider the universal covering space ˜M of
a manifold M. Then, ˜M is a principal ﬁbre bundle over M whose (discrete) structure
group is the ﬁrst homotopy group π1(M) (Exercise 1.1.12).

Associated Bundles
First, we recall the notion of associated bundle from Sect.6.5 in Part I. Let
(P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle and let (F, G, σ) be a left Lie group action.
Let ˇσ be the right action associated with σ,
ˇσ : F × G →F,
(f , a) →ˇσa(f ) := σa−1(f ).
Since the G-action Ψ on P is free, the direct product action Ψ × ˇσ is free, too.
According to Remark I/6.3.9/2, it is proper. Thus, by Corollary I/6.5.1, the orbit
space

1.2 Associated Bundles
15
P ×G F := (P × F)/G
inherits a unique smooth structure. Since the natural projection P × F →P is
equivariant, it induces a smooth surjective mapping
πF : P ×G F →P/G = M,
πF([(p, f )]) = π(p) .
This endows P ×G F with a natural bundle structure. Finally, the local triviality of P
induces the local triviality of this bundle. To see this, recall from Proposition 1.1.6
that (local) trivializations of P are in one-to-one correspondence with (local) sections.
Thus, let s : U →P be a local section corresponding to a local trivialization (U, χ)
of P. Then, the mapping
U × F →π−1
F (U),
(m, f ) →[(s(m), f )]
is a diffeomorphism projecting to the identical mapping on U. The inverse map-
ping ξ : π−1
F (U) →U × F yields a local trivialization of P ×G F. Thus, we have
constructed a ﬁbre bundle over M with typical ﬁbre F.
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 The ﬁbre bundle (P ×G F, M, πF) is said to be associated with the
principal bundle (P, G, M, Ψ, π) and the G-manifold (F, σ).
The proof of the following observation is left to the reader (Exercise 1.2.1).
Proposition 1.2.2 For given principal bundles P1(M1, G1) and P2(M2, G2) and rep-
resentations (F1, G1, σ1) and (F2, G2, σ2), let (ϑ, λ) be a morphism from P1 to P2 and
let T : F1 →F2 be a homomorphism of the representations σ1 and σ2. Then, ϑ × T :
P1 × F1 →P2 × F2 induces a vector bundle morphism P1 ×G1 F1 →P2 ×G2 F2
projecting to ˜ϑ.
■
This proposition applies, in particular, to the case where F1 = F2 and T = id.
Remark 1.2.3
1. Let us express the local trivialization (U, ξ) constructed above explicitly in terms
of the local trivialization (U, χ). As usual, denote κ = prG ◦χ and let s be the
associated local section of P. Recall that, for any p ∈π−1(U), we have p =
Ψκ(p)s(π(p)). Using this, we calculate
ξ([(p, f )]) = ξ([(Ψκ(p)s(m), f )]) = ξ([(s(m), σκ(p)f )]) = (m, σκ(p)f ),
with m = π(p). Since π(p) = πF([(p, f )]), we obtain
ξ([(p, f )]) = (πF([(p, f )]), σκ(p)f ).
(1.2.1)
2. The natural projection ι : P × F →P ×G F induces for every p ∈P a mapping

16
1
Fibre Bundles and Connections
ιp : F →P ×G F,
ιp(f ) := [(p, f )]
(1.2.2)
whose image is contained in the ﬁbre over π(p). Moreover, since
ιΨa(p)(f ) = [(Ψa(p), f )] = [(Ψa(p), σa−1 ◦σa(f ))] = [(p, σa(f ))],
ιp is equivariant,
ιΨa(p) = ιp ◦σa.
(1.2.3)
From these properties it is clear that, viewed as a mapping from F to the ﬁbre
over π(p), ιp is bijective. Finally, from (1.2.1) we read off
pr2 ◦ξ ◦ιp = σκ(p),
(1.2.4)
for any local trivialization (U, ξ) such that π(p) ∈U. Since this is a diffeomor-
phism of F, we conclude that ιp is a diffeomorphism identifying F with the ﬁbre
π−1
F (π(p)).
3. Let {(Ui, χi)} be a system of local trivializations of P and let {ρij} be the corre-
sponding system of transition mappings. Let {(Ui, ξi)} be the induced system of
local trivializations of P ×G F. Let us ﬁnd the corresponding system of transition
mappings. For m ∈Ui ∩Uj, f ∈F and p ∈π−1(m), we calculate
ξi ◦ξ −1
j
(m, f ) = ξi([(p, σκj(p)−1(f ))]) = (m, σκi(p) ◦σκj(p)−1(f )).
Since ρij(m) = κi(p)κj(p)−1, we obtain
ξi ◦ξ −1
j
(m, f ) = (m, σρij(m)(f )),
(1.2.5)
that is, the transition mappings of P ×G F are given by σρij : Ui ∩Uj →Diff(F).
Then, in complete analogy to Proposition 1.1.10, one can reconstruct P ×G F
from the transition mappings σρij.
♦
Example 1.2.4
1. Let P(M, G) be a principal ﬁbre bundle and let H ⊂G be a closed subgroup.
Then, by Theorem I/5.6.8, H is an embedded Lie subgroup of G. Consider the
action of G on the homogeneous space G/H by left translation. Then, P ×G G/H
is an associated bundle over M with typical ﬁbre being a transitive G-manifold.
One can show the following, see Exercise 1.2.2:
(a) As a ﬁbre bundle over M, the associated bundle P ×G G/H is isomorphic to
the quotient P/H, endowed with the natural ﬁbre bundle structure induced
from P.
(b) P may be viewed as a principal H-bundle over P ×G G/H.
2. Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle, let E = P ×G F be an associated bundle and
let ϕ : N →M be a smooth mapping of manifolds. Consider the pullback bundle

(y, [(p, f )]) →[((y, p), f )]
(1.2.6)
is well deﬁned and an isomorphism of ﬁbre bundles (Exercise 1.2.3). Thus, ϕ∗E
is naturally associated with ϕ∗P.
3. Consider the ﬁbre product P1 ×M P2 of two principal bundles P1(M, G1) and
P2(M, G2), cf. Remark 1.1.9/2. Let (Fi, Gi, σi), i = 1, 2, be Lie group represen-
tations and let Ei = Pi ×Gi Fi be associated vector bundles. Taking the tensor
product representation σ1 ⊗σ2 : G1 × G2 →Aut(F1 ⊗F2) of G1 × G2, deﬁned
by
(σ1 ⊗σ2)(g1,g2) (f1 ⊗f2) := (σ1)g1(f1) ⊗(σ2)g2(f2),
(1.2.7)
we can build the associated bundle (P1 × P2) ×(G1×G2) (F1 ⊗F2) over M × M.
We take the pullback of this bundle under the diagonal mapping
Δ : M →M × M.
Using point 2, we obtain
Δ∗
(P1 × P2) ×(G1×G2) (F1 ⊗F2)

= (P1 ×M P2) ×(G1×G2) (F1 ⊗F2).
It is easy to show that this bundle is isomorphic to the tensor product E1 ⊗E2
(Exercise 1.2.4), that is, E1 ⊗E2 is naturally associated with the ﬁbre product
P1 ×M P2. Moreover, one can prove [472] that every ﬁnite-dimensional irre-
ducible representation of G1 × G2 is equivalent to the tensor product of irre-
ducible representations of G1 and G2, that is, by the above construction we exhaust
all ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible representations of G1 × G2.
♦
Let P be a principal G-bundle over M and let λ : G →H be a Lie group homo-
morphism. Consider the associated bundle
P[λ] := P ×G H,
(1.2.8)
where G acts on H by left translations via λ. Since left and right translations on
H commute, the action of H on P × H by right translation on the second factor
descends to a free right action of H on P[λ]. Clearly, this action turns P[λ] into a
principal H-bundle over M, called the principal H-bundle associated with P via λ.
The proof of the following proposition is left to the reader (Exercise 1.2.5).

3. For i = 1, 2, let Gi and Hi be Lie groups and let λi : Gi →Hi be Lie group
homomorphisms. By restriction, the rearrangement
(P1 × P2) × (H1 × H2) →(P1 × H1) × (P2 × H2)
induces a vertical isomorphism (P1 × P2)[λ1×λ2] ∼= P1[λ1] × P2[λ2].

Next, we study the structure of the set of smooth sections Γ ∞(P ×G F). For that
purpose, let HomG(P, F) be the set of smooth equivariant mappings ˜Φ : P →F,
˜Φ ◦Ψa = σa−1 ◦˜Φ .
(1.2.9)
Proposition 1.2.6 For every ˜Φ ∈HomG(P, F), there exists a unique element Φ ∈

Φ(m) := [(p, ˜Φ(p))],
(1.2.11)
where p ∈π−1(m). This is a well-deﬁned section of P ×G F, because the equivari-
ance property (1.2.9) implies

Φ(m) = [(p, ˜Φ(p))] = ιp ˜Φ(p),
˜Φ can be uniquely reconstructed from Φ.

Proposition 1.2.6 applies, in particular, to the case where F = Q is a principal G-
bundle7 and thus yields a bijective correspondence between morphisms P →Q of
principal G-bundles and sections of P ×G Q. In the special case where P and Q have
the same base manifold M, this correspondence can be reﬁned to describe vertical
morphisms as follows. The direct product mapping πP × πQ : P × Q →M × M
deﬁned by the projections πP : P →M and πQ : Q →M descends to a surjective
submersion
πP ×G πQ : P ×G Q →M × M .
(1.2.12)
This is a ﬁbre bundle with typical ﬁbre G: given local trivializations (UP, χP) of P

ﬁbre bundle (1.2.12) to the diagonal M ⊂M × M. Then, P ×G,M Q is an embedded
submanifold of P ×G Q and the induced projection P ×G,M Q →M coincides with
the restriction of the associated bundle projection P ×G Q →M to this submanifold.
Thus, P ×G,M Q is an embedded vertical subbundle of the associated bundle P ×G Q.
Corollary 1.2.7 By restriction, the bijection between G-morphisms P →Q and
sections of the associated bundle P ×G Q induces a bijection between vertical G-
morphisms P →Q and sections of the vertical subbundle P ×G,M Q.
Proof Let ϑ : P →Q be a G-morphism. Proposition 1.2.6 assigns to ϑ a section s
of P ×G Q via s(m) = [

P (m). We compute
(πP ×G πQ) ◦s(m) =

Thus, ˜ϑ = idM iff s takes values in the submanifold P ×G,M Q ⊂P ×G Q, and hence
is a section in the vertical subbundle P ×G,M Q.

For the remainder of this section, we assume that F is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector
space carrying a representation of the structure group G.
Proposition 1.2.8 Let P(M, G) be a principal G-bundle and let (F, G, σ) be a Lie
group representation. Then,
1. the associated bundle P ×G F is a vector bundle,
2. the bijection between HomG(P, F) and Γ ∞(P ×G F) given by Proposition 1.2.6
is an isomorphism of vector spaces.
3. If ϑ : P1 →P2 is a morphism of principal G-bundles with projection ˜ϑ, then the
mapping
P1 ×G F →P2 ×G F,
[(p, f )] →

ϑ(p), f

is a morphism of vector bundles with projection ˜ϑ.
4. If f : N →M is a smooth mapping, then the induced mapping


m, [(p, f )]

→

(m, p), f

is a vertical vector bundle isomorphism.
Proof 1. We endow the ﬁbres of P ×G F with a vector space structure by requiring
that the diffeomorphisms ιp be linear (and thus vector space isomorphisms) for all p ∈
P. Since the mappings σa are vector space automorphisms, formula (1.2.3) implies
that for every pair of points p, p′ belonging to the same ﬁbre, ιp′ is linear iff ιp is
linear. Thus, this vector space structure is well deﬁned. Now, let (U, χ) be a local
trivialization of P, let s be the corresponding local section of P and let (U, ξ) be the
corresponding local trivialization of P ×G F. We have to show that, with respect to
the above deﬁned linear structure, the induced mappings
pr2 ◦ξ↾π−1
F
(m) : π−1
F (m) →F,
m ∈U,
are linear. Using (1.2.4) and κ(s(m)) = 1, we obtain
pr2 ◦ξ ◦ιs(m)(f ) = σκ(s(m))(f ) = f .
Thus, pr2 ◦ξ↾π−1
F
(m) = ι−1
s(m) and the assertion follows.
2. This is an immediate consequence of the linearity of ιp.
3 and 4. This is analogous to points 1 and 2 of Proposition 1.2.5.
■
Remark 1.2.9
1. By deﬁnition of ιp, the linear structure on the ﬁbre through [(p, f )] ∈P ×G F is
given as follows:
λ1[(p, f1)] + λ2[(p, f2)] = [(p, λ1f1 + λ2f2)],
λ1, λ2 ∈R.

1.2 Associated Bundles
21
Thus, to calculate the sum of two elements one has to choose representatives with
the same p.
2. Let E be a K-vector bundle of rank k over M, where K = R, C or H, and let
L(E) be its principal GL(k, K)-bundle of linear frames, cf. Example1.1.15. Let
Lm be the set of bases sm = (s1, . . . , sk) in the ﬁbre Em. Clearly, the vector bundle
E is associated with L(E), that is, there exists a vector bundle isomorphism
L(E) ×GL(k,K) Kk ∼= E, given by
[((s1, . . . , sk), x)] →
k

i=1
xisi.
This shows that any vector bundle may be viewed as a bundle associated with a
principal bundle. If E carries a ﬁbre metric, we have an analogous isomorphism
between E and the bundle O(E) ×UK(k) Kk associated with the orthonormal frame
bundle O(E), cf. Deﬁnition 1.1.19, via the standard representation of UK(k) on
Kk.
♦
In the sequel, we denote E = P ×G F. Since E is a vector bundle, we can form the
tensor product k(T∗M) ⊗E and we may consider sections of this bundle.
Deﬁnition 1.2.10 A section in k(T∗M) ⊗E is called a differential k-form on M
with values in E. The vector space of these sections will be denoted by Ωk(M, E).
Since 0(T∗M) = M × R and (M × R) ⊗E = E, we may identify Ω0(M, E) with
Γ ∞(E). In analogy to the case of sections, elements of Ωk(M, E) may be viewed as
differential forms on P.
Deﬁnition 1.2.11 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle and let (F, G, σ) be a ﬁnite-
dimensional representation of G. A differential k-form ˜α on P with values in F is
called horizontal of type σ if it is annihilated by any vector tangent to the ﬁbres and
if it fulﬁls
Ψ ∗
a ˜α = σa−1 ◦˜α
for every a ∈G. The vector space of horizontal k-forms of type σ will be denoted
by Ωk
σ,hor(P, F).
Correspondingly, the space of ordinary horizontal differential k-forms on P will be
denoted by Ωk
hor(P).
Proposition 1.2.12 To every element ˜α ∈Ωk

αm(X1, . . . , Xk) := ιp ◦˜αp(Y1, . . . , Yk).
(1.2.13)
We must show that this deﬁnition does neither depend on the choice of p nor on the
choice of the Yi. Thus, take p′ = Ψa(p) and tangent vectors Y ′
i at p′ which also project
onto the Xi. Then, there exist vertical vectors Zi ∈Tp′P such that Y ′

This is a k-form on U with values in F. The following proposition shows that a
horizontal form of type σ may be reconstructed from its local representatives.
Proposition 1.2.14 Let ˜α ∈Ωk
σ,hor(P, F) and let ˜αχ be its representative in a local

˜αp = σκ(p)−1 ◦(π∗˜αχ)p.
(1.2.16)

Thus, using the horizontality of ˜α, in the above formula we may replace the tangent

κ(p)−1(Yi) by s′ ◦π′(Yi). This yields
σκ(p) ◦˜αp(Y1, . . . , Yk) = ˜αs(π(p)) (s′ ◦π′(Y1), . . . , s′ ◦π′(Yk))
= (π∗(s∗˜α))p(Y1, . . . , Yk),
and, thus, the assertion.

Remark 1.2.15
1. Let {(Ui, χi)}i∈I be a system of local trivializations of P and let (Uj, χj) and

2. Let α be the k-form on M with values in E corresponding to ˜α and let (U, ξ) be
the local trivialization of E induced by (U, χ) via (1.2.1). We deﬁne the local
representative of α by
αξ = pr2 ◦ξ ◦α↾U.

Connections
The notion of connection will play a fundamental role throughout this book, because
it yields the mathematical model for a gauge potential.
To start with, we recall the notion of Killing vector ﬁeld, cf. Sect.6.2 of Part I.
Given a Lie group action (P, G, Ψ ), every element A of the Lie algebra g of G deﬁnes
a vector ﬁeld A∗via the ﬂow Ψexp(tA), that is,
(A∗)p = d
dt ↾0
Ψexp(tA)(p) = Ψ ′
p(A) .
A∗is called the Killing vector ﬁeld generated by A.

1.3 Connections
25
Now, consider a principal ﬁbre bundle (P, G, M, Ψ, π). We denote the vertical
distribution spanned by the Killing vector ﬁelds of the G-action by V and call Vp ⊂
TpP the vertical subspace of TpP at p ∈P.
Lemma 1.3.1 The vertical distribution V has the following properties.
1. It is equivariant, that is, VΨa(p) = Ψ ′
a(Vp).
2. The mapping
ψ : P × g →V,
(p, A) →Ψ ′
p(A)
is an isomorphism of vector bundles. In particular, the mappings Ψ ′
p : g →Vp
are isomorphisms of vector spaces.
3. For every p ∈P, the vertical subspace Vp coincides with the tangent space of the
ﬁbre at p and, thus, with ker(π′
p).
Proof 1. This follows from Proposition I/6.2.2/1.
2. By construction, ψ is a surjective vertical morphism of vector bundles. Since
Ψ is a free action, Proposition I/6.2.2/3 implies that ψ is injective. Thus, the tangent
mapping ψ′ is bijective at any point and, consequently, the Inverse Mapping Theorem
I/1.5.7 implies that the inverse mapping is smooth.
3. This is an immediate consequence of the Orbit Theorem I/6.2.8.
■
Since, by deﬁnition, V is spanned by the Killing vector ﬁelds, to prove VΨa(p) =
Ψ ′
a(Vp) it is enough to study the transport of a Killing vector ﬁeld under Ψ . One ﬁnds

(1.3.1)
Also note that, by point 2 of Lemma 1.3.1, as a vector bundle, V is trivial.
Now, we can deﬁne the notion of connection.
Deﬁnition 1.3.2 (Connection on a principal ﬁbre bundle) Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a
principal ﬁbre bundle. A connection on P is a distribution9 Γ on P such that
1. Γp ⊕Vp = TpP for all p ∈P,
2. ΓΨa(p) = Ψ ′
a(Γp) for all p ∈P and a ∈G.
Γp is called the horizontal subspace at p.
A connection on a principal bundle will be often referred to as a principal connection.
Remark 1.3.3
1. By point 1, every tangent vector Xp ∈TpP admits a unique decomposition into a
horizontal component hor Xp ∈Γp and a vertical component ver Xp ∈Vp,
Xp = hor Xp + ver Xp.
(1.3.2)
9As in Part I, distributions are assumed to be smooth without notice.

Fibre Bundles and Connections
Since both Γ and V are smooth, the mappings hor : TP →Γ and ver : TP →V
are smooth. Thus, if X is a smooth vector ﬁeld on P, then both hor X and ver X
are smooth vector ﬁelds, too.
2. For a given connection Γ , the restriction of π′ to the horizontal subspace Γp
yields an isomorphism of Γp and Tπ(p)M. Thus, every vector ﬁeld X on M admits
a unique horizontal lift, that is, a vector ﬁeld Xh on P with values in the horizontal
distribution which is π-related to X. It is obtained by applying the inverse of the
above isomorphism pointwise to X. By construction, Xh is Ψ -invariant. The proof
of smoothness of Xh is left to the reader (Exercise 1.3.1). Conversely, every Ψ -
invariant horizontal vector ﬁeld on P is the horizontal lift of a vector ﬁeld on
M.
3. Every connection on a principal bundle P induces a connection on any bundle
associated with P. Indeed, let Γ be a connection on the principal bundle P(M, G)
and let E = P ×G F be an associated bundle. For f ∈F, we deﬁne
ιf : P →E,
ιf (p) = [(p, f )].
This mapping has the following properties:
ιf ◦Ψa = ισa(f ),
πF ◦ιf = π.
(1.3.3)
The horizontal subspace at e = [(p, f )] ∈E is deﬁned by
Γ E
e := ι′
f (Γp).
(1.3.4)
By the ﬁrst relation in (1.3.3), the right hand side of this equation does not depend
on the choice of the representative (p, f ) of e. Since p →Γp is a smooth distribu-
tion, e →Γ E
e is smooth, too. We show that this distribution is complementary to
the canonical vertical distribution e →V E
e , where V E
e denotes the tangent space
to the ﬁbre at e ∈E. By the second equation in (1.3.3), ι′
f (Vp) is contained in V E
e
and π′
F(Γ E
e ) = π′(Γp) = TmM, where m = πF(e). Thus, we have a direct sum
decomposition,
TeE = V E
e ⊕Γ E
e .
The horizontal distribution e →Γ E
e will be referred to as the connection on E
induced by Γ . In particular, the restriction of the tangent mapping π′
F to Γ E
e
deﬁnes an isomorphism from Γ E
e onto TmM and, thus, every tangent vector X ∈
TmM admits a unique horizontal lift Xh
e ∈Γ E
e . By (1.3.4), it is given by
Xh
e = ι′
f (Xh
p),
(1.3.5)
where Xh
p is the unique horizontal lift of X to the point p of P.

Since, by point 2 of Lemma 1.3.1, Ψ ′
p : g →Vp is a vector space isomorphism, with
every connection we may associate a g-valued 1-form on P.
Deﬁnition 1.3.4 (Connection form) Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle and
let Γ be a connection on P. The 1-form ω on P with values in g deﬁned by
ωp(X) := (Ψ ′
p)−1(ver X),
p ∈P , X ∈TpP,
(1.3.6)
is called the connection form of Γ .
As an immediate consequence of this deﬁnition, we obtain the following formula of
the horizontal component of a tangent vector X ∈TpP:
hor X = X −Ψ ′
p(ω(X)).
(1.3.7)
Proposition 1.3.5 Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle and let Γ be a con-
nection on P. Then, the connection form ω of Γ is smooth and has the following
properties.

Proposition 1.3.6 Every g-valued 1-form ω on P fulﬁlling the conditions 2 and 3 of
Proposition 1.3.5 uniquely deﬁnes a connection Γ .

Proposition 1.3.7 Every principal ﬁbre bundle admits a connection.
Proof Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal ﬁbre bundle, let {Ui}i∈I be a countable,
locally ﬁnite covering of M and let {fi}i∈I be a subordinate partition of unity. Choose
a system of local trivializations {(Ui, χi)}i∈I of P, associated with this covering. At
every point χ−1
i
(m, 1), m ∈M, we deﬁne a subspace Γχ−1

Clearly, Γχ−1
i
(m,1) is complementary to Vχ−1
i
(m,1). If we transport this subspace with
Ψ ′
a, a ∈G, to the remaining points of the ﬁbre over m, for every m ∈Ui, then we
obtain a connection on the trivial principal G-bundle π−1(Ui). Let us denote the
corresponding connection form by ˜ωi. We deﬁne the following family of g-valued
1-forms on P:
(ωi)p :=

0
p /∈π−1(Ui)
(π∗fi) ˜ωi
p ∈π−1(Ui) .
Since {supp(fi)} is locally ﬁnite, ω := 
i ωi is a well-deﬁned smooth 1-form on P
with values in g. It remains to show that ω fulﬁls conditions 2 and 3 of Proposition
1.3.5.
Condition 2. For p ∈P and A ∈g, we have
ωp(A∗(p)) =

i∈I
(ωi)p(A∗(p)) =

i∈I∗
(ωi)p(A∗(p)) ,
where I∗⊂I contains exactly those indices for which π(p) ∈Ui. Since every ˜ωi is
a connection form, for i ∈I∗, we obtain
(ωi)p(A∗(p)) = fi(π(p))( ˜ωi)p(A∗(p)) = fi(π(p))A.
Now, 
i∈I∗fi(π(p)) = 
i∈I fi(π(p)) = 1 implies ωp(A∗(p)) = A .
Condition 3. It is enough to verify this condition for every ωi restricted to π−1(Ui).
Since Ψ ∗

Remark 1.3.8 Bythedeﬁningproperties2and3ofaconnectionform,cf.Proposition
1.3.5, the difference of two connection forms is a horizontal 1-form of type Ad. Thus,
the set of connections of a principal ﬁbre bundle carries the structure of an inﬁnite-
dimensional afﬁne space with the translation vector space given by Ω1
Ad,hor(P, g).
This space will play a crucial role in gauge theory.
♦
Remark 1.3.9 By Remark 1.3.3/3, a principal connection Γ induces a connection Γ E
on every associated bundle E = P ×G F. If (F, G, σ) is a Lie group representation
and, thus, E is a vector bundle, then the canonical vertical subspace V E
e may be
naturally identiﬁed with the ﬁbre through e ∈E. In more detail, since in this case the
mapping ιp, given by (1.2.2), is a vector space isomorphism between F and the ﬁbre
EπF(p), the tangent mapping ι′
p is a vector space isomorphism between Tf F ∼= F and
V E
e , where e = [(p, f )]. Thus, for any Z ∈V E
e , there exists an element v ∈F such
that Z = ι′
p(v). Via ιp, the vector v may be identiﬁed with the element [(p, v)] in the
ﬁbre EπF(p). Thus, the above mentioned identiﬁcation is given by
V E
e →E,
Z →ιp ◦(ι′
p)−1(Z) .

1.3 Connections

We conclude that in the case of an associated vector bundle E, endowed with an
induced connection Γ E, we have an analogue of the connection form ω:
ωE : TE →E,
ωE(X) := ιp ◦(ι′
p)−1(Xv),
(1.3.9)
where X = Xv + Xh is the decomposition of X ∈TeE with respect to Γ E. Clearly,
ωE is a vector bundle morphism. It is called the connection mapping induced from
ω. Using ιf ◦Ψp = ιp ◦σf , one easily ﬁnds the following relation between ω and ωE
(Exercise 1.3.3):
ωE ◦ι′
f (X) = ιp ◦σ ′(ω(X))f ,
X ∈TpP.
(1.3.10)
Here, σ ′ ≡dσ : g →End(F) is the representation of the Lie algebra g of G induced
from σ. The assignment X →σ ′(ω(X)) deﬁnes a 1-form on P with values in End(F)
which will be denoted by σ ′(ω).
♦
It turns out that a connection on P(M, G) is uniquely characterized in terms of its
local representatives on the base space M. Let s: U →π−1(U) be a local section.
The local representative of a connection form ω on P is deﬁned by
A := s∗ω.
(1.3.11)
Remark 1.3.10 Let (U, ϕ) be a local chart on M and let {ta} be a basis in g. Then,
the collection
{dϕμ1 ∧· · · ∧dϕμk ⊗ta}
(1.3.12)
yields a local frame in the bundle of g-valued k-forms on M. With respect to this
frame, the local representative A takes the form
A = A a
μ dϕμ ⊗ta.
♦
We show that ω may be reconstructed from A locally. For that purpose, recall
from the proof of Proposition 1.1.6 that a section s deﬁnes an equivariant mapping
κ : P →G by
Ψκ(p)(s ◦π(p)) = p,
p ∈P.
(1.3.13)
Proposition 1.3.11 Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle and let ω be a con-
nection form on P. Let U ⊂M be open and let s : U →π−1(U) be a local section.
Let A be the local representative deﬁned by (1.3.11). Then, for every p ∈π−1(U),

Next, let us discuss the transformation properties of connections under principal
bundle morphisms.
Proposition 1.3.13 Let (ϑ, λ) be a morphism of the principal bundles P1(M1, G1)
and P2(M2, G2) such that the induced mapping ˜ϑ : M1 →M2 is a diffeomorphism.
Let Γ 1 be a connection on P1 and let ω1 be its connection form.
1. There exists a unique connection Γ 2 on P2 such that ϑ′ maps horizontal subspaces
of Γ 1 to horizontal subspaces of Γ 2.
2. The connection form ω2 of Γ 2 fulﬁls ϑ∗ω2 = dλ ◦ω1, where dλ : g1 →g2 is the
induced homomorphism of Lie algebras. Moreover, ϑ∗Ω2 = dλ ◦Ω1.
We call Γ 2 the image of Γ 1 under the morphism (ϑ, λ).11
Proof Denote the right group actions and the canonical projections in Pi, i = 1, 2,
by Ψ i and πi, respectively.
1. We deﬁne a distribution Γ 2 on P2 as follows. Since ˜ϑ is surjective, for a
given p2 ∈P2, we can choose a pair (p1, a) ∈P1 × G2 such that p2 = Ψ 2
a (ϑ(p1))
and deﬁne
Γ 2
p2 :=


,
where Γ 1
p1 is the horizontal subspace of Γ 1 at p1. By (1.1.3), this deﬁnition does not
depend on the choice of the pair (p1, a). We prove that Γ 2 is a connection on P2.
First, we calculate

Ψ 2
b (p2),
because Ψ 2
b (p2) = Ψ 2
ab(ϑ(p1)). Thus, Γ 2 is G2-equivariant. To prove that Γ 2 is com-
plementary to the vertical distribution V 2 on P2, by local triviality of the bundles,
it is enough to show that the restriction of π′
2 : TP2 →TM2 to Γ 2 yields pointwise
isomorphisms of vector spaces. Thus, consider the mapping π′
2 : Γ 2
p2 →Tπ2(p2)M2.
By G-equivariance of Γ 2, we may assume p2 = ϑ(p1). Then, from ˜ϑ ◦π1 = π2 ◦ϑ,
we have
˜ϑ′
π1(p1) ◦(π1)′
p1 = (π2)′
p2 ◦ϑ′
p1.
Since, by assumption, ˜ϑ is a diffeomorphism and Γ 1 is a connection, ˜ϑ′ and π′
1 are
both isomorphisms of vector spaces. Thus, π′
2 : Γ 2
p2 →Tπ2(p2)M2 is an isomorphism,
too. We conclude that Γ 2 is a connection. By construction, it is unique.

for any p1 ∈P1 and X ∈Tp1P1. Since ϑ′ maps horizontal vectors to horizontal vec-
tors, it is enough to prove this equality for vertical vectors, that is, for values of
Killing vector ﬁelds. Thus, let A∗be the Killing vector ﬁeld generated by A ∈g1.
Since, for any a ∈G1,
ϑ ◦Ψ 1
p1(a) = ϑ ◦Ψ 1
a (p1) = Ψ 2
λ(a) ◦ϑ(p1) = Ψ 2

Proposition 1.3.13 immediately implies the following.
Corollary 1.3.14 For a Lie group homomorphism λ : H →G and a principal H-
bundle Q, let P := Q[λ]. Then, any connection Γ Q on Q induces a unique connection
Γ P on P. The corresponding connection forms are related via
ϑ∗ωP = dλ ◦ωQ,
where ϑ : Q →P is the corresponding bundle morphism.
■
The induced connection Γ P is often referred to as the λ-extension of Γ Q.
Since the proof of the following proposition is by arguments similar to those in
the proof of Proposition 1.3.13, we leave it to the reader, see Exercise 1.3.5.
Proposition 1.3.15 Let (ϑ, λ) be a morphism of the principal bundles P1(M1, G1)
and P2(M2, G2) such that λ : G1 →G2 is an isomorphism. Let Γ 2 be a connection
on P2 and let ω2 be its connection form.
1. There exists a unique connection Γ 1 on P1 such that ϑ′ maps horizontal subspaces
of Γ 1 to horizontal subspaces of Γ 2.
2. The connection form ω1 of Γ 1 fulﬁls ϑ∗ω2 = dλ ◦ω1 and ϑ∗Ω2 = dλ ◦Ω1.

1.3 Connections
33
We call Γ 1 the connection induced by Γ 2 via the morphism (ϑ, λ).
Corollary 1.3.16 UndertheassumptionsofProposition1.3.15,additionally,assume
G1 = G2 = G and let λ be the identical automorphism. Then, ω1 = ϑ∗ω2. This
means, in particular:
1. The pullback of a connection form under an automorphism of a principal bundle
is a connection form.
2. For a principal bundle P(M, G) and a mapping f : N →M, every connction in
P induces a connection on the pullback bundle f ∗P.
■
Remark 1.3.17
1. Proposition 1.3.13 remains true under the weaker assumptions that ˜ϑ be a sur-
jective submersion and that M1 and M2 have the same dimension. Similarly, in
Proposition 1.3.15, it sufﬁces to assume that dλ be an isomorphism of Lie alge-
bras.
2. From the proof of Proposition 1.3.13 we read off the following. Let (ϑ, λ) be a
morphism of the principal bundles P1(M1, G1) and P2(M2, G2). For i = 1, 2, let
ωi be a connection form on Pi and let Ωi be its curvature form. If ϑ∗ω2 = dλ ◦ω1,
then ϑ∗Ω2 = dλ ◦Ω1.
3. Consider the special case of the ﬁbre product bundle P1 ×M P2 = Δ∗(P1 × P2),
cf. Remark 1.1.9/2. Let (πi, λi) : P1 ×M P2 →Pi, i = 1, 2, be the natural prin-
cipal bundle homomorphisms deﬁned by restriction of the canonical projections
pri : P1 × P2 →Pi to P1 ×M P2. The corresponding Lie group homomorphisms
λi : G1 × G2 →Gi are given by the canonical projections onto the ﬁrst and the
second component, respectively. Let Γ1 and Γ2 be connections on P1 and P2,
respectively, and let ω1 and ω2 be the corresponding connection forms. Then,
ω = pr∗
1 ω1 + pr∗
2 ω2
is obviously a connection form on P1 × P2.12 Now, by Corollary 1.3.16, ϑ∗ω
is the unique connection on Δ∗(P1 × P2) = P1 ×M P2 induced from ω, where
ϑ : P1 ×M P2 →P1 × P2 is the induced morphism. It is given by
ϑ∗ω = π∗
1 ω1 + π∗
2 ω2.

We close this section with a number of examples. All of them are related to the
Maurer-Cartan form θ of a Lie group G. By Remark I/5.5.12/2, we have θa = a−1da,
a ∈G. Thus, θ is left invariant and right equivariant under the action of G by left and
right translations, respectively. Clearly, the right equivariance property reads
R∗
aθ = Ad(a−1) ◦θ.
12The ﬁrst summand takes values in the Lie algebra g1 of G1 and the second takes values in the Lie
algebra g2 of G2. The embedding mappings gi →g1 ⊕g2 are omitted.

Fibre Bundles and Connections
Example 1.3.18 (Canonical connection of the product bundle) Consider the product
bundle P = M × G, cf. Example 1.1.4/1. Take the connection Γ deﬁned by (1.3.8)
with χ being the identical mapping. The connection form corresponding to Γ is
given by
ω = pr∗
G θ,
where prG : M × G →G denotes the canonical projection. Details are left to the
reader (Exercise 1.3.7).
♦
Example 1.3.19 (Reductive homogeneous space) Let G be a Lie group and let H ⊂G
be a closed subgroup. Then, by Example 1.1.4/3, G carries the structure of a principal
H-bundle over the homogeneous space G/H. Assume, additionally, that G/H is
reductive, that is, the Lie algebra g of G admits a vector space decomposition
g = h ⊕m
such that Ad(H)m ⊂m. Here, h denotes the Lie algebra of H. If G is semisimple,
then m can be chosen to be the orthogonal complement to h in the sense of the Killing
form (Exercise 1.3.6).
Clearly, the vertical subspace at a ∈G is given by L′
a(h). Since for any a ∈G,
we have TaG = L′
a(h) ⊕L′
a(m), the left invariant distribution a →Γa := L′
a(m) on
G is complementary to the canonical vertical distribution. Using the reductivity, it is
easy to show that Γ is right H-equivariant. Thus, Γ deﬁnes a connection on G. The
corresponding connection form is given by
ω0 = prh ◦θ,
(1.3.17)
where prh is the canonical projection onto the ﬁrst summand of the above reductive
decomposition. Details are left to the reader (Exercise 1.3.7).
♦
Example 1.3.20 (Canonical connection on the Stiefel bundle) Recall the Stiefel bun-
dles
SK(k, n) ∼= UK(n)/UK(n −k) →GK(k, n) ∼= UK(n)/(UK(n −k) × UK(k))
discussed in Example 1.1.24. Denote the Lie algebra of the isometry group UK(i) by
uK(i), i = k, n −k, n. Since UK(n −k) and UK(k) act in complementary orthogonal
subspaces of Kn, the direct sum of their Lie algebras is a Lie subalgebra of uK(n)
and we have a direct sum decomposition
uK(n) = uK(k) ⊕m.
Here, m = uK(n −k) ⊕n and n is the orthogonal complement of
uK(k) ⊕uK(n −k) ⊂uK(n)

1.3 Connections

with respect to the Killing form. The restriction of the adjoint representation
Ad(UK(k)) acts on uK(n −k) trivially and leaves the subspace n invariant. Thus,
the above decomposition is reductive. As in Example 1.3.19, we put
ωc := pruK(k) ◦θ.
(1.3.18)
Clearly, ωc is a uK(k)-valued 1-form on UK(n). Since ωc is invariant under the
UK(n −k)-action on UK(n), it descends to a uK(k)-valued 1-form on SK(k, n) which
we denote by the same symbol. We claim that ωc is a connection form. To prove
this, we have to check the deﬁning conditions 2 and 3 of Proposition 1.3.5. To check
condition 2, note that the Killing vector ﬁeld of the right UK(k)-action on UK(n)
generated by A ∈uK(k) coincides with A viewed as a left invariant vector ﬁeld,
(A∗)a = d
dt ↾0
(a exp(tA)) = aA,
a ∈UK(n).
SincetherightactionsofUK(k)andUK(n −k)onUK(n)commute,theKillingvector
ﬁeld of the right UK(k)-action on SK(k, n) generated by A ∈uK(k) may be identiﬁed
with A∗. Now, condition 2 follows from the deﬁning equation of the Maurer-Cartan
form, θ(A) = A. Condition 3 follows immediately from the right UK(n)-equivariance
of θ. The connection deﬁned by ωc is called the canonical or universal13 connection
of the Stiefel bundle. By left invariance of the Maurer-Cartan form, the canonical
connection is invariant under left translations of UK(n).
We give an explicit description of ωc in terms of matrix-valued functions: let
{e1, . . . , en} be the standard basis in Kn. If we choose the k-frame u0 = (e1, . . . , ek),
then the subgroups UK(k) and UK(n −k) are given in block matrix form by an upper
diagonal (k × k)-block and by a lower diagonal ((n −k) × (n −k))-block in UK(n),
respectively. Let a ∈UK(n) and let aij be the corresponding (n × n)-matrix with
respect to the standard basis. Since a†a = 1, ωc is represented by a (k × k)-valued
1-form on SK(k, n),
(ωc)α
β = (a†)α
j daj
β,
where α, β = 1, . . . k and j = 1, . . . , n. Denoting by u the matrix-valued function
which assigns to the k-frame uα = ajαej the (n × k)-matrix ajα, we obtain
ωc = u†du.
(1.3.19)
Since a†a = 1, we have u†u = 1k.

For later purposes, let us consider the following special case.
Example 1.3.22 (Canonical connection on the Hopf bundle) As noted in Remark
1.1.25, the Hopf bundles of Examples 1.1.20 and 1.1.22 coincide with the Stiefel
bundles SK(1, 2) →GK(1, 2) with K = C and K = H, respectively. First, consider
the complex Hopf bundle. In the notation of the above example, we have
u =

∈C2,
|z1|2 + |z2|2 = 1,
and thus the canonical connection is given by
ωc = z1 dz1 + z2 dz2.

quaternionic Hopf bundle, we have

Covariant Exterior Derivative and Curvature
The following notion plays a basic role in the theory of connections.
Deﬁnition 1.4.1 (Covariant exterior derivative) Let P be a principal bundle and
let F be a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space. The covariant exterior derivative14 of an
F-valued differential k-form α on P with respect to a connection Γ is the differential
(k + 1)-form with values in F deﬁned by
Dωα(X0, . . . , Xk) := dα(hor X0, . . . , hor Xk),
X0, . . . , Xk ∈X(P).
By deﬁnition, Dω fulﬁls the same product rule as the ordinary exterior derivative and
Dωα is horizontal. Moreover, as will be shown, Dω preserves the symmetry type of
any horizontal form.
We wish to derive an explicit formula for the covariant exterior derivative. For
that purpose, we need the following.
Lemma 1.4.2 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle with a connection Γ , let A∗be a
Killing vector ﬁeld on P, let X ∈X(P) be horizontal and let Y ∈X(M). Then, [A∗, X]
is horizontal and [A∗, Y h] = 0.

= σa−1 ◦Dω ˜α (X0, . . . , Xk) .
This shows that Dω ˜α is of type σ.
2. Since each of the vectors X0, . . . , Xk ∈TpP may be decomposed into a vertical
and a horizontal part, it is enough to consider the following cases:
(a) Let all vectors Xi be horizontal. Then, ω(Xi) = 0 and formula (1.4.1) follows
from Deﬁnition 1.4.1.
(b) Let one of the vectors Xi, say X0, be vertical and let the remaining vectors be
horizontal. Then, there exists an element A ∈g such that X0 = Ψ ′
p(A) and a family of
vector ﬁelds Y1, . . . Yk ∈X(M) such that their horizontal lifts Y h
i at p coincide with
the vectors X1, . . . , Xk. Then,
Dω ˜α(X0, . . . , Xk) = 0,
(σ ′(ω) ∧˜α)(X0, . . . , Xk) = σ ′(A)(˜α(X1, . . . , Xk)).
Using Proposition I/4.1.6, Lemma 1.4.2, the horizontality of ˜α and the G-invariance
of the horizontal lifts Y h
i , we calculate

Thus, in this case, the right hand side of (1.4.1) also vanishes.
(c) Let at least two of the vectors Xi be vertical and let the remaining vectors be
horizontal. Then,
Dω ˜α(X0, . . . , Xk) = 0,
(σ ′(ω) ∧˜α)(X0, . . . , Xk) = 0,
and it remains to show that d ˜α(X0, . . . , Xk) = 0. Since the commutator of verti-
cal vector ﬁelds is vertical, the assertion follows from Proposition I/4.1.6 and the
horizontality of ˜α.

Remark 1.4.4 In particular, the covariant exterior derivative of an equivariant map-
ping ˜Φ ∈HomG(P, F) is given by
Dω ˜Φ = d ˜Φ + σ ′(ω) ◦˜Φ.

Clearly, this is an immediate consequence of formula (1.4.1). The following inde-
pendent proof gives some additional insight.

Deﬁnition 1.4.5 Let P be a principal G-bundle, let E = P ×G F be associated with
P and let ω be a connection on P. An element ˜α ∈Ωk
σ,hor(P, F) will be called parallel
with respect to ω if

Fibre Bundles and Connections
Dω ˜α = 0.
(1.4.3)
Next, recall that the ordinary exterior derivative d fulﬁls d ◦d = 0. In sharp contrast,
Dω ◦Dω does not vanish in general. This non-vanishing property is closely related
to the notion of curvature.
Deﬁnition 1.4.6 (Curvature form) Let P be a principal bundle and let ω be a con-
nection form on P. The curvature form of ω is deﬁned by
Ω := Dωω.
By deﬁnition, Ω is horizontal. Moreover, by point 3 of Proposition 1.3.5,
Ψ ∗
a Ω = Ad

a−1
◦Ω,
a ∈G.
(1.4.4)
Thus, the curvature form is a g-valued horizontal 2-form on P of type Ad.
Remark 1.4.7
1. By deﬁnition, we have Ω(X, Y) = dω(X, Y) for any pair of horizontal vector
ﬁelds X and Y. Using Proposition I/4.1.6 and the deﬁning equation (1.3.6), we
obtain
ver([X, Y])p = −Ψ ′
p(Ω(X, Y)).
(1.4.5)
By the Frobenius Theorem, we conclude that the horizontal distribution Γ deﬁn-
ing the connection form ω is integrable iff the curvature form Ω vanishes. A
connection with vanishing curvature is said to be ﬂat.
2. Since Ω is a horizontal 2-form of type Ad, by Proposition 1.2.12, it may be
viewed as a 2-form on M with values in the associated bundle
Ad(P) := P ×G g,
(1.4.6)
which will be referred to as the adjoint bundle of P.
♦
Remark 1.4.8
1. Below, we will often deal with the exterior product of Lie algebra-valued forms.
According to Remark I/4.1.10/2, the exterior product of a k-form α with an l-form
β on a manifold M, both with values in a Lie algebra g, is deﬁned as follows:
[α, β](X1, . . . , Xk+l)
=
1
k! l!

1.4 Covariant Exterior Derivative and Curvature
41
for X1, . . . , Xk+l ∈X(M). If the Lie algebra g is a subalgebra of the associative
algebra gl(n, K), then one can work with the associative wedge product α ∧β as
well. The latter is deﬁned by (1.4.7) with the Lie product on the right hand side
replaced by the associative product inherited from gl(n, K). Clearly, then [α, β]
may be expressed in terms of the associative wedge product (Exercise 1.4.1),
[α, β] = α ∧β + (−1)kl+1β ∧α.
(1.4.8)
2. Clearly, point 1 applies, in particular, to horizontal forms on a principal bundle
P(M, G) with values in g. On the other hand, note that the vector space isomor-
phisms (1.2.2) identifying g with the ﬁbres of the adjoint bundle Ad(P) transport
the Lie algebra structure from g to the ﬁbres of Ad(P). Thus, for elements of
Ωk(M, Ad(P)) we have a natural commutator denoted in the same way. This
remark applies, of course, to any vector bundle whose ﬁbres carry the structure
of a Lie algebra.
♦
Proposition 1.4.9 (Structure Equation) Let P be a principal bundle, let ω be a
connection form on P and let Ω be its curvature form. Then,
dω = −1
2[ω, ω] + Ω.
(1.4.9)
Proof We evaluate both sides of (1.4.9) on vector ﬁelds X, Y ∈X(P). By (1.4.7), we
have 1
2[ω, ω](X, Y) = [ω(X), ω(Y)]. Clearly, it is enough to consider the following
three cases:
1. X and Y are horizontal. Then, ω(X) = ω(Y) = 0 and
Ω(X, Y) = dω(hor X, hor Y) = dω(X, Y) .
2. X is vertical and Y is horizontal. Then, ω(Y) = 0 and Ω(X, ·) = 0. Thus, the
right hand side of (1.4.9) vanishes. To calculate the left hand side, without loss of
generality, we may assume X = A∗for some A ∈g. Then, ω(A∗) = A and we obtain
dω(A∗, Y) = Y(ω(A∗)) −A∗(ω(Y)) −ω([A∗, Y]) = −ω([A∗, Y]) = 0,
because, according to Lemma 1.4.2, [A∗, Y] is horizontal.
3. X and Y are vertical. Then, Ω(X, Y) = 0. Taking X = A∗and Y = B∗, for some
A, B ∈g, and using15 [A∗, B∗] = [A, B]∗, we calculate
dω(A∗, B∗) = −ω([A∗, B∗]) = −ω([A, B]∗) = −[A, B] = −[ω(A∗), ω(B∗)].

Remark 1.4.10
1. By (1.4.8), if g is a subalgebra of gl(n, K), then we can rewrite the Structure
Equation in terms of the associative wedge product,
dω = −ω ∧ω + Ω.
2. Recall thetransformationproperties ϑ∗ω2 = dλ ◦ω1 andϑ∗Ω2 = dλ ◦Ω1 under
some special principal bundle morphisms (ϑ, λ) as proved in Propositions
1.3.13/2 and 1.3.15/2. Note that, by the Structure Equation, the transformation
law for the curvature is an immediate consequence of the transformation law for
the connection.
♦
As an immediate consequence of the Structure Equation, we obtain the following.
Proposition 1.4.11 (Bianchi Identity) Let P be a principal bundle and let Ω be the
curvature form of a connection form ω on P. Then, Ω is parallel with respect to ω,
DωΩ = 0.
(1.4.10)
Proof Clearly, it is enough to show that dΩ(X, Y, Z) = 0 for arbitrary horizontal
vector ﬁelds X, Y and Z on P. Using the Structure Equation, we calculate
dΩ(X, Y, Z) = 1

−[ω([X, Y]), ω(Z)] + [ω([X, Z]), ω(Y)] −[ω([Y, Z]), ω(X)]
= 0,
because ω vanishes on horizontal vector ﬁelds.

Remark 1.4.12 Let ˜α ∈Ωk
Ad,hor(P, g). Since ad(ω) ∧˜α = [ω, ˜α], Proposition 1.4.3
implies
Dω ˜α = d ˜α + [ω, ˜α].
Thus, in particular, DωΩ = dΩ + [ω, Ω], and the Bianchi Identity (1.4.10) takes
the form
dΩ + [ω, Ω] = 0 .
(1.4.11)
♦
Applying Dω to equation (1.4.1), one ﬁnds the following (Exercise 1.4.3).
Proposition 1.4.13 Let ˜α ∈Ωk

Dω ◦Dω ˜α = σ ′(Ω) ∧˜α.

1.4 Covariant Exterior Derivative and Curvature
43
This yields another geometric interpretation of the curvature form Ω. It measures
to which extent Dω ◦Dω is non-vanishing when acting on a horizontal form. If the
connection is ﬂat, then Dω ◦Dω = 0.
Weclosethis sectionbygivingthelocal descriptionof theabovedeﬁnedgeometric
objects. First, let us ﬁnd the local representative of the covariant exterior derivative
of ˜α ∈Ωk
σ,hor(P, F). For simplicity, we will omit the index ω in the covariant exterior
derivative. By Proposition 1.4.3, D˜α is an element of Ωk+1
σ,hor(P, F). Thus, we read
off its local representative from (1.2.15):
(D˜α)χ = s∗D˜α.
(1.4.13)
Let us calculate the right hand side of (1.4.13) for a 0-form ˜Φ explicitly. Formula
(1.4.2) implies
s∗(D ˜Φ) = d(s∗˜Φ) + s∗(σ ′(ω) ◦˜Φ).
For the second term, we calculate

Dϕ = dϕ + σ ′(A )ϕ.
(1.4.14)
Here, σ ′(A ) is a 1-form on U with values in End(F). In the following remark, we
analyze formula (1.4.14) further.
Remark 1.4.14 If (U, κ) is a local chart, {ta} a basis in g and {eα} is a basis in F, we

Next, let us discuss the local description of the curvature form. If s: U →π−1(U),
with U ⊂M open, is a local section, then we deﬁne the local representative of Ω by
F := s∗Ω.
(1.4.16)
Let A be the local representative of ω with respect to the section s. Then, the Structure
Equation for ω implies
F = dA + 1
2[A , A ].

The Koszul Calculus
In this section, we show that the notion of covariant exterior derivative with respect to
a connection on a principal bundle implies a calculus for covariant derivatives acting
as differential operators in the space of sections of any associated vector bundle.16
This is often referred to as the Koszul calculus.17
As above, let P(M, G) be a principal bundle, let (F, G, σ) be a Lie group represen-
tation and let E = P ×G F be the associated vector bundle. Recall that, by Remark
1.3.3/3, a connection Γ on P induces a connection Γ E on E and the connection form
ω of Γ induces a connection mapping ωE : TE →E, given by (1.3.9). Using the
isomorphism between Ωk
σ,hor(P, F) and Ωk(M, E) provided by Proposition 1.2.12,
we can carry over the notion of covariant exterior derivative to Ωk(M, E).
Deﬁnition 1.5.1 Let α ∈Ωk(M, E). The covariant exterior derivative dωα is deﬁned
to be the image of Dω ˜α under the isomorphism Ωk+1
σ,hor(P, F) →Ωk+1(M, E), that
is,

dωα := Dω ˜α.
(1.5.1)
By deﬁnition, for p ∈π−1(m) and Xi ∈TmM, Yi ∈TpP fulﬁlling π′(Yi) = Xi, we
have
(dωα)m(X1, . . . , Xk+1) = ιp ◦(Dω ˜α)p(Y1, . . . , Yk+1).
(1.5.2)
Since Ω0(M, E) = Γ ∞(E) and Ω1(M, E) = Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E), dω restricted to 0-
forms yields a linear operator from Γ ∞(E) to Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E).
Deﬁnition 1.5.2 The linear operator
∇ω := (dω)↾Ω0(M,E) : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E)
is called the covariant derivative on E induced from ω.
By (1.5.2) and the deﬁnition of Dω, for any m ∈M and any Φ ∈Γ ∞(E), we have
(∇ωΦ)m(X) = ιp ◦(Dω ˜Φ)p(Y) = ιp ◦(Xh
p( ˜Φ)),
p ∈π−1(m),
(1.5.3)
16By Remark 1.2.9/2, in doing so we exhaust all ﬁnite-rank vector bundles.

where Y ∈TpP fulﬁlling π′(Y) = X and Xh is the horizontal lift of X to P.
In the sequel, we assume that a connection has been chosen and, for simplicity,
we write ∇instead of ∇ω.
Formula (1.5.3) implies a useful expression for the action of ∇on local frames
of E. To derive it, recall that a local trivialization of a principal G-bundle P over M
induces a local trivialization of any associated bundle E = P ×G F. Correspondingly,
for a chosen basis {eα} of the typical ﬁbre F, a local section s of P induces a local
frame {eα}, α = 1, . . . , p, of E via
eα(m) = ιs(m)(eα).
(1.5.4)
Let ˜eα : P →F be the equivariant mapping corresponding to eα. Then,
˜eα(s(m)) = eα.
(1.5.5)
Proposition 1.5.3 Let P be a principal G-bundle over M endowed with a connection
form ω, let E = P ×G F be an associated vector bundle and let ∇be the covariant
derivative induced from ω. Let s be a local section of P and let {eα} be a local frame
of E induced from s. Then,
∇eα = A β
α eβ,
(1.5.6)
where A = s∗ω is the local representative of ω and A βα denotes its matrix with
respect to the basis {eα} of F, cf. Remark 1.4.14.
Proof Consider (1.5.3) for a point m ∈M belonging to the domain of s. Since we
can take its right hand side at any point in the ﬁbre over m, we calculate it at s(m)
and for Y we take the vector s′(X) which is tangent to the section s at s(m). Using
(1.4.2), (1.5.4) and (1.5.5), for any X ∈TmM, we calculate

Equation (1.5.7) is called the Leibniz rule for ∇.
Remark 1.5.5
1. Combining Propositions 1.5.3 and 1.5.4 with Remark 1.4.14, for a local section
ϕ = ϕαeα of E, decomposed with respect to a local frame eα, we obtain
∇ϕ = dϕα ⊗eα + A β
αϕαeβ.
(1.5.8)
2. We have the following obvious generalization of Proposition 1.5.4 (Exercise
1.5.1). For α ∈Ωk(M, E) and β ∈Ωl(M),
dω(β ∧α) = dβ ∧α + (−1)lβ ∧dωα.
(1.5.9)
3. Let E be a K-vector bundle of rank k over M. By point 2 of Remark 1.2.9, E is
naturally associated with the bundle L(E) of linear frames, that is, there exists a
vector bundle isomorphism E ∼= L(E) ×GL(k,K) Kk. By deﬁnition, a connection
on E is a C-linear mapping ∇: Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E) fulﬁlling the Leibniz
rule (1.5.7). Then, by the above correspondence, connections on E are in one-
to-one correspondence with connections on L(E). Thereby, the connection ∇
corresponding to the connection form ω coincides with the covariant derivative
deﬁned by ω. Thus, the theory of connections on arbitrary vector bundles boils
down to the theory of covariant derivatives in associated vector bundles.
4. By point 3, Proposition 1.5.3 immediately extends to any vector bundle E
endowed with a connection. Then, P coincides with the L(E) and σ is the basic
representation of GL(n, K).
♦
The following proposition clariﬁes the relation of the covariant derivative with the
connection mapping, cf. Remark 1.3.9.
Proposition 1.5.6 For X ∈X(M),
∇Φ(X) = ωE(Φ′(X)).
Proof By the deﬁnition of ωE, we must decompose Φ′(X) into its vertical and hori-
zontal parts. For that purpose, let t →γ (t) be an integral curve of X through m ∈M.
Then,
Φ′Xm = d

Choose a point p ∈π−1(m) and take the integral curve t →γ h(t) through p of the

This is the vertical component of Φ′(X) at Φ(m). Thus, by (1.3.9) and (1.5.3),
ωE(Φ′(X)) = ιp ◦Xh( ˜Φ) = ∇Φ(X) .
■
Next, recall the notion of parallelity, cf. Deﬁnition 1.4.5. By (1.5.3), a section
Φ ∈Γ ∞(E) is parallel iff ∇XΦ = 0 for all X ∈X(M). Proposition 1.5.6 implies the
following.
Corollary 1.5.7 A section Φ ∈Γ ∞(E) is parallel with respect to a connection Γ
iff im(Φ′
m) ⊂Γ E
Φ(m) for all m ∈M.
■
In the sequel, it will be often useful to view the covariant derivative as a differential
operator acting on sections: for every X ∈X(M), the covariant derivative induces a
mapping
∇X : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(E),
∇XΦ := ∇Φ(X).
(1.5.10)
Proposition 1.5.8 For X, X1, X2 ∈X(M), Φ, Φ1, Φ2 ∈Γ ∞(E) and f ∈C∞(M),
1. ∇X1+X2Φ = ∇X1Φ + ∇X2Φ,
2. ∇X(Φ1 + Φ2) = ∇X(Φ1) + ∇X(Φ2),
3. ∇fXΦ = f ∇XΦ,
4. ∇X(f Φ) = f ∇XΦ + X(f ) Φ.

1.5 The Koszul Calculus

Proof Points 1 and 2 are immediate consequences of the deﬁnition of ∇X. Using
Remark 1.2.13, together with (fX)h = ˜f Xh, we get
(∇Φ)m(fX) = ιp ◦((fX)h( ˜Φ)) = ιp ◦(˜f Xh( ˜Φ)) = f (m)(∇Φ)m(X),
for any p ∈π−1(m). This proves point 3. Point 4 is an immediate consequence of
Proposition 1.5.4.
■
Remark 1.5.9
1. By the locality property 3 of Proposition 1.5.8, for any point m ∈M, the value of
(∇XΦ)(m) depends only on the value of X at m and on the values of the section
Φ : M →E along any smooth curve representing Xm. Thus, we obtain a mapping
∇: TM × Γ ∞(E) →E deﬁned by
∇YmΦ = (∇XΦ)(m),
where X is an arbitrary extension of the tangent vector Ym ∈TmM to a smooth
vector ﬁeld on M. Sometimes, it is useful to view a covariant derivative in this
way.
2. The covariant derivative on a vector bundle E over M naturally induces covariant
derivatives on all tensor bundles over E: for the dual bundle E∗we deﬁne
(∇E∗
X Φ∗)(Φ) := X(⟨Φ∗, Φ⟩) −⟨Φ∗, ∇E
X Φ⟩,
(1.5.11)
where X ∈X(M), Φ ∈Γ ∞(E) and Φ∗∈Γ ∞(E∗). Next, we extend ∇X to any
tensor product built from E and E∗by requiring that it be a derivation with respect
to the tensor product of sections.
3. Let E1 and E2 be vector bundles over M endowed with connections ∇1 and ∇2.
Then,
∇(s1 ⊗s2) := (∇1s1) ⊗s2 + s1 ⊗(∇2s2),
si ∈Γ ∞(Ei), i = 1, 2, (1.5.12)
deﬁnes a connection on E1 ⊗E2 called the tensor product connection.
In particular, let E1 and E2 be associated with the principal bundles P1(M, G1)
and P2(M, G2). Then, by Example 1.2.4/3, E1 ⊗E2 is naturally associated with
the ﬁbre product P1 ×M P2, cf. Remark 1.1.9/2. If ω1 and ω2 are connection forms
on P1 and P2, respectively, then the latter is endowed with the natural connection
form ϑ∗ω given by (1.3.16). If ∇1 and ∇2 are the covariant derivatives in E1 and
E2 induced from ω1 and ω2, respectively, then the covariant derivative induced
from ϑ∗ω coincides with the tensor product connection ∇1 ⊗∇2 (Exercise 1.5.2).
♦
Next, recall that, as a consequence of Proposition 1.4.13, the square of the covari-
ant exterior derivative in general does not vanish and that this non-vanishing is
measured by the curvature of the connection under consideration. Let us ﬁnd the

counterpart of this fact within the Koszul calculus. For that purpose, recall that Ω is
a horizontal 2-form on P with values in g. Since σ ′ is a homomorphism from g to
End(F), σ ′(Ω) is a horizontal 2-form on P with values in End(F). Thus, by Proposi-
tion 1.2.12, to Ω there corresponds a 2-form on M with values in the endomorphism
bundle End(E):
R∇
m(X, Y) := ιp ◦σ ′(Ωp(Xh, Y h)) ◦ι−1
p ,
(1.5.13)
where m ∈M, p ∈π−1(m), X, Y ∈TmM and Xh and Y h are the horizontal lifts of X
and Y to p, respectively.
Deﬁnition 1.5.10 The 2-form R∇is called the curvature endomorphism form asso-
ciated with Ω.
Proposition 1.5.11 For any pair of vector ﬁelds X, Y ∈X(M),
R∇(X, Y) = ∇X∇Y −∇Y∇X −∇[X,Y].
(1.5.14)
Proof Let X, Y ∈X(M) and let Xh, Y h be their horizontal lifts to P. Let p ∈P. Using
(1.4.5), (1.5.3) and hor([Xh, Y h]) = [X, Y]h, we calculate
Ψ ′
p(Ω(Xh, Y h)) ˜Φ(p) = −ver([Xh, Y h])p( ˜Φ)
= −[Xh, Y h]p( ˜Φ) + hor([Xh, Y h])p( ˜Φ)
= −[Xh, Y h]p( ˜Φ) + [X, Y]h
p( ˜Φ)
= −Xh
p(Y h( ˜Φ)) + Y h

(m).
Now, the assertion follows from Ψ ′
p(A)( ˜Φ) = −σ ′(A) ˜Φ(p) for all A ∈g.
■
Remark 1.5.12
1. Viewing the covariant derivative as a linear mapping
∇: X(M) →End(Γ ∞(E)),
X →∇X,
we conclude that this mapping is a Lie algebra homomorphism iff the curvature
endomorphism form vanishes.
2. Formula (1.5.14) extends to sections in arbitrary tensor bundles Tk
l (E) over E,
where R∇(X, Y) acts on Tk
l (E) in the representation induced by σ ′ (Exercise
1.5.5).
♦
In Sect.1.3, we have discussed in detail the transport of connections on prin-
cipal bundles under morphisms fulﬁlling some additional conditions, cf. Proposi-
tions1.3.13 and 1.3.15 and the associated corollaries. Clearly, the transported con-
nections induce covariant derivatives in the corresponding associated bundles. For

1.5 The Koszul Calculus
51
later purposes, the pullback connection will be especially important. Thus, we discuss
it in some detail.
Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle, let N be a manifold, let ϕ : N →M be a smooth
mapping and let ϕ∗P be the pullback bundle induced by ϕ. Let (F, G, σ) be a Lie
group representation and let E = P ×G F be the corresponding bundle associated
with P. By Example 1.2.4/2, the pullback bundle ϕ∗E is naturally associated with
ϕ∗P via the vector bundle isomorphism
ϕ∗E →ϕ∗P ×G F,
(y, [(p, f )]) →[((y, p), f )],
cf. (1.2.6). By point 2 of Corollary 1.3.16, every connection ω on P induces a con-
nection ϑ∗ω on the pullback bundle ϕ∗P. Here, ϑ : ϕ∗P →P is the induced bundle
morphism. If Γ E denotes the connection on E induced from ω, then the connection
Γ ϕ∗E on ϕ∗E induced from the pullback connection ϑ∗ω is given by
Γ ϕ∗E = (π′
2)−1(Γ E).
Using the obvious identiﬁcation
T(y,e)ϕ∗E ∼= π′
1(T(y,e)ϕ∗E) ⊕π′
2(T(y,e)ϕ∗E),
we obtain
T(y,e)ϕ∗E =

(Y, Z) ∈TyN ⊕TeE : ϕ′
y(Y) = (πF)′
e(Z)

.
Thus, the decomposition of (Y, Z) ∈T(y,e)ϕ∗E with respect to Γ ϕ∗E is given by
(Y, Z) = (0, Zv) + (Y, Zh),
(1.5.15)
with Z = Zv + Zh being the decomposition with respect to Γ E.
Let us analyze the induced covariant derivative ∇ϑ∗ω. For that purpose, it is con-
venient to view the space of sections of ϕ∗E as follows.
Deﬁnition 1.5.13 In the above notation, a section of E along ϕ is a mapping φ :
N →E fulﬁlling
πF ◦φ = ϕ.
The vector space of sections of E along ϕ is denoted by Γ ∞
ϕ (E).
Clearly, φ is a section of E along ϕ iff y →(y, φ(y)) is a section of ϕ∗E, that is,
Γ ∞(ϕ∗E) is canonically isomorphic to Γ ∞
ϕ (E).
Now, let Φ ∈Γ ∞(ϕ∗E) and let Y ∈X(N). Representing Φ by a section φ ∈
Γ ∞
ϕ (E) and using Proposition 1.5.6, together with (1.2.6), (1.5.15) and (1.3.9), we
calculate

Bundle Reduction
Recall from Sect.1.1 that a morphism (ϑ, λ) of principal bundles Q(M, H) and
P(M, G) is called a λ-reduction or, simply, a reduction of P to H if Q is a subbundle
of P fulﬁlling ˜ϑ = idM. In that case, P is called λ-reducible to H and Q is called a
λ-reduction of P.
We start with giving two criteria for the reducibility of principal bundles. For the
following, recall the description of principal bundles in terms of transition mappings.

1.6 Bundle Reduction
53
Proposition 1.6.1 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle and let λ: H →G be an
injective Lie group homomorphism. Then, P is λ-reducible iff there exists a covering
{Ui} of M and an associated 1-cocyle {ρij} of P with values in im(λ).
Proof Let Q(M, H) be a λ-reduction of P and let (ϑ, λ) be the corresponding mor-
phism. Let {(Ui, χQ
i )} be a bundle atlas of Q and let {τij} be the corresponding 1-
coycle. Since every local section s in Q deﬁnes a local section in P by ϑ ◦s, each χQ
i
deﬁnes a local trivialization χP
i of P over Ui. Let κQ
i and κP
i be the equivariant map-
pings corresponding to χQ
i and χP
i , respectively. One can check that λ ◦κQ
i = κP
i ◦ϑ.
Hence, the transition mappings of the family {χP
i } are given by
ρij(m) = κP
i (ϑ(q))κP

−1 = λ(κQ
i (q))λ

κQ
j (q)
−1 = λ

κQ
i (q)κQ
j (q)−1
and, thus,
ρij = λ ◦τij
for all i, j.
(1.6.1)
Conversely, let {ρij} be the 1-cocyle associated with a bundle atlas {(Ui, χP
i )}.
Assume that it takes values in im(λ). Since λ is injective, the ρij deﬁne mappings
τij : Ui ∩Uj →H via (1.6.1). Since injective Lie group homomorphisms are immer-
sions, cf. Corollary I/5.3.7, (H, λ) is a Lie subgroup. Since Lie subgroups are initial
submanifolds, cf. Proposition I/5.6.4, the τij are smooth. Moreover, the cocycle prop-
erty of {ρij} implies that of {τij}. According to Proposition 1.1.10, the 1-cocycle {τij}
deﬁnes a principal H-bundle Q over M. Let πQ : Q →M be the canonical projection
and let {(Ui, χQ
i )} be the bundle atlas of Q constructed in the proof of this proposition.
For every i, we deﬁne a mapping
ϑi : π−1
Q (Ui) →π−1
P (Ui),
ϑi :=

χP
i
−1 ◦(idUi ×λ) ◦χQ
i ,
where πP : P →M is the canonical projection of P. By (1.6.1), we have ϑi = ϑj for
any pair (i, j) such that Ui ∩Uj ̸= ∅. Thus, the family of mappings {ϑi} deﬁnes an
equivariant mapping ϑ : Q →P. By construction, (ϑ, λ) is a λ-reduction.
■
The next proposition provides a criterion for reducibility in terms of equivariant
mappings.
Proposition 1.6.2 Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle and let (F, G, σ) be a
transitive Lie group action. Let f ∈F and let Gf ⊂G be the stabilizer of f under the
action σ. Then, every equivariant mapping ϕ ∈HomG(P, F) deﬁnes a reduction of
P to an embedded principal Gf -subbundle
Qf = {p ∈P : ϕ(p) = f }.
(1.6.2)
Conversely, every such reduction deﬁnes an element ϕ ∈HomG(P, F).
Proof Let ϕ ∈HomG(P, F) and let Qf be given by (1.6.2). Since σ is transitive and
ϕ is equivariant, ϕ is a submersion. Hence, by the Level Set Theorem, Qf = ϕ−1(f )

54

Fibre Bundles and Connections
is an embedded submanifold of P for all f ∈F. Since for every q ∈Qf and every
a ∈Gf ,
ϕ(Ψa(q)) = σa−1(ϕ(q)) = σa−1f = f ,
Qf is Gf -invariant. Thus, Ψ induces a free right action of Gf on Qf , denoted by
the same symbol. Since Gf is closed, cf. Proposition I/6.1.5, the induced action is
proper, cf. Proposition I/6.3.4. Hence, Qf is a principal Gf -bundle over the manifold
Qf /Gf . The natural inclusion mappings Qf →P and Gf →G deﬁne a principal
bundle morphism. Let ˜ϑ : Qf /Gf →M be the corresponding projection. It remains
to show that ˜ϑ is a diffeomorphism. By local triviality, it sufﬁces to show that ˜ϑ
is bijective. For that purpose, we show that Qf intersects every ﬁbre of P and that
the intersections coincide with the Gf -orbits. For the ﬁrst statement, let m ∈M and
let p ∈π−1(m). Since σ acts transitively, there exists an a ∈G such that ϕ(p) =
σa(f ). Then, ϕ(Ψa(p)) = σa−1(ϕ(p)) = f , that is, Ψa(p) ∈Qf . To prove the second
statement, let q1, q2 ∈Qf and a ∈G such that q2 = Ψa(q1). Then,
f = ϕ(q2) = ϕ(Ψa(q1)) = σa−1(ϕ(q1)) = σa−1(f ),
that is, a ∈Gf . Thus, Qf is a reduction of P to the subgroup Gf .
Conversely, let there be given a reduction of P to Q ⊂P with structure group
Gf ⊂Gandwiththemorphismgivenbythenaturalinclusionmapping.Then,wetake
the constant mapping ϕ : Q →F, ϕ(q) := f , and extend it to a mapping ϕ : P →F
by
ϕ(Ψa(q)) := σa−1(f ),
a ∈G, q ∈Q .
This mapping is well deﬁned: if Ψa1(q1) = Ψa2(q2) for q1, q2 ∈Q, then a1a−1
2
∈Gf
and thus
σa−1
2 (f ) = σa−1
1 ◦σa1a−1
2 (f ) = σa−1
1 (f ).
By construction, ϕ is smooth and equivariant.
■
Remark 1.6.3 The bundle reduction Qf depends on the choice of f ∈F as follows:
for every f ′ ∈F, there exists an a ∈G such that f ′ = σa(f ). Then, for every q ∈Qf ,
we have
ϕ(Ψa−1(q)) = σa(ϕ(q)) = σa(f ) = f ′.
Thus, Qf ′ = Ψa−1(Q). Moreover, the corresponding structure group is
Gf ′ = Gσa(f ) = aGf a−1.
♦
The following proposition characterizes the isomorphism classes of bundle reduc-
tions to a given structure group Gf .

1.6 Bundle Reduction
55
Proposition 1.6.4 Let ϕ ∈HomG(P, F) and let ϑ be a vertical automorphism of
P. If ϕ deﬁnes the bundle reduction Qf , then ϕ ◦ϑ deﬁnes the bundle reduction
ϑ−1(Qf ). In particular, two reductions to the structure group Gf are equivalent iff
the deﬁning equivariant mappings are related by a vertical automorphism.
Proof The reduced bundle deﬁned by ϕ ◦ϑ is
{p ∈P : ϕ ◦ϑ(p) = f } = ϑ−1 ({p ∈P : ϕ(p) = f }) = ϑ−1(Qf ).
■
Proposition 1.6.2 implies a useful characterization of reductions of a principal bun-
dle P(M, G) to a given closed subgroup H of G. To formulate it, we consider the
natural action of G on the homogeneous space G/H by left translation and build the
associated bundle P ×G G/H, cf. Example 1.2.4.
Corollary 1.6.5 The reductions of a principal G-bundle P to a closed subgroup H
of G are in one-to-one correspondence with the smooth sections of the associated
bundle P ×G G/H.
Proof By Proposition 1.2.6, the sections of P ×G G/H are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the elements of HomG(P, F). Since G/H is a transitive G-manifold, we
can apply Proposition 1.6.2 with f = [1].
■
The proofs of the following example are left to the reader (Exercise 1.6.1).
Example 1.6.6
1. Let E be a K-vector bundle of rank k, where K = R, C, and let L(E) be its
frame bundle. Recall from Remark I/2.2.2/3 that E is called orientable iff it
admits a family of local trivializations whose transition mappings have positive
determinant.Equivalently,E isorientableiffitadmitsanowherevanishingsection
of kE∗(the determinant line bundle of E). Thus, an orientation of E may be
viewed as a section of the associated bundle
L(E) ×GL(k,K) GL(k, K)/GL+(k, K),
where GL+(k, K) ⊂GL(k, K) is the subgroup of elements with positive deter-
minant. Now, Corollary 1.6.5 implies that E is orientable iff L(E) is reducible to
GL+(k, K).
2. We take up Examples 1.1.15 and 1.1.18. Let E be a K-vector bundle of rank n,
where K = R, C, endowed with a ﬁbre metric.
(a) Let K = R. A ﬁbre metric may be viewed as a section of the associated bundle
L(E) ×GL(n,R) (Rn)∗s⊗(Rn)∗,

56
1
Fibre Bundles and Connections
where
s⊗denotes the symmetric tensor product. By the Sylvester Theorem,
GL(n, R) acts transitively on the subspace S2
(k,l)Rn ⊂(Rn)∗s⊗(Rn)∗consisting
of elements of rank n = k + l and signature (k, l) and the stabilizer of the element
η = 1k ⊕(−1l) is O(k, l). Thus,
GL(n, R)/O(k, l) ∼= S2
(k,l)Rn,
and E admits a ﬁbre metric with signature (k, l) iff L(E) is reducible to a principal
O(k, l)-bundle. Clearly, the latter is the bundle of orthonormal frames O(E).
(b) Let K = C. A ﬁbre metric may be viewed as a section of the associated bundle
L(E) ×GL(n,C) (Cn)∗s⊗(Cn)∗.
By the Sylvester Theorem, GL(n, C) acts transitively on the subset of non-
degenerate elements in (Cn)∗s⊗(Cn)∗with stabilizer U(n). Thus, E admits a
Hermitean ﬁbre metric iff L(E) is reducible to a principal U(n)-bundle, which
then coincides with the bundle of unitary frames U(E).
♦
The following proposition shows that principal bundle reductions do not change the
isomorphism class of associated vector bundles.
Proposition 1.6.7 Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle and let (F, G, σ) be a
Lie group representation. Let Q be a reduction of P to the structure group H deﬁned
by the morphism (ϑ, λ). Let (F, H, σ ◦λ) be the associated Lie group representation
of H. Then, the associated vector bundles P ×G F and Q ×H F are isomorphic.
Proof Denote the H-action on Q by Ψ Q. The canonical projection of Q is given by
πQ = π ◦ϑ. Consider the mapping
ψ : Q ×H F →P ×G F,
ψ([(q, f )]) := [(ϑ(q), f )].
Since, for every h ∈H,
ψ

[(Ψ Q
h (q), σλ(h−1)f )]

= [(Ψλ(h)(ϑ(q)), σλ(h)−1f )] = [(ϑ(q), f )],
the mapping ψ is well deﬁned. By construction, ψ is ﬁbre-preserving and the induced
mappings ψq of the ﬁbres are linear. Finally, since ψ projects to the identical mapping
of M and since ψq ◦ιQ
q = ιP
ϑ(q), the mapping ψ is bijective. As a consequence of the
Inverse Mapping Theorem, the inverse mapping ψ−1 is smooth.
■
Given an injective Lie group homomorphism λ : H →G and a principal H-bundle Q,
we can form the associated principal G-bundle P = Q[λ]. Then, Q is a λ-reduction
of P and P is called a λ-extension of Q. By Corollary 1.3.14, the λ-extension of
a connection always exists. The case of a λ-reduction is slightly more involved.
Let us assume that G/H is a reductive homogeneous space. Then, in general, a

1.6 Bundle Reduction
57
principal bundle reduction induces a decomposition of a connection form into a pair
of geometrical objects.
Proposition 1.6.8 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle, let H ⊂G be a closed sub-
group and let Q(M, H) be a reduction of P given by the morphism (ϑ, iH) with
iH : H →G being the natural inclusion mapping. Assume that the Lie algebra g of
G admits a reductive decomposition
g = h ⊕m,
with h denoting the Lie algebra of H. Let ω be a connection form on P and let ωh
and ωm be its h- and m-components, respectively. Then,
1. ϑ∗ωh is a connection form on Q,
2. ϑ∗ωm is an m-valued horizontal 1-form on Q of type Ad(H)m.
Proof Let Ψ and ˜Ψ be the G- and the H-actions on P and Q, respectively. Then,
ϑ ◦˜Ψa(q) = Ψa ◦ϑ(q)
(1.6.3)
for any q ∈Q and a ∈H.
1. We must check that ϑ∗ωh has the properties of a connection form. Decomposing
ω = ωh + ωm on P and using that ω is a connection form, for any A ∈h, we have
A = ω(A∗) = ωh(A∗) + ωm(A∗),
where A∗denotes the Killing vector ﬁeld on P generated by A. Thus, ωm(A∗) = 0,
that is, ωh(A∗) = A. Let ˜A∗denote the Killing vector ﬁeld on Q generated by A.
Then, by (1.6.3), ϑ′ ◦˜A∗= A∗◦ϑ and thus ϑ∗ωh(˜A∗) = A. It remains to show H-
equivariance. For a ∈H, we have
Ψ ∗
a ω = Ad(a−1) ◦ω = Ad(a−1) ◦ωh + Ad(a−1) ◦ωm
and, on the other hand,
Ψ ∗
a ω = Ψ ∗
a ωh + Ψ ∗
a ωm.
By reductivity, Ad(a−1) ◦ωm takes values in m. Hence, Ψ ∗
a ωh = Ad(a−1) ◦ωh.
Then, taking the pullback of this equation under ϑ and using (1.6.3), we obtain the
assertion. Moreover, for later use, we note
Ψ ∗
a ωm = Ad(a−1) ◦ωm.
(1.6.4)
2. By (1.6.4), ϑ∗ωm is an m-valued 1-form of type Ad(H)m. It remains to show
that it is horizontal: for any A ∈h, using (1.6.3), we calculate
(ϑ∗ωm)q(˜A∗) = (ϑ∗ω)q(˜A∗) −(ϑ∗ωh)q(˜A∗).

Fibre Bundles and Connections
The second term yields −A. For the ﬁrst term, we compute
(ϑ∗ω)q(˜A∗) = ωϑ(q)(ϑ′ ◦˜A∗(q)) = ωϑ(q)(A∗◦ϑ(q)) = A .
■
We conclude that only in the case when ϑ∗ω takes values in h, its restriction to Q is
a connection form on Q. This result suggests the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.6.9 (Reducible connection) Let P be a principal G-bundle over a con-
nected manifold M. Let Γ be a connection on P and let ω be its connection form.
Let Q(M, H) be a reduction of P given by the morphism (ϑ, iH). Then, Γ is called
reducible to H if ϑ∗ω takes values in h. Γ is called irreducible if P is not reducible
to any genuine Lie subgroup of G.
Recall that reductions of a principal G-bundle P to a closed subgroup H of G are in
bijective correspondence with smooth sections of the associated bundle P ×G G/H,
cf. Corollary 1.6.5. Since orbits of Lie group actions are initial submanifolds, we can
carry over Proposition 1.6.2 to the case of a general Lie group action (F, G, σ) by
applying it to elements of HomG(P, F) with values in a single orbit of σ.
Proposition 1.6.10 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle and let (F, G, σ) be a rep-
resentation. Let ˜Φ ∈HomG(P, F) and assume that it takes values in a single orbit
O of σ. Let Q(M, H) be the reduction of P deﬁned by ˜Φ and some element f ∈O.
Then, a connection Γ on P is reducible to a connection Γ ′ on Q iff ˜Φ is parallel
with respect to Γ .
Proof Let ω be the connection form of Γ and let (ϑ, iH) be the morphism corre-
sponding to the reduction Q. Since Q =

p ∈P : ˜Φ(p) = f
 
, we have ϑ∗˜Φ = f on
Q. Thus,
ϑ∗
Dω ˜Φ

= d(ϑ∗˜Φ) + σ ′(ϑ∗ω)(ϑ∗˜Φ) = σ ′(ϑ∗ω)(ϑ∗˜Φ).
Now, Γ is reducible iff ϑ∗ω takes values in the Lie algebra h of H, that is, iff
σ ′(ϑ∗ω)(ϑ∗˜Φ) = 0, that is, iff ϑ∗
Dω ˜Φ

= 0. By the G-equivariance of Γ the
latter is equivalent to Dω ˜Φ = 0 on the whole of P.
■
Deﬁnition 1.6.11 (Compatible connection) Let Q(M, H) ⊂P(M, G) be a principal
bundle reduction deﬁned by an element ˜Φ ∈HomG(P, F) taking values in a single
orbit O and by a point f ∈O. A connection Γ on P will be referred to as compatible
with ˜Φ if it is reducible to Q.
By Proposition 1.6.10, a connection Γ is compatible with ˜Φ iff
Dω ˜Φ = 0.
(1.6.5)

1.6 Bundle Reduction
59
Here, ω is the connection form of Γ . Note that ˜Φ takes values in a single orbit O
iff the corresponding section Φ of P ×G F takes values in P ×G O. In terms of Φ,
(1.6.5) takes the form
∇ωΦ = 0.
(1.6.6)
In the sequel, we will frequently meet compatible connections, in particular in the
context of H-structures to be discussed in Chap.2. Here, we discuss one important
class of examples.
Example 1.6.12 (Connection compatible with a ﬁbre metric) We take up point 2
of Example 1.6.6. For K = R or C, let E be a K-vector bundle of rank n over M
endowed with a ﬁbre metric h. Recall that h may be viewed as a section of the
associated bundle L(E) ×GL(n,K) F, where F denotes the space of inner products
in Rn and Cn, respectively. In the case K = C, GL(n, C) acts transitively on F,
whereas in the case K = R it does not. If, in the latter case, we assume that M is
connected, then h takes values in a single GL(n, R)-orbit on F. Now, by (1.6.6), a
connection form ω on L(E) is compatible with h iff
∇ωh = 0.
Since ∇X is a derivation of the tensor algebra, this condition takes the following form:
X(h(Φ1, Φ2)) = h(∇XΦ1, Φ2) + h(Φ1, ∇XΦ2),
(1.6.7)
for any Φ1, Φ2 ∈Γ ∞(E) and X ∈X(M). If ω is compatible, then it is reducible to
the bundle of h-orthonormal or h-unitary frames of E, respectively.

In the next section, we will show that there exists a smallest reduction of a principal
G-bundle P with connection Γ , namely the reduction to the holonomy bundle. We
will see that a connection is irreducible iff P coincides with its holonomy bundle.

Deﬁnition 1.7.1 Let P be a principal G-bundle over M with canonical projection π,
let Γ be a connection on P and let γ and ˜γ be smooth curves in M and P, respectively.
The curve ˜γ is called
1. a lift of γ if π ◦˜γ = γ ,
2. horizontal relative to Γ , if all tangent vectors ˙˜γ are horizontal relative to Γ .
Proposition 1.7.2 Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle and let Γ be a con-
nection on P. Let I be an open interval containing 0 and let γ : I →M be a smooth
curve. Then, for every point p0 ∈π−1(γ (0)), there exists a unique horizontal lift γ h
of γ fulﬁlling p0 = γ h(0).
The proposition generalizes to piecewise smooth curves.
Proof We choose an arbitrary lift ˜γ of γ starting at p0 and seek the horizontal lift of
γ in the following form:
t →γ h(t) = Ψg(t) ˜γ (t),
see Fig.1.1. We will prove that there exists a unique curve t →g(t) in G such that
γ h is horizontal. Since Ψγ h(t) = Ψ ˜γ (t) ◦Lg(t), we have

Now, let I = [0, 1]. Recall that the concatenation of curves γ, τ : I →M satisfy-
ing γ (1) = τ(0) is deﬁned by
τ · γ (t) :=

(1.7.1)
and that the inverse curve is deﬁned by γ −1(t) = γ (1 −t). The proof of the following
lemma is left to the reader (Exercise 1.7.2).
Lemma 1.7.3 Let γ : I →M be a piecewise smooth curve, let p ∈π−1(γ (0)) and
let γ h be the horizontal lift of γ through p.
1. The horizontal lift of γ through Ψa(p) is given by Ψa ◦γ h.
2. If τ : I →M is another piecewise smooth curve fulﬁlling τ(0) = γ (1), then the
horizontal lift of τ · γ through p is given by τ h · γ h, where τ h is the horizontal
lift of τ through the point γ h(1).
3. The horizontal lift of γ −1 to the point γ h(1) is given by (γ h)−1.
Via the horizontal lift, every piecewise smooth curve γ : I →M deﬁnes a mapping
ˆγΓ : π−1(γ (0)) →π−1(γ (1)),
which assigns to p ∈π−1(γ (0)) the point γ h(1), where γ h is the horizontal lift of γ
through p.
Deﬁnition 1.7.4 The mapping ˆγΓ is called the operator of parallel transport along
γ with respect to the connection Γ .
By point 1 of Lemma 1.7.3, ˆγΓ is equivariant and, thus, an isomorphism of G-
manifolds. By point 3, we have

with ˆτγ and we have

Now, let us consider the important special case of parallel transport along closed
curves in M. Let C(m) be the set of piecewise smooth closed curves starting and
ending at m ∈M. The parallel transport along γ ∈C(m) yields an automorphism
of the ﬁbre π−1(m). For the trivial curve it coincides with the identity. Thus, the
set of parallel transports along elements of C(m) form a subgroup of the group of
automorphisms of the ﬁbre π−1(m).
Deﬁnition 1.7.6 The group of parallel transports along elements of C(m) is called
the holonomy group of Γ with base point m. It will be denoted by Hm(Γ ).
Let us denote by C0(m) ⊂C(m) the subset of closed curves which are homotopic
to the trivial curve. The corresponding subgroup H 0
m (Γ ) ⊂Hm(Γ ) is called the
restricted holonomy group of Γ with base point m.
We note that the holonomy groups can be naturally viewed as subgroups of the
structure group G: for every p ∈π−1(m) and γ ∈C(m), there exists a unique a ∈G
such that
ˆγΓ (p) = Ψa(p).
(1.7.5)
For another closed curve τ ∈C(m), let b ∈G be the corresponding group element.
Then,
ˆτΓ ◦ˆγΓ (p) = ˆτΓ (Ψa(p)) = Ψa ◦ˆτΓ (p) = Ψa ◦Ψb(p) = Ψba(p),
that is, to ˆτΓ ◦ˆγΓ there corresponds the product ba of elements of G. The subgroup
of G deﬁned in this way is called the holonomy group of Γ with base point p. It is
denoted by Hp(Γ ). Correspondingly, the restricted holonomy group with base point
p is denoted by H 0
p (Γ ). Obviously, Hp(Γ ) and Hm(Γ ) are isomorphic as abstract
groups.
Remark 1.7.7 Let us deﬁne the following equivalence relation on P: two points p1
and p2 of P are equivalent iff they can be joined by a horizontal curve of Γ . Then,

1.7 Parallel Transport and Holonomy
63
Hp(Γ ) coincides with the subset of elements a ∈G such that p ∈P is equivalent to
Ψa(p).
♦
The following proposition is a simple exercise which we leave to the reader (Exercise
1.7.1).
Proposition 1.7.8 Let P be a principal G-bundle over M and let Γ be a connection
on P.
1. The holonomy groups of Γ with base points p and Ψa(p), a ∈G, are conjugate
in G,
HΨa(p)(Γ ) = a−1Hp(Γ )a.
The same is true for the restricted holonomy groups.
2. If two points in P can be joined by a horizontal curve, then their holonomy groups
coincide.
■
Clearly, if M is connected, then for each pair p1 and p2 of points in P, there exists a
group element a ∈G, such that p1 and Ψa(p2) can be joined by a horizontal curve.
In this case, Proposition 1.7.8 implies that all holonomy groups Hp(Γ ), p ∈P, are
conjugate in G. Consequently, they are all isomorphic to each other.
Theorem 1.7.9 Let P be a principal G-bundle over M, let M be connected and let
Γ be a connection on P. Then, for every p ∈P,
1. H 0
p (Γ ) is a connected Lie subgroup of G,
2. H 0
p (Γ ) is a normal subgroup of Hp(Γ ) and Hp(Γ )/H 0
p (Γ ) is countable.
Our proof is along the lines of Sect.19.7 of [447]. First, we need the following lemma.
Recall that a manifold is said to be C∞-pathwise connected if any two of its points
can be joined by a smooth curve.
Lemma 1.7.10 Let H be a C∞-pathwise connected subgroup of a Lie group G.
Then, H is a connected Lie group and a Lie subgroup of G.
Proof Consider the following subset of the Lie algebra of G:
h :=

h′(0) ∈T1G : h ∈C∞(R, G), h(R) ⊂H, h(0) = 1

.
(1.7.6)
One can check that h is a Lie subalgebra of g (Exercise 1.7.3). Let ˜H be the corre-
sponding connected Lie subgroup of G provided by Proposition I/5.6.5. As shown
in the proof of this proposition, ˜H is the maximal integral submanifold through 1 of
the distribution Dh generated by h. Now, let t →h(t) be a smooth curve in G such
that h(R) ⊂H and h(0) = 1. Clearly,
L′
h(t)−1h′(t) = d
ds ↾s=0h(t)−1h(t + s) ∈h.

64

Fibre Bundles and Connections
Thus, by left invariance of Dh, t →h(t) lies in ˜H. Since, by assumption, every point
in H is connected with 1 via such a curve, we conclude H ⊂˜H.
To prove ˜H ⊂H, choose a basis (e1, . . . , en) in h and a family of smooth curves
t →hi(t) in G such that hi(R) ⊂H, hi(0) = 1 and h′
i(0) = ei. Consider the mapping
F : Rn →˜H,
F(t) := h1(t1) . . . hn(tn).
Clearly, F′(0) maps Rn bijectively onto h. Thus, by the Inverse Mapping Theorem, F
is a local diffeomorphism mapping an open neighbourhood of the origin in Rn onto an
open neighbourhood of 1 in ˜H. We conclude that H contains an open neighbourhood
of 1 in ˜H and, thus, ˜H ⊂H.
■
Proof of the theorem. We prove that the restricted holonomy group is C∞-pathwise
connected and apply the lemma.
Let m = π(p), let [0, 1] ∋s →γ (s) ∈M be an element of C0(m) and let γ h be
its horizontal lift starting at p. Choose a smooth homotopy ϕ : R2 →M such that
ϕ(1, s) = γ (s),
ϕ(0, s) = ϕ(t, 0) = ϕ(t, 1) = m,
for all (t, s) ∈[0, 1] × [0, 1]. By Corollary 1.3.16, the connection Γ induces a con-
nection Γ ϕ on the pullback principal bundle ϕ∗P. Let ϑ : ϕ∗P →P be the induced
morphism projecting to ϕ. Clearly, for every t ∈[0, 1], the preimage under ϕ of the
closed curve s →ϕ(t, s) is the line segment s →(t, s) in R2. Let Φ be the ﬂow of
the Γ ϕ-horizontal lift of ∂s. Then,
t →ϑ ◦Φ(t, 1)
is a smooth curve in P starting at p0 and ending at γ h(1). Via (1.7.5), it deﬁnes
a smooth curve in G starting at the unit element 1 and ending at the element of
H 0
p0(Γ ) deﬁned by γ , that is, H 0
p0(Γ ) is a C∞-pathwise connected subgroup of G.
Now, Lemma 1.7.10 implies the ﬁrst assertion.
Let us prove the second assertion. Clearly, for smooth closed curves τ and γ start-
ing at m0 ∈M, with γ being null-homotopic, the curve τ · γ · τ −1 is null-homotopic,
too. Thus, by (1.7.3), H 0
p (Γ ) is a normal subgroup of Hp(Γ ). To prove that the quo-
tient group Hp(Γ )/H 0
p (Γ ) is countable, we deﬁne a homomorphism F from the
fundamental group π1(M, m) of M based at m onto Hp(Γ )/H 0
p (Γ ) as follows: for a
given α ∈π1(M, m), let t →γ (t) be a piecewise smooth closed curve representing
α. We put F(α) := [ ˆγΓ ]. This mapping is well deﬁned: if γ1 and γ2 are two represen-
tatives of α, then γ1 ◦γ −1
2
is null-homotopic and thus deﬁnes an element of H 0
p (Γ ).
Clearly, it is surjective. Thus, F is a homomorphism onto Hp(Γ )/H 0
p (Γ ), indeed.
Now, countability of this quotient follows from the countability of π1(M, m).
■
Remark 1.7.11 By Theorem 1.7.9, Hp(Γ ) is a Lie subgroup of G whose connected
component of the identity coincides with H 0
p (Γ ). In particular, if M is simply
connected, then Hp(Γ ) is connected.

1.7 Parallel Transport and Holonomy

Proposition 1.7.12 Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle with connected base
manifold M and let Γ be a connection on P. Let p0 ∈P and let Pp0(Γ ) be the subset
of points in P which can be joined to p0 by a horizontal curve of Γ . Then,
1. Pp0(Γ ) is a reduction of P with structure group Hp0(Γ ).
2. The connection Γ is reducible to a connection on Pp0(Γ ).
Proof 1. Since M is connected, the restriction of π to Pp0(Γ ) is surjective. By
Proposition 1.7.8 and Remark 1.7.7, Pp0(Γ ) is invariant under the right action of the
Lie subgroup Hp0(Γ ) ⊂G and Pp0(Γ ) intersects the ﬁbres of P in Hp0(Γ )-orbits.
Next, we show that Pp0(Γ ) is a subbundle of P. For that purpose, let p ∈Pp0(Γ )
and let (U, κ) be a local chart at m = π(p) such that κ(U) is an open ball in Rdim M
and κ(m) = 0. For any ˜m ∈U, let t →γ (t) be the unique curve from m to ˜m such
that t →κ ◦γ (t) is the line segment from 0 to κ( ˜m). Deﬁne
s: U →P,
s( ˜m) := ˆγΓ (p).
Clearly, s is a smooth local section fulﬁlling s(U) ⊂Pp0(Γ ). Now, for every p ∈
π−1(U), there exists a unique element a ∈G such that p = Ψas(π(p)). Then,
˜χ : π−1(U) →U × G,
˜χ(p) := (π(p), a)
is a bijective mapping which induces a bijective mapping
χ : Pp0(Γ ) ∩π−1(U) →U × Hp0(Γ ).
Constructing, this way, a system of bijective mappings {(Ui, κi)} such that {Ui} is a
covering of M and requiring that the mappings χi be diffeomorphisms, we endow
Pp0(Γ ) with a manifold structure and with a system of local trivializations. To see
that Pp0(Γ ) is a submanifold of P, note that {π−1(Ui)} is a covering of Pp0(Γ ) with
open subsets of P such that every subset Pp0(Γ ) ∩π−1(U) is a submanifold of P.
This follows from the fact that Hp0(Γ ) is a submanifold of G and that the χi are
diffeomorphisms.
We conclude that Pp0(Γ ) is a reduction of P with structure group Hp0(Γ ) with
the corresponding morphism (ϑ, λ) given by the natural inclusion mappings ϑ :
Pp0(Γ ) →P and λ : Hp0(Γ ) →G.
2. Let p ∈Pp0(Γ ) and let X ∈Γp. Then, there exists a curve γ starting at π(p)
such that its horizontal lift γ h starting at p fulﬁls X = d
dt ↾0γ h(t). Since p can be joined
to p0 by a horizontal curve, we conclude that the image of γ h is contained in Pp0(Γ )
and that X ∈Tp

Pp0(Γ )

. Thus, for every p ∈Pp0(Γ ), the horizontal subspace Γp
is tangent to Pp0(Γ ). This means that the connection Γ is reducible to Pp0(Γ ): the
horizontal subspace at p ∈Pp0(Γ ) of the reduced connection is given by Γp.
■
Deﬁnition 1.7.13 The subbundle Pp0(Γ ) is called the holonomy bundle of Γ with
base point p0.

66

Fibre Bundles and Connections
NotethatPp0(Γ ) = Pp1(Γ )iffp0 andp1 maybejoinedbyahorizontalcurve.Thus,
for any pair (p0, p1) of points in P, we have either Pp0(Γ ) = Pp1(Γ ) or Pp0(Γ ) ∩
Pp1(Γ ) = ∅, that is, P decomposes into the union of disjoint holonomy bundles. One
can check that all holonomy bundles of a given connection are isomorphic (Exercise
1.7.4).
Remark 1.7.14 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle, let H ⊂G be a Lie subgroup
and let Q(M, H) be a reduction of P given by a morphism (ϑ, iH) with iH : H →G
being the natural inclusion mapping. Let Γ be a connection on P which is reducible
to a connection ˜Γ in Q. Then, by Proposition 1.3.13, ˜Γ deﬁnes a connection ˆΓ on P
(the image of ˜Γ under ϑ). Now, ˆΓ is either irreducible or not. In the ﬁrst case, ϑ(Q)
coincides with the holonomy bundle Pp(Γ ), p ∈ϑ(Q), and ˆΓ coincides with the
reduction of Γ to Pp(Γ ). In the second case, by Proposition 1.7.12, ˆΓ is reducible
to the holonomy bundle. Thus, in this case, for all p ∈ϑ(Q), we have
Pp(Γ ) ⊂ϑ(Q),
ˆΓ↾Pp(Γ ) = Γ↾Pp(Γ ).
Thus, the holonomy bundle is the smallest possible reduction of a principal bundle
with connection. In particular, a connection Γ on P is irreducible iff P = Pp(Γ ) and
G = Hp(Γ ) for all p ∈P.
♦
The following classical theorem characterizes the Lie algebra of the holonomy
group of a connection in terms of its curvature [18].
Theorem 1.7.15 (Ambrose-Singer) Let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle with
connected base manifold M and let Γ be a connection on P with connection form
ω and curvature form Ω. Let g be the Lie algebra of G. Then, for any p0 ∈P, the
Lie algebra hp0(Γ ) of the holonomy group Hp0(Γ ) coincides with the subspace of g
generated by elements of the form Ωp(X, Y), where p ∈Pp0(Γ ) and X, Y ∈Γp.
Proof ByProposition1.7.12,withoutlossofgeneralitywemayassumeHp0(Γ ) = G
and Pp0(Γ ) = P. Let
h = span

Ωp(X, Y) ∈g : p ∈Pp0(Γ ), X, Y ∈Γp

.
We must show that h = g. First, since Ω is a horizontal form of type Ad, the subspace
h is invariant under the adjoint action of G. Thus, h is an ideal in g. Next, consider
the distribution
p →Dp := Γp ⊕Ψ ′
p(h).
We show that D is involutive. Since Γp is spanned by horizontal vector ﬁelds and
Ψ ′
p(h) is spanned by Killing vector ﬁelds generated by elements of h, we must con-
sider the following three cases:
(a) Let A, B ∈h and let A∗and B∗be the corresponding Killing vector ﬁelds. Then,
[A, B] ∈h and since [A∗, B∗] = [A, B]∗, we have [A∗, B∗]p ∈Ψ ′
p(h).

1.7 Parallel Transport and Holonomy
67
(b) Let X be a horizontal vector ﬁeld and let A ∈h. Then, by Lemma 1.4.2, [X, A∗]
is a horizontal vector ﬁeld.
(c) Let X and Y be horizontal vector ﬁelds. Then, by (1.4.5),

Now, the Frobenius Theorem I/3.5.12 and Theorem I/3.5.17 yield the existence of a
maximal connected integral manifold N through p0 ∈P. A point p ∈P belongs to N
iff there exists a curve γ joining p to p0 such that ˙γ (t) ∈Dγ (t) for every t. Since Γ ⊂
TN, we conclude Pp0(Γ ) = P ⊂N. Thus, N = P and D = TP and, consequently,
dim g = dim P −dim M = dim N −dim M = dim h,
that is, g = h.
■
The proofs of the following statements are left to the reader (Exercise 1.7.5).
Remark 1.7.16
1. As already stated after Deﬁnition 1.7.13, P is a disjoint union of holonomy bun-
dles. By the proof of the Ambrose-Singer Theorem, this disjoint union coincides
with the foliation deﬁned by the distribution D.
2. If the curvature Ω of Γ vanishes, then H 0
p (Γ ) = {1} and each holonomy bundle
Pp(Γ ) is a covering of M. These bundles are all isomorphic and are associated
with the universal covering of M, which is a principal bundle with structure group
π1(M), cf. Example 1.1.26.
3. If the curvature Ω of Γ vanishes and if, additionally, M is simply connected, then
P is isomorphic to the trivial bundle M × G and the isomorphism maps Γ to the
canonical connection on M × G, cf. Example 1.3.18.
4. If G is connected, then Γ is irreducible iff hp0(Γ ) = g.
5. Using the Ambrose-Singer Theorem, one can show the following. For every
principal ﬁbre bundle P(M, G), with M connected and dim M ≥2, there exists
a connection Γ on P such that Pp(Γ ) = P for all p ∈P. For the rather technical
proof we refer to [490]. A direct, yet also technical proof can be found in [383],
see Chapter II/Theorem 8.2 of Part I.
♦
In the remainder of this section, we show that the concept of parallel transport
on a principal G-bundle P carries over to any associated vector bundle E = P ×G F
with (F, G, σ) being a representation of G.
As in the case of principal bundles, the horizontal lift of vectors implies the lift of
curves in M to horizontal curves in E. By (1.3.5), the unique lift of a curve γ in M
to the horizontal curve γ h
E in E starting at the point [(p, f )] ∈π−1
F (γ (0)) is given by
γ h
E(t) = ιf (γ h
P(t)),

where γ h
P is the horizontal lift of γ to P starting at p. The corresponding parallel
transport operators along γ will be denoted by
ˆγ Γ E(t) : π−1
F (γ (0)) →π−1
F (γ (t)).
As in the case of the principal bundle, for t = 1, we simply write ˆγ Γ E. For a given
horizontal lift γ h

ˆγ Γ E(t) = ιγ h

(1.7.8)
In particular, for closed curves in M, we can deﬁne the holonomy group

F (γ (0)))
(1.7.9)
and, correspondingly, the restricted holonomy group H 0

easy to show (Exercise 1.7.7) that for any p ∈π−1(m),
Hm(Γ E) = ιp ◦σ

(1.7.10)
In particular, if σ is injective, then Hm(Γ E) and Hp(Γ ) are isomorphic.
Finally, we relate the concept of parallel transport to the notion of parallelity of
sections, cf. Deﬁnition 1.4.5 and Corollary 1.5.7. For that purpose, let us denote the
subspace of sections of E which are parallel with respect to Γ E by P(E, Γ E). The
following proposition provides a geometric interpretation of the covariant derivative
in terms of parallel transport.
Proposition 1.7.17 Let Γ E be a connection on E, let ∇be its covariant derivative
and let Φ ∈Γ ∞(E). Then, for any m ∈M and any X ∈X(M),

we obtain a geometric interpretation of the covariant derivative. In particular, we
note that a section Φ is parallel iff the curve Φ ◦γ in E is horizontal for any integral
curve γ of X.
Now, let us consider an arbitrary smooth curve γ : I →M. By Deﬁnition 1.5.13, a
section of E along γ : I →M is a mapping φ : I →E fulﬁlling πF ◦φ = γ . Recall
that φ is a section of E along γ iff t →(t, φ(t)) is a section of γ ∗E, that is, there is a
canonical isomorphism between Γ ∞(γ ∗E) and the vector space Γ ∞
γ (E) of sections
of E along γ . Also recall that there is an associated covariant derivative along the
mapping γ . According to (1.5.16), it is given by
∇γ

φ = Φ ◦γ
is a section of E along γ and, for this choice of φ, formula (1.7.13) takes the form

γ is parallel iff

(1.7.15)
To summarize, we obtain the following.
Proposition 1.7.18 The parallel transport operator ˆγ Γ E : Eγ (0) →Eγ (1) along a
curve γ is given by the set of solutions of the differential equation (1.7.15) with the
initial condition Φ(γ (0)) running through the ﬁbre Eγ (0).

Remark 1.7.19 (Synchronous framing) For a vector bundle E →M with connection
∇, let ω be the connection form of ∇in the frame bundle L(E) and let Ω be its
curvature. Denote dim M = n and consider an open ball B ⊂Rn centered at 0. Let
x1, . . . , xn be the standard coordinates on B and let

be the corresponding radial vector ﬁeld on B. Let (U, κ) be a local chart sending U to
B. Via κ, parallel transport along rays t →tx, x ∈B, provides a local trivialization
of E over B by identifying the ﬁbres Ex with E0. The corresponding local frame is
said to be synchronous.
Let A = κ∗A be the local representative of ω on B with respect to a synchronous
frame {eα}, viewed as a local section of the frame bundle L(E), and let F = κ∗F be
the corresponding representative of Ω. Then, (1.5.6) implies
∇Xreα = Aβ
α(Xr) eβ = 0,
(1.7.16)
that is, (Xr⌟A) = 0. This implies
L Xr A = Xr⌟dA = Xr⌟F.
We decompose A = Ai dxi, F = 1
2Fij dxi ∧dxj. Then,
L Xr A = Fijxidxj.
On the other hand, by the derivation property of the Lie derivative,
L Xr A = Xr(Ai)dxi + Aidxi.
Comparing these two formulae, we read off
Xr(Ai) + Ai = −Fijxj .
This implies
Ai(x) ∼−1
2Fij(0)xj + 0(∥x∥2).
(1.7.17)
In particular, we have A(0) = 0.
♦
Finally, we show that the holonomy group of Γ E can be used to characterize the set
P(E, Γ E) of sections of E which are parallel with respect to Γ E. Given p ∈P, an
element of F is called holonomy-invariant if it is invariant under the restriction of
the representation σ to the holonomy group Hp(Γ ).
Proposition 1.7.20 (Holonomy principle) If M is connected, then there is a bijective
correspondence between P(E, Γ E) and the space of holonomy-invariant vectors
in F.
Proof Letm0 ∈M andp0 ∈π−1(m0).ByProposition1.7.12,P reducestogetherwith
Γ to the holonomy bundle Pp0(Γ ) and, by Proposition 1.6.7, we have the following
isomorphism of associated vector bundles:

1.7 Parallel Transport and Holonomy
71
E = P ×G F ∼= Pp0(Γ ) ×Hp0(Γ ) F.
Thus, it is enough to consider sections of the associated bundle on the right hand
side which are parallel in the sense of the reduced connection.
1. Let f ∈F be holonomy invariant, that is, σhf = f for all h ∈Hp0(Γ ). Deﬁne
˜Φ : Pp0(Γ ) →F,
˜Φ(p) := f .
(1.7.18)
Since, for all h ∈Hp0(Γ ), we have
˜Φ(Ψh(p)) = f = σh−1f = σh−1 ˜Φ(p),
˜Φ is Hp0(Γ )-equivariant. Thus, by Proposition 1.2.6, it induces a smooth section Φ
of E. Since ˜Φ is constant on Pp0(Γ ), we have Xh( ˜Φ) = Xh(f ) = 0 for any X ∈X(M).
Then, (1.5.3) implies that Φ is parallel.
2. Conversely, let Φ be a parallel section and let ˜Φ be the corresponding equivariant
mapping. By (1.5.3), we have Xh( ˜Φ) = 0 for every horizontal vector ﬁeld on Pp0(Γ ).
Thus, ˜Φ is constant along any horizontal curve in Pp0(Γ ), that is, ˜Φ is constant on
Pp0(Γ ). Let f := ˜Φ(p) ∈F be this constant vector. The equivariance of ˜Φ implies
the holonomy invariance of f .

Automorphisms
By Deﬁnition 1.1.7, if (ϑ, λ) is an automorphism of a principal G-bundle P, then
λ is an automorphism of G. In the sequel, we limit our attention to the restricted
class of automorphisms fulﬁlling λ = idG. This class corresponds to the equivariant
automorphisms of the G-manifold (P, G, Ψ ), cf. Deﬁnition I/6.1.1. We denote the
group of equivariant automorphisms by Aut(P). Recall from Remark 1.1.8/2 that an
automorphism ϑ of P is called vertical if ˜ϑ = idM.
Remark 1.8.1 The vertical automorphisms of P constitute a group which will be
denoted by AutM(P). By (1.1.4), the mapping Aut(P) ∋ϑ →˜ϑ ∈Diff(M) is a
homomorphism of groups and, by deﬁnition, AutM(P) coincides with the kernel
of this homomorphism. Thus, AutM(P) is a normal subgroup of Aut(P) and the
following sequence is exact,
0 →AutM(P) →Aut(P) →Diff(M).
In gauge theory, AutM(P) plays the role of the group of local gauge transformations.
It can be turned into an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert-Lie group, see Chaps.6 and 8.
♦
We start by giving a characterization of AutM(P) in terms of equivariant map-
pings which is useful in gauge theory. For a given principal bundle (P, G, M, Ψ, π),
consider the set HomG(P, G) of equivariant smooth mappings u : P →G, where G
is viewed as a right G-manifold endowed with the G-action by conjugation, that is,
(a, b) →b−1ab. Then, equivariance means
u(Ψa(p)) = a−1 u(p) a,
a ∈G, p ∈P.
(1.8.1)
We endow HomG(P, G) with a group structure by putting (uv)(p) := u(p) v(p) for
any u, v ∈HomG(P, G). Then,
(uv)(Ψa(p)) = u(Ψa(p)) v(Ψa(p)) = (a−1 u(p) a)(a−1 v(p) a) = a−1 (uv)(p) a,
showing that uv ∈HomG(P, G). The unit element is given by the constant mapping
p →1 and the inverse of u is given by the mapping p →u(p)−1.
Remark 1.8.2 By Proposition 1.2.6, HomG(P, G) may be identiﬁed with the space
of sections of the associated bundle P ×G G, with G acting on the typical ﬁbre G by
inner automorphisms.
♦

1.8 Automorphisms
73
For u ∈HomG(P, G), we deﬁne
ϑu : P →P,
ϑu(p) := Ψu(p)(p).
(1.8.2)
Proposition 1.8.3 For every u ∈HomG(P, G), the mapping ϑu deﬁned by (1.8.2) is
a vertical automorphism of P. The assignment u →ϑu deﬁnes an isomorphism of
groups.
Proof Since Ψ and u are smooth, ϑu : P →P is smooth as a composition of smooth
mappings. Then, ϑu−1 is also smooth and we have
ϑu−1 ◦ϑu(p) = Ψu(Ψu(p)(p))
−1 ◦Ψu(p)(p) = Ψu(p)−1 u(p)−1 u(p) ◦Ψu(p)(p) = p,
that is, ϑu−1 ◦ϑu = idP and, analogously, ϑu ◦ϑu−1 = idP. Thus, ϑu is a diffeomor-
phism. Moreover, by equivariance of u,
ϑu ◦Ψa(p) = Ψu(Ψa(p)) ◦Ψa(p)) = Ψa−1 u(p) a ◦Ψa(p)) = Ψa ◦ϑu(p),
showing that ϑu is an automorphism of P. By deﬁnition, it is vertical.
To prove the second assertion, we ﬁrst note that the mapping u →ϑu is a homo-
morphism of groups:
ϑu ◦ϑv(p) = Ψu(Ψv(p)(p)) ◦Ψv(p)(p) = Ψu(p) v(p)(p) = ϑuv(p).
Since the G-action Ψ is free, the mapping u →ϑu is injective. It is also surjective.
Indeed, let ϑ ∈AutM(P). Since ϑ(p) and p belong to the same ﬁbre, there exists a
unique element u(p) ∈G such that ϑ(p) = Ψu(p)(p). This yields a smooth mapping
u : P →G,
u(p) = Ψ −1
p
◦ϑ(p).
Finally, we must show the equivariance of u. On the one hand, we have
ϑ(Ψa(p)) = Ψu(Ψa(p)) ◦Ψa(p) = Ψa u(Ψa(p))(p)
and, on the other hand, by (1.1.3),
ϑ(Ψa(p)) = Ψa(ϑ(p)) = Ψa ◦Ψu(p)(p) = Ψu(p) a(p).
This yields a u(Ψa(p)) = u(p) a, that is, u(Ψa(p)) = a−1 u(p) a.
■
Next, we show that a vertical automorphism of P induces a vertical automorphism
in every associated bundle (P ×G F, M, πF).
Proposition 1.8.4 Let ϑ be a vertical automorphism of P. Then, the mapping
ˆϑ : P ×G F →P ×G F,
ˆϑ([(p, f )]) := [(ϑ(p), f )],

74

is a vertical automorphism of P ×G F. If ϑ is given by u ∈HomG(P, G), then
ˆϑu([(p, f )]) =

.
(1.8.3)

■
Corollary 1.8.5 If (F, G, σ) is a Lie group representation, then ˆϑ is a vertical
automorphism of vector bundles.
Proof Let m ∈M and let p ∈π−1(m). Formula (1.8.3) implies
( ˆϑu)↾π−1
F
(m) = ιp ◦σu(p)−1 ◦ι−1
p .
(1.8.4)
According to Proposition 1.2.8, the diffeomorphism ιp is a linear mapping. Thus,
(1.8.4) deﬁnes an endomorphism of the ﬁbre π−1
F (m).
■
Remark 1.8.6 From the proof of Proposition 1.8.4 we read off the following formula
for the local representative of ˆϑ:
ξ ◦ˆϑ ◦ξ −1(m, f ) = (m, σρ(m)f ).
(1.8.5)
Here, ρ = u ◦s denotes the local representative of u ∈HomG(P, G).
♦
We know from Corollary 1.3.16 that the image ϑ′(Γ ) and the preimage (ϑ−1)′(Γ )
of a connection Γ under an automorphism ϑ of P are both connections. In particular,
the image of a horizontal curve under ϑ is horizontal with respect to ϑ′(Γ ) and
formula (1.7.4) immediately implies the following transformation law for the parallel
transport operator:
ˆγϑ′(Γ ) = ϑ ◦ˆγΓ ◦ϑ−1.
(1.8.6)
Proposition 1.8.7 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle and let Γ be a connection on
P. Then, for ϑ ∈AutM(P) corresponding to u ∈HomG(P, G), one has the following
transformation laws:
1. If ω is the connection form of Γ , then ϑ∗ω is the connection form of (ϑ−1)′(Γ )
and
(ϑ∗ω)p = Ad(u(p)−1) ◦ωp + (u∗θ)p,
(1.8.7)
with θ denoting the Maurer-Cartan form on G.
2. If Ω is the curvature form of ω, then ϑ∗Ω is the curvature form of ϑ∗ω and
(ϑ∗Ω)p = Ad(u(p)−1) ◦Ωp.

3. For the operator of covariant exterior derivative, one has
Dϑ∗ω = ϑ∗◦Dω ◦(ϑ∗)−1.
(1.8.9)
Proof 1. To prove (1.8.7), we must calculate ϑ′(X) for X ∈TpP. Let γ be a curve
representing X. Then, using (1.8.2), we have
ϑ′
p(X) = d

p(X).
The second term describes a vertical vector in ϑ(p). Thus, we may write it in the
form Ψ ′
ϑ(p)(A) with A ∈g. Explicitly, since u′
p(X) ∈Tu(p)G, we can write
Ψ ′
p ◦u′
p(X) = Ψ ′
p ◦L′
u(p) ◦L′
u(p)−1 ◦u′
p(X).
Using

u(p)−1 ◦u′
p(Y) = θ(u′
p(X)) = (u∗θ)p(X)
and Ψp ◦Lu(p) = Ψϑ(p), we obtain

u∗θ(X)

.
(1.8.10)
Using this equation, together with the equivariance of ω, we obtain (1.8.7).
2. Using the Structure Equation, we obtain
ϑ∗Ω = ϑ∗(dω + 1
2[ω, ω]) = d(ϑ∗ω) + 1
2[ϑ∗ω, ϑ∗ω],
that is, ϑ∗Ω is the curvature form of ϑ∗ω, indeed. To prove (1.8.8), we must calculate
ϑ∗Ω(X, Y) for any X, Y ∈TpP. For that purpose, we use the decomposition (1.8.10)
for both tangent vectors. Since Ω is horizontal, only the ﬁrst terms of this decom-
position contribute. Then, using the equivariance of Ω, one immediately obtains
(1.8.8).
3. Using the horizontality of the covariant exterior derivative and the fact that ϑ∗ω
is the connection form of (ϑ−1)′(Γ ), we obtain
ϑ′ ◦horϑ∗ω = horω ◦ϑ′

76

and thus
(Dϑ∗ω(ϑ∗˜α))(X0, . . . , Xk) = (ϑ∗Dω ˜α)(X0, . . . , Xk),
for any ˜α ∈Ωk
σ,hor(P, F) and Xi ∈TpP. This yields the assertion.
■
Remark 1.8.8
1. Sometimes, we will use the following short-hand notation for the above transfor-
mation laws:
ϑ∗ω = Ad(u−1) ◦ω + u∗θ,
ϑ∗Ω = Ad(u−1) ◦Ω.
In matrix notation, we have u∗θ = u−1du, cf. Remark I/5.5.12/2. Then,
ϑ∗ω = u−1ωu + u−1du,
ϑ∗Ω = u−1Ωu.
2. Using the local representative ρ = u ◦s, introduced in Remark 1.8.6, from (1.8.7)
and (1.8.8) we read off the following transformation laws for the local represen-
tatives of ω and Ω, cf. formulae (1.3.11) and (1.4.16):
A ′ = Ad(ρ−1) ◦A + ρ∗θ,
F ′ = Ad(ρ−1) ◦F.

1.9
Invariant Connections
In this section, we consider the following geometrical setting. Let there be given a
principal bundle (P, G, M, Ψ, π) and let the base manifold M be endowed with a
left Lie group action (M, K, δ). Assume that both K and G are compact19 connected
Lie groups. By a lift of the K-action to P we mean a homomorphism Δ : K →
Aut(P) projecting to δ, that is, π ◦Δk = δk ◦π for any k ∈K. The following natural
problems arise:
(a) Classify the lifts of the K-actions.
(b) Classify the connections on P which are invariant under a lifted K-action.
In pure mathematics, these problems are a natural part of ﬁbre bundle theory. We
will cite a number of relevant contributions later on. In physics, these questions are
closely related to model building in the spirit of Kaluza-Klein theories, see Sects.7.8
and 7.9. We also refer to Chap.6 for various applications. Here, we address the above
problems under the following additional assumptions.
(a) We assume that the K-action δ have only one orbit type. In the sequel, such an
action will be referred to as a simple K-action.
19It will become clear below for which statements the compactness assumption is necessary. In
particular, under this assumption the K-action δ is proper.

1.9 Invariant Connections
77
(b) Since Δk is an automorphism of P for every k ∈K, the actions Ψ and Δ commute
and thus they induce a left action,
ρ : (K × G) × P →P,
ρ(k,g)(p) := Δk ◦Ψg−1(p).
(1.9.1)
We assume that this action be simple, too.
Let us denote the orbit type of δ by [H] and let us consider a representative H
of the conjugacy class [H]. In the notation of Sect.6.6. of Part I, let NK(H) be the
normalizer of H in K and let ΓH = NK(H)/H. Recall that ΓH acts on K/H naturally
from the left,
ΓH × K/H →K/H,
(aH, kH) →ka−1H.
(1.9.2)
By Proposition I/6.6.1, the subset MH ⊂M of isotropy type H is a principal ΓH-
bundle over the orbit space ˆM ≡M/K with right ΓH-action (a, m) →δa−1(m) and
δ induces a K-equivariant diffeomorphism
MH ×ΓH K/H →M,
[(m, [k])] →δk(m),
(1.9.3)
with the K-action on MH ×ΓH K/H given by left translation on K/H.
Now, let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be a principal bundle, with G compact connected, and
let Δ : K →Aut(P) be a lift of δ. Then, for every isotropy group H, the submanifold
π−1(MH) ⊂P is a principal G-bundle over MH and the restriction of Δ to H deﬁnes a
homomorphism from H to AutMH(π−1(MH)). By Proposition 1.8.3, the latter induces
a mapping λ : H × π−1(MH) →G, given by
Δh(p) = Ψλ(h,p)(p),
π(p) ∈MH, h ∈H.
(1.9.4)
For every h ∈H, the induced mapping λh : π−1(MH) →G is G-equivariant,
λh(Ψg(p)) = g−1λh(p)g,
(1.9.5)
and, for every p ∈π−1(MH), the induced mapping λp : H →G is a homomorphism
of Lie groups. By (1.9.5), a change of the point in a given ﬁbre of π−1(MH) results
in a conjugate homomorphism, that is,
λΨg(p) = g−1λpg.
(1.9.6)
By assumption, the left action ρ of K × G on P given by (1.9.1) is simple. Let
us calculate the isotropy group (K × G)p for a chosen point p ∈π−1(MH). From
Δk ◦Ψg−1(p) = p we read off δk(π(p)) = π(p), that is, k ∈H. Thus, using (1.9.4),
we obtain
(K × G)p =

(h, λp(h)) ∈K × G : h ∈H

Fibre Bundles and Connections
Now, let us choose an isotropy subgroup I and let us consider the subset
PI ⊂π−1(MH) ⊂P
of isotropy type I. By deﬁnition of PI, the restriction of the mapping p →λ(h, p) to
PI is constant. In the sequel, it will be denoted by λ0. Denoting
ΓI = NK×G(I)/I
and, again using Proposition I/6.6.1, we conclude that PI is a principal ΓI-bundle
over the orbit space P/(K × G) = ˆM with right ΓI-action
Ψ I : ΓI × PI →PI,
(a, p) →Ψ I(a, p) := ρa−1(p),
(1.9.8)
and that ρ induces a (K × G)-equivariant diffeomorphism
PI ×ΓI (K × G)/I →P,
[(p, [(k, g)])] →ρ(k,g)(p).
(1.9.9)
Thus, a principal G-bundle P admitting a simple lift of a simple K-action has the
form
P = PI ×ΓI (K × G)/I,
(1.9.10)
where I is a chosen isotropy group of the induced action ρ.
Remark 1.9.1 If we take another representative I′ = aIa−1, a ∈K × G, of the orbit
type [I], then the isotropy submanifold PI gets translated by a, that is, PI′ = ρa(PI).
Thus, P is uniquely characterized by an equivalence class [(I, PI)].
♦
The following remark shows that, depending on the context, formula (1.9.10) may
be interpreted in various ways.
Remark 1.9.2
1. By (1.9.7), the action of I on K × G may be identiﬁed with the action of H given
by
H × (K × G) →K × G,
(h, (k, g)) →(kh, gλ0(h)).
(1.9.11)
Thus, we can write
(K × G)/I = K ×H G,
(1.9.12)
where K is viewed as a principal H-bundle over K/H.
2. Consider K × G as a principal NK×G(I)-bundle over (K × G)/NK×G(I). Since
I ⊂NK×G(I) is a normal subgroup, by Corollary I/6.5.3/1, the right action of
NK×G(I) on K × G descends to a free proper action of ΓI = NK×G(I)/I on
(K × G)/I and idK×G induces a diffeomorphism between (K × G)/NK×G(I) and

(K × G)/I

/ΓI. Thus, (K × G)/I may be viewed as a principalΓI-bundle over

1.9 Invariant Connections
79
(K × G)/NK×G(I) and the isomorphism (1.9.9) may be rewritten as follows:
P ∼= (K × G)/I ×ΓI PI.
(1.9.13)
♦
Next, we will show that from the above data, we can construct a principal G-
bundle admitting the lift of a simple K-action. For that purpose, we must gain some
insight into the structure of ΓI = NK×G(I)/I and of PI, respectively. First, note that
(k, g) ∈NK×G(I) iff
k ∈NK(H),
gλ0(h)g−1 = λ0(khk−1) for all h ∈H.
(1.9.14)
Next, consider the centralizer CG(λ0(H)). By (1.9.14), we have
NK×G(I) ∩({1K} × G) = {1K} × CG(λ0(H)) ≡Z.
(1.9.15)
Since Z ∩I = {1K × 1G}, we may view Z as a (normal) subgroup of ΓI. Thus, Z
acts freely on PI and, by (1.9.15), transitively on each intersection of PI with a ﬁbre
of P. We conclude that PI carries the structure of a principal Z-bundle over
MI := π(PI) ∼= PI/Z,
with the right action of Z given by restriction of Ψ to Z × PI ⊂G × P. Clearly,
MI ⊂MH and thus
ΓI/Z ⊂ΓH.
(1.9.16)
To summarize, we have a sequence of principal bundles
PI
πMI
−→MI
π ˆM
−→ˆM,
(1.9.17)
with structure groups Z and ΓI/Z, respectively. Let us denote the Lie algebras of,
respectively,
K, H, NK(H), ΓH, G, I, NK×G(I), ΓI, Z
by k, h, nH, ˆnH, g, i, nI, ˆnI, z.
Lemma 1.9.3 The Lie algebra ˆnI of ΓI is the direct sum of two ideals,
ˆnI = ˆnH ⊕z.
(1.9.18)
Proof Let [(A, B)] ∈ˆnI. Then, by (1.9.14), A ∈nH. Since K is compact, we can
decompose
nH = h ⊕h⊥
(1.9.19)

with respect to some Ad-invariant scalar product in k. By invariance and since h is
an ideal, h⊥is an ideal and thus (1.9.19) is a decomposition into a direct sum of Lie
algebras. Clearly, we may choose A ∈h⊥. Then, [A, X] = 0 for any X ∈h. Now, for
any B ∈z, the second equation of (1.9.14) implies
[B, λ′
0(X)] = λ′
0([A, X]) = 0.
■
From (1.9.18) we read off that the connected components of the identity of ΓI/Z and
ΓH coincide,
(ΓI/Z)0 = (ΓH)0,
(1.9.20)
and, using (1.9.16), we conclude that ΓI/Z is the union of a number of connected
components of ΓH. In particular, ΓH/(ΓI/Z) is a discrete group.
Lemma 1.9.4 The manifold MI is a reduction of the principal ΓH-bundle MH →ˆM
to the closed subgroup ΓI/Z and we have the following isomorphism of associated
bundles:
MH ×ΓH K/H ∼= MI ×ΓI/Z K/H.
(1.9.21)
Proof Note that MH/(ΓI/Z) may be viewed as a section of the associated bundle
MH ×ΓI/Z ΓH/(ΓI/Z). By Corollary 1.6.5, this section deﬁnes a reduction of MH to
the closed subgroup ΓI/Z. Thus, MI is a reduction of MH to ΓI/Z. The isomorphism
(1.9.21) follows from Proposition 1.6.7.
■
We conclude from (1.9.21) that, via the K-equivariant diffeomorphism (1.9.3), we
may identify M with MI ×ΓI/Z K/H. Now, we can prove the announced converse
statement.
Proposition 1.9.5 Let K and G be compact connected Lie groups and let (M, K, δ)
be a simple Lie group action. Let H ⊂K be an isotropy subgroup of δ and let
λ0 : H →G be a Lie group homomorphism. Let ( ˆP, ΓI, ˆM, ˆΨ , ˆπ) be a principal
bundle, where I = {(h, λ0(h)) ∈K × G : h ∈H} and ΓI = NK×G(I)/I. Then, the
bundle
P = ˆP ×ΓI (K × G)/I
(1.9.22)
associated with ˆP carries the structure of a principal G-bundle over M, where G acts
by inverse left translation on the factor G. The natural K-action Δ on P given by
left translation on (K × G)/I yields a group homomorphism Δ : K →Aut(P) and
projects onto δ.
Proof First, we show that P carries the structure of a principal G-bundle over M.
The right G-action is deﬁned by
G × P →P,
Ψ (a, [(ˆp, [(k, g)])]) := [(ˆp, [(k, a−1g)])].
This action is obviously free. The canonical bundle projection is deﬁned as the
projection onto the orbit space of this action, π : P →P/G. We must show that the

1.9 Invariant Connections
81
orbit space is diffeomorphic to M. Since G is compact, the action Ψ is proper and
thus, as explained in Sect.6.5 of Part I, the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem I/6.4.3
implies that (P, G, P/G, Ψ, π) is a principal bundle. Next, we have the sequence
(1.9.17) with PI replaced by ˆP and, thus, ˆP/Z = MI. Using this and the fact that Z
is normal in ΓI, we obtain
P/G = ˆP ×ΓI K/H = ˆP/Z ×ΓI/Z K/H = MI ×ΓI/Z K/H.
Thus, using (1.9.21) and (1.9.3), we obtain P/G = M. Finally, P can be endowed
with the natural left K-action
Δ : K × P →P,
Δ(l, [(ˆp, [(k, g)])]) := [(ˆp, [(lk, g)])],
which obviously commutes with the G-action and which projects onto δ.
■
Remark 1.9.6 As in Remark 1.9.1, we may pass to another subgroup I′ = aIa−1,
a ∈K × G.Correspondingly,ΓI′ isisomorphictoΓI.ChoosingaprincipalΓI′-bundle
ˆP′ which is vertically isomorphic to ˆP, the construction yields a principal bundle P′
isomorphic to P.
♦
Next, we discuss two important special cases. First, we consider the classical case
of a transitive K-action, see [383, 647].
Remark 1.9.7
1. If δ is transitive, then ρ is also transitive. Thus, in this case, ˆM and, therefore,
also PI/ΓI is the one-point space and, by (1.9.12), formula (1.9.22) reduces to
P = K ×H G,
(1.9.23)
where K is viewed as a principal H-bundle over K/H. Thus, in the transitive case,
principal G-bundles admitting a lift of a K-action are completely characterized
by Lie group homomorphisms λ0 : H →G.
2. The bundle P given by (1.9.23) is trivial iff λ0 extends to a smooth mapping
˜λ0 : K →G fulﬁlling ˜λ0(kh) = ˜λ0(k)λ0(h) for k ∈K and h ∈H (Exercise 1.9.2).
3. If the action of K is free, then λ0 is the trivial homomorphism and thus P is a
trivial bundle. This means that a principal bundle over a Lie group K admits a lift
of the natural action of K on itself by left translation iff it is trivial.
4. The triples (K, P(M, G), Δ), where K is a Lie group, P(M, G) is a principal
G-bundle over a homogeneous K-space M and Δ is an action of K on P by
automorphisms which projects to the transitive K-action on M, form a category,
called the category of homogeneous principal bundles. Correspondingly, one may
consider the category of homogeneous principal bundles with base point p ∈P.
As a consequence of Proposition 1.9.5, in the latter category, every object is
isomorphic to (K, P(K/H, G), Δ) with base point (1K, 1G), see [634] for details.
♦

Fibre Bundles and Connections
Before we proceed to a more general case, we give an example illustrating that a
lift does not always exist, see [632]. For a discussion of the lifting problem we refer
to [89, 256, 266, 486, 502].
Example 1.9.8 Put K = SO(3), G = U(1) and M = S2, endowed with the natural
action of K. Then, H = SO(2) ∼= U(1) and we must consider homomorphisms
λ : U(1) →U(1). It is well known that such homomorphisms are labelled by the
integers, that is, they are of the form λn(z) = zn, with z ∈U(1) and n ∈Z. Thus, for
n > 0, we obtain
Pn = SO(3) ×U(1) U(1) ∼= SO(3)/Zn ∼= SU(2)/Z2n.
These are the even 3-dimensional lens spaces. In particular, for n = 1, the bundle
manifold is SO(3). For n = 0 the bundle manifold is S2 × U(1). We conclude that the
complex Hopf bundle S3(S2, U(1)) does not admit a lift of the natural SO(3)-action
on S2.
♦
The following case was considered in various versions in [284, 285, 539, 546].
Remark 1.9.9 Assume that the principal ΓI/Z-bundle20 MI →ˆM is trivial. Then,
we may choose a global section s : ˆM →MI. Let us denote ˜M := s( ˆM) and
˜P := π−1( ˜M) ∩PI = (πMI)−1( ˜M).
By construction, ˜P is a subbundle of PI( ˆM, ΓI) carrying the structure of a principal
Z-bundle. In particular, since ˜M and ˆM may be identiﬁed via the section s, this yields
a reduction of PI to the structure group Z. Thus, by Proposition 1.6.7,
PI ×ΓI (K × G)/I = ˜P ×Z (K × G)/I.
Since Z = {1K} × CG(λ0(H)) ⊂ΓI, the action of I on K × G commutes with the
action of Z on this product. Thus,
˜P ×Z (K × G)/I ∼= K ×H

˜P ×CG(λ0(H)) G

,
where H acts on ˜P ×CG(λ0(H)) G by right translation on the factor G via λ0. Viewing the
twisted product ˜P ×CG(λ0(H)) G as a bundle associated with the principal CG(λ0(H))-
bundle G(CG(λ0(H)), G/CG(λ0(H))), we ﬁnally obtain
P ∼= K ×H

G ×CG(λ0(H)) ˜P

(1.9.24)
with the right H-action on K ×

(h, (k, [(g, ˜p)]) →(kh, [(gλ0(h), ˜p)]),
h ∈H,
cf. [539]. The diffeomorphism (1.9.24) is induced from (1.9.9) in an obvious way:
[(k, [(g, ˜p)])] →Δk ◦Ψg−1(˜p).
By Remark 1.9.6, passing from λ0 to a conjugate homomorphism yields an isomor-
phic principal G-bundle P.
♦
Next, we will use the above results to classify G-invariant connections in the present
context.
Deﬁnition 1.9.10 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle and let Δ : K →Aut(P) be
a group homomorphism. A connection form ω on P is called K-invariant if for all
k ∈K
Δ∗
kω = ω.
The following result yields the classiﬁcation of invariant connections for the case of
simple group actions. It belongs to Jadczyk and Pilch [345]. To formulate it, we need
a reductive decomposition
k = nH ⊕p,
(1.9.25)
whose existence is guaranteed by the compactness of K. Let L(p, g) be the space of
linear mappings from p to g. Note that L(p, g) is endowed with a natural NK×G(I)-
action given by
NK×G(I) × L(p, g) →L(p, g),
([(k, g)], F) →Ad(g) ◦F ◦Ad(k−1),
and that this action descends to a ΓI-action on the subspace L(p, g)H ⊂L(p, g) of
H-invariant elements, that is, linear mappings fulﬁlling
F = Ad(λ0(h)) ◦F ◦Ad(h−1),
h ∈H.
(1.9.26)
Theorem 1.9.11 Let (M, K, δ) be a simple Lie group action, let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be
a principal bundle admitting a lift Δ : K →Aut(P) of the K-action. Then, there is a
one-to-one correspondence between K-invariant connection forms ω on P and pairs
( ˆω, ˆΦ), where ˆω is a z-valued 1-form of type Ad on PI( ˆM, ΓI) fulﬁlling
ˆωp(A∗) = A,
A ∈z, p ∈PI,
(1.9.27)
and ˆΦ : PI →L(p, g)H is a ΓI-equivariant mapping.
Proof 1. Let ω be K-invariant. According to Remark 1.9.2/2, we may view P as a
bundle associated with the principal ΓI-bundle
(K × G)/I →(K × G)/NK×G(I).
(1.9.28)

Fibre Bundles and Connections
Since G is compact, we may decompose g into z and its orthogonal complement
g = z ⊕z⊥.
(1.9.29)
Clearly, this decomposition is reductive. Using the decompositions (1.9.25) and
(1.9.29), together with nH = h ⊕ˆnH, we obtain
T[1]((K × G)/I) = (ˆnH ⊕z) ⊕(p ⊕z⊥).
(1.9.30)
Since the decompositions (1.9.25) and (1.9.29) are reductive, this decomposition is
reductive, too. Using (1.9.18), we obtain
T[1]

(K × G)/NK×G(I)

= p ⊕z⊥.
(1.9.31)
By Example 1.3.19, p ⊕z⊥deﬁnes a connection on the principal bundle (1.9.28),
which in turn induces a connection on the associated bundle (K × G)/I ×ΓI PI. By
(1.9.9), the corresponding splitting of the tangent bundle TP is pointwise given by
Tρ(k,g)(p)P = ρ′
(k,g)

TpPI ⊕ρ′
p(p ⊕z⊥)

,
(1.9.32)
where (k, g) ∈NK×G(I) and p ∈PI (Exercise 1.9.1). The ﬁrst summand in (1.9.32)
is vertical and the second one is the horizontal subspace of the induced connection.
With respect to this splitting, every 1-form α on P may be decomposed into its vertical
and horizontal parts,
α = αv + αh,
and the horizontal part may be further decomposed as
αh = αp + αz⊥.
We deﬁne
ˆω := (ωv)↾PI .
(1.9.33)
Using the K-invariance of ω and (1.9.4), on PI we obtain
ωp = (Δ∗
hω)p = (Ψ ∗
λ0(h)ω)p = Ad(λ0(h)−1)ωp,
for every p ∈PI and every h ∈H. Thus, ˆω takes values in z. By point 3 of Proposition
1.3.5 and, again, by K-invariance of ω,
ρ∗
(k,g) ˆω = Ad(g) ◦ˆω,
(k, g) ∈NK×G(I).
Since ˆω is z-valued and z ⊂ˆnI = ˆnH ⊕z, we may rewrite this relation as follows:

85
(Ψ I)∗
a ˆω = Ad(a−1) ◦ˆω,
a ∈ΓI,
(1.9.34)
showing that ˆω is of type Ad. Finally, formula (1.9.27) is an immediate consequence
of point 2 of Proposition 1.3.5. Next, we deﬁne
Φ : PI →(p ⊕z⊥)∗⊗g,
Φ(p) := ρ∗
p

(ωh)↾PI

,
p ∈PI,
where ρp : NK×G(I) →PI is deﬁned by restriction. Since
ρ′
p(p ⊕z⊥) = Δ′
p(p) ⊕Ψ ′
p(z⊥),
the two horizontal components are
ˆΦ : PI →p∗⊗g = L(p, g),
ˆΦ(p) := Δ∗
p

(ωp)↾PI

(1.9.35)
and
ˇΦ : PI →(z⊥)∗⊗g = L(z⊥, g),
ˇΦ(p) := Ψ ∗
p

(ωz⊥)↾PI

.
Here, as above, Δp and Ψp stand for the appropriate restrictions. We show that ˆΦ
is ΓI-equivariant and that ˇΦ is constant and equal to the identical mapping on z⊥.
Using the G-equivariance and the K-invariance of ω, together with
ρ′
ρ(k,g)(p)(A, B) = ρ′
(k,g) ◦ρ′


Ad(k−1)A, Ad(g−1)B

Thus,
ˆΦ(ρ(k,g)(p)) = Ad(g) ◦ˆΦ(p) ◦Ad(k−1),
(1.9.36)
showing the NK×G(I)-equivariance of ˆΦ, and
ˇΦ(ρ(k,g)(p))(B) = Ad(g) ◦ωz⊥
p (Ψ ′
p(Ad(g−1)B)) = B.
Finally, the H-invariance of ˆΦ(p) follows immediately: for (h, λ0(h)) ∈I we have
ρ(h,λ0(h))(p) = p for all h ∈H, and thus (1.9.36) implies
ˆΦ(p) = Ad(λ0(h)) ◦ˆΦ(p) ◦Ad(h−1).

Thus, ˆΦ is ΓI-equivariant.
2. Conversely, let ( ˆω, ˆΦ) be a pair of objects deﬁned on the principal bundle
PI( ˆM, ΓI) with the desired properties. Using the (K × G)-equivariant diffeomor-
phism
P ∼= PI ×ΓI (K × G)/I
given by (1.9.9), we extend ˆΦ by the constant mapping ˇΦ : PI →idz⊥to a mapping
Φ : PI →(p ⊕z⊥)∗⊗g,
Φ := ˆΦ + ˇΦ,
and use (1.9.32) to deﬁne
ωp(Z) := ˆωp(X) + Φ(p)(A, B),
with p ∈PI and Z = X + ρ′
p(A, B) ∈TpP. Finally, we extend ω to P via ρ. The proof
that this yields a well-deﬁned K-invariant connection form on P is left to the reader
(Exercise 1.9.3).
■
Remark 1.9.12
1. Combining Theorem 1.9.11 with Proposition 1.9.5, one ﬁnds that pairs (P, ω),
where P is a principal bundle over M admitting a lift of the K-action and ω is
a K-invariant connection, are in bijective correspondence with triples ( ˆP, ˆω, ˆΦ),
where ˆP is a principal ΓI-bundle, ˆω is a z-valued 1-form of type Ad on ˆP fulﬁlling
(1.9.27) and ˆΦ : ˆP →L(p, g)H is a ΓI-equivariant mapping.
2. Note that ˆω is is not a connection form on PI( ˆM, ΓI), because point 2 of Proposi-
tion 1.3.5 need not be fulﬁlled for elements A ∈ˆnI. On the other hand, owing to
the fact that Z ⊂ΓI, formula (1.9.34) holds for any a ∈Z. Together with (1.9.27),
this implies that ˆω is a connection form on PI viewed as a principal Z-bundle
over MI.
3. Let μ be a connection form on the principal ΓI/Z-bundle π ˆM : MI →ˆM. Deﬁne
ˆτ := ˆω −ˆω ◦π∗
MIμ + π∗
MIμ,
(1.9.37)
where
ˆω ◦π∗
MIμ : TpPI →ˆnI,
ˆω ◦π∗
MIμ(X) := ˆω((μ(π′
MI(X))∗).
Here, μ(π′
MI(X)) is viewed as an element of ˆnI via (1.9.18). It is easy to see
that ˆτ is a connection form on PI( ˆM, ΓI) (Exercise 1.9.4). This shows that any
connection form on MI( ˆM, ΓI/Z) completes the connection form ˆω on PI(MI, Z)
to a connection form on PI( ˆM, ΓI).
4. The H-invariance condition (1.9.26) for ˆΦ(p), p ∈PI, may be rewritten as
ˆΦ(p) ◦Ad(h) = Ad(λ0(h)) ◦ˆΦ(p),
h ∈H.
(1.9.38)

1.9 Invariant Connections
87
In this form, it means that the linear mapping ˆΦ(p) is an operator intertwining the
restrictionsoftheadjointrepresentationsofK andGtoH actingonmandtoλ0(H)
acting on g, respectively. Under the canonical identiﬁcation L(p, g) = p∗⊗g,
condition (1.9.26) takes the form

Ad∗(h) ⊗Ad(λ0(h))
 ˆΦ(p) = ˆΦ(p).
♦
Let us apply Theorem 1.9.11 to the two special cases treated before. First, let us
consider the case of a transitive K-action addressed in Remark 1.9.7. By this remark,
principal G-bundles admitting a lift of the K-action are completely characterized by
Lie group homomorphisms λ0 : H →G and have the following structure:
P = K ×H G.
In this case, ˆM is the one-point space and thus the principal ΓI-bundle PI coincides
with the principal Z-bundle ΓI →ΓI/Z. Consequently, by (1.9.34) and (1.9.27), ˆω is
a ΓI-invariant connection form on this bundle and, therefore, by (1.9.18), it is given
by a linear mapping ˆφ : ˆnH →z. Since Ad(H) acts trivially on ˆnH, this mapping is
H-invariant. To summarize, if we denote
m = ˆnH ⊕p,
(1.9.39)
thenk = h ⊕mandwemaymerge ˆφ and ˆΦ toanH-equivariant mapping ˜Φ : m →g,
that is, a mapping fulﬁlling
˜Φ ◦Ad(h) = Ad(λ0(h)) ◦˜Φ,
h ∈H.
(1.9.40)
This way, we get the following classical result of Wang [647].
Corollary 1.9.13 (Wang) If the K-action is transitive, then K-invariant connections
on P are in one-to-one correspondence with H-equivariant linear mappings ˜Φ :
m →g.
■
Some details of the proofs of the statements contained in the following remark are
left to the reader (Exercise 1.9.5).
Remark 1.9.14
1. For later purposes, we give an explicit reconstruction formula for the K-invariant
connections described by Corollary 1.9.13. Choose p0 = [(1K, 1G)] ∈K ×H G.
Then, any tangent vector Zp0 ∈Tp0(K ×H G) may be written as
Zp0 = [(A, B)],
A ∈k, B ∈g,
and, for any p ∈K ×H G, there exist elements k ∈K and g ∈G such that

88

p0 = Δk ◦Ψg(p).
We deﬁne
ωp(Z) = Ad(g)

λ′
0(Ah) + ˜Φ(Am) + B

,
(1.9.41)
where Ah ∈h and Am ∈m are the components of A with respect to the decom-
position k = h ⊕m. It is easy to show that ω is a (correctly deﬁned) K-invariant
connection form on K ×H G, indeed.
2. Clearly, among the invariant connections labeled by ˜Φ there is a distinguished
element, deﬁned by
˜Φ = 0.
(1.9.42)
By (1.9.41), it is given by
ωp(Z) = Ad(g)

λ′
0(Ah) + B

,
(1.9.43)
that is, it is uniquely determined by the homomorphism λ0. Therefore, it is called
the canonical invariant connection on P.
3. In the transitive case, the compactness assumptions on K and G may be dropped.
Then, in general, there is no reductive decomposition (1.9.25) and the (slightly
more general) classiﬁcation reads as follows: K-invariant connection forms are in
one-to-onecorrespondencewithH-invariantlinearmappings  : k →gfulﬁlling
(A) = λ′
0(A) for any A ∈h.
4. Using the Structure Equation, it is easy to calculate the curvature Ω of a K-
invariant connection form. Clearly, it sufﬁces to calculate Ω on Killing vector
ﬁelds of K. This yields
Ω(A∗, A′
∗) = [(A), (A′)] −([A, A′]),
A, A′ ∈k.
Thus, a K-invariant connection is ﬂat iff  is a Lie algebra homomorphism.
♦
Application of Theorem 1.9.11 to the case addressed in Remark 1.9.9 yields the
following, see [546].
Corollary 1.9.15 If the principal ΓI/Z-bundle MI →ˆM is trivial, then K-invariant
connections on P are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs ( ˜ω, ˜Φ), where
1. ˜ω is a connection form on the principal CG(λ0(H))-bundle ˜P over ˜M,
2.
˜Φ : ˜P →L(m, g)H is a CG(λ0(H))-equivariant mapping.
Proof Since ΓI acts freely on PI and Z is a normal subgroup of ΓI we have the
following diffeomorphism:
ϕ : ˜P ×Z ΓI →PI
ϕ([(˜p, a)]) := ρa(˜p).
(1.9.44)
Using this identiﬁcation and (1.9.18), we get a splitting of the tangent bundle,

1.9 Invariant Connections
89
Tρa(˜p)PI = ρ′
a

T˜p ˜P ⊕Δ′
˜p(ˆnH)
 
.
(1.9.45)
Decomposing ˆω with respect to this splitting yields a pair ( ˜ω, ˆφ), where ˜ω is a
connection form on ˜P and ˆφ is a mapping given by
ˆφ : ˜P →(ˆnH)∗⊗z,
ˆφ(˜p)(A) = ˆω(Δ′
˜p(A)),
A ∈ˆnH.
(1.9.46)
Finally, as above, merging ˆφ with ˆΦ we get a mapping
˜Φ : ˜P →(m)∗⊗g,
fulﬁlling
˜Φ(˜p) ◦Ad(h) = Ad(λ0(h)) ◦˜Φ(˜p),
h ∈H.
(1.9.47)
Conversely, given a pair ( ˜ω, ˜Φ), one ﬁrst reconstructs the pair ( ˆω, ˆΦ) and then, using
Theorem 1.9.11, the invariant connection ω.
■
Remark 1.9.16
1. By construction, see (1.9.35) and (1.9.46), ˜Φ is given by
˜Φ(˜p)(A) = ω˜p(Δ′
˜p(A)) = Δ∗
˜p(ω)(A),
A ∈m.
(1.9.48)
2. Comparing with point 3 of Remark 1.9.12, in this case, the connection form μ is
simply given by the section s : ˆM →MI, cf. Example 1.3.18.
♦
To conclude this section, we discuss two simple examples of the above type which
are relevant in physics.
Example 1.9.17 (Rotational invariance) Consider the deﬁning representation of
SO(3) on R3 or, equivalently, the adjoint representation of SU(2) under the identiﬁ-
cation R3 ∼= su(2).21 If we remove the origin, we have R3 \ {0} ∼= R+ × S2 and thus
we deal with the situation described by Remark 1.9.9 and Corollary 1.9.15, with
G = SU(2),
K = SU(2),
H = U(1),
˜M = R+.
Let us classify the K-invariant SU(2)-connections over R3 \ {0}.
(a) Principal SU(2)-bundles over ˜M admitting a lift of the adjoint representation
of SU(2) are labeled by conjugacy classes of homomorphisms λ : U(1) →SU(2).
Clearly, with U(1) = {z ∈C : |z| = 1}, for every integer n, the mapping
λn(z) = diag(zn, z−n)

is a homomorphism. Since any unitary matrix is diagonalizable via conjugation by
unitary matrices, all other homomorphisms are conjugate to some λn. Thus, the
conjugacy classes of homomorphisms classifying the admissible principal SU(2)-
bundles are labeled by n ∈Z. The principal SU(2)-bundles admitting a lift of δ are
given by (1.9.24),
P ∼= K ×H

G ×CG(λn(H)) ˜P

,
where ˜P is necessarily trivial, that is, ˜P = R+ × CG(λn(H)). Thus, P can be naturally
identiﬁed as follows
P ∼= R+ × (K ×H G).
(1.9.49)
(b) Let us apply Corollary 1.9.15. By direct inspection, we see that the central-
izer CSU(2)(λn(U(1))) is U(1) for n ̸= 0 and SU(2) for n = 0. Consequently, ˜ω is
u(1)-valued for n ̸= 0 and su(2)-valued for n = 0. By (1.9.49), ˜ω may be globally
represented by a z-valued 1-form ˜A on R+. Let us analyze the mapping ˜Φ. Again by
(1.9.49), it is a function on R+ with values in the K-invariant connections on K ×H G,
cf. point 1 of Remark 1.9.14. The latter are given by (1.9.41). Since ˜Φ takes values
in L(m, su(2))U(1), where m is deﬁned by the orthogonal reductive decomposition
g = u(1) ⊕m, we must analyze the U(1)-invariance condition
˜Φ ◦Ad(h) = Ad(λn(h)) ◦˜Φ,
h ∈U(1).
Here we interpret
˜Φ as an intertwiner of the representations Ad(U(1))↾m and
Ad(λn(U(1))). For that purpose, it is convenient to pass to the complexiﬁcation
of the Lie algebras under consideration and to use the standard representation theory
of complex simple Lie algebras.22 Correspondingly, we extend ˜Φ by linearity to the
complexiﬁed spaces. Let h be a Cartan element and let e−, e+ be root vectors for
the complexiﬁcation of k = su(2). Clearly, u(1) is spanned by h and m is spanned
by the root vectors. By direct inspection, we see that m decomposes into irreducible
components of Ad(U(1))m as
m = Ce+ ⊕Ce−,
ad(h)↾Ce± = ±2 .
In physics notation, this is summarized in the formula
2 = (2) + (−2).
(1.9.50)
If we denote the Cartan element and the root vectors for g = su(2) by H, E−, E+,
respectively, then we have λ′
n(h) = nH. Consequently, the decomposition of g into
irreducible components reads, in physics notation,
3 = (0) + (2n) + (−2n).
(1.9.51)
22See [329, 344].

1.9 Invariant Connections
91
Comparing (1.9.50) with (1.9.51) we see that for n ̸= ±1, the decompositions do
not contain equivalent representations, that is, the intertwining operator ˜Φ vanishes.
In that case, the corresponding invariant connection on K ×H G is the canonical one
given by (1.9.43). Since λ′
n(h) = nH, for n = 0, this connection degenerates to a
'pure gauge'. For n = ±1, we get a nontrivial solution. For every r ∈R+, it is given
by
˜Φ(e−) = c−E−,
˜Φ(e+) = c+E+
c± ∈C.
(1.9.52)
Finally, returning to the original mapping ˜Φ by restricting the above intertwiner to the
real vector space m implies c+ = ¯c−. Thus, ˜Φ is labeled by two R-valued functions
on R+. The corresponding invariant connections are given by (1.9.41).

Example 1.9.18 (Translational invariance) Consider the orthogonal decomposition
of the Euclidean space
R4 = Re0 ⊕R3
and write pri, i = 1, 2, for the canonical projections onto the ﬁrst and the second
component. For x ∈R4, denote pr1(x) = x0 and pr2(x) = ˜x. In this notation, the
action of the Abelian group R by translations23 on the ﬁrst factor is given by
δ : R × R4 →R4,
δ(s, (x0, ˜x)) = (x0 + s, ˜x).
For a given Lie group G, let us classify the R-invariant connections over R4.
(a) Principal G-bundles π : P →R4 admitting a lift of δ are given by (1.9.24).
Here, K = R and H = {0}. Thus, λ0 must be the trivial homomorphism sending 0 to
1G. Consequently, CG(λ0(H)) = G and we obtain
P ∼= R × ˜P,
˜P = π−1(R3),
with ˜π : ˜P →R3 being a (trivial) principal G-bundle. Under this isomorphism,
the lift Δ of δ to automorphisms of P is given by translations on the ﬁrst factor,
Δ(s, (x0, ˜p)) = (x0 + s, ˜p).
(b) According to Corollary 1.9.15, R-invariant connections ω on P are given by
pairs ( ˜ω, ˜Φ), where ˜ω is a connection form on ˜P and ˜Φ is an equivariant mapping
from ˜P to L(Re0, g) ∼= (Re0)∗⊗g. Thus,
˜Φ(˜p) = ˜φ(˜p) ⊗e∗
0,
˜p ∈˜P,
where e∗
0 is the basis in (Re0)∗dual to e0 and ˜φ ∈HomG( ˜P, g). Given ( ˜ω, ˜Φ), let
us reconstruct ω: pulling back ˜φ and e∗
0 with the natural projections P →˜P and
23Although the group R is not compact, the action under consideration is proper and, since R is
Abelian, the standard scalar product is trivially Ad-invariant. As a consequence, the above theory
applies.

P →Re0, respectively, we obtain from ˜Φ a horizontal 1-form ˜τ of type Ad on P.
Extending ˜ω via the R-action to P, we obtain
ω = ˜ω + ˜τ.

Chapter 2
Linear Connections and Riemannian
Geometry
In Sects.2.1 and 2.2, we present the general theory of linear connections together
with the reduction theory of the underlying frame bundle to some Lie subgroup of the
general linear group. These reductions are usually referred to as H-structures.1 They
lead to a uniﬁed view on possible geometric structures manifolds may be endowed
with. Using this framework, we discuss almost complex, pseudo-Riemannian, con-
formal, almost Hermitean and almost symplectic structures including a discussion
of the corresponding compatible connections. Thus, from the perspective of H-
structures, Riemannian geometry is an important special example. In Sects.2.3 and
2.5, we continue to study H-structures by investigating torsion-free compatible con-
nections. We ask which holonomy groups may occur for such connections. This
fundamental question has been ﬁrst systematically studied by Berger. In this delicate
analysis, the central object to be studied is the curvature mapping of the connection
under consideration. In Sect.2.3, we study the class of connections which are not
locally symmetric with emphasis on the metric case, where the H-structure deﬁnes
a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. For that case, we formulate the classiﬁcation result
of Berger without giving a proof. We also comment on the classiﬁcation in the non-
metric case. In Sect.2.5, we study the case of locally symmetric connections. This
leads us to the theory of symmetric spaces. We present the basics of this theory in a
fairly consistent manner including a number of important classes of examples. Next,
in Sect.2.6, we extend our discussion of compatible connections to vector bundles
with emphasis on Hermitean bundles and holomorphic structures. In Sect.2.7, we
present the basics of Hodge Theory2 including a detailed study of Weitzenboeck-
type formulae. Finally, in Sect.2.8, we discuss properties of Riemannian manifolds
which are special in dimension four.

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
2.1
Linear Connections
Let M be an n-dimensional differentiable manifold and let L(M) be its bundle of
linear frames, cf. Example 1.1.14. Recall that a linear frame at m ∈M is an ordered
basis u = (u1, . . . , un) in Tm M and that π : L(M) →M , π(u) = m, is a principal
GL(n, R)-bundle. The free right action of GL(n, R) on L(M) is given by
L(M) × GL(n, R) →L(M) ,
(u, a) →ua .
(2.1.1)
Here, ua = (uiai 1, . . . , uiai n).
In the sequel, the basic representation of GL(n, R) given by matrix multiplication
of elements of Rn from the left will be denoted by σ 0
n . Thus, σ 0
n (a)x = ax.
Deﬁnition 2.1.1 A principal connection Γ on the frame bundle L(M) will be
referred to as a linear connection on M.3
Given a linear connection on M, it induces connections on all tensor bundles over
M. To see this, it is enough to show that all tensor bundles over M are vector bundles
associated with L(M). For the proof, take the basic representation σ 0
n of GL(n, R)
and the corresponding associated bundle E := L(M) ×GL(n,R) Rn. Deﬁne
ϕ : E →TM ,
ϕ([(u, x)]) := xiui ,
(2.1.2)
where xi are the components of x ∈Rn in the standard basis {ei} of Rn. It is easy to
show that ϕ is an isomorphism of vector bundles (Exercise 2.1.1). Thus,
TM ∼= L(M) ×GL(n,R) Rn .
(2.1.3)
Via the dual of the basic representation, this induces an isomorphism
T∗M ∼= L(M) ×GL(n,R) (Rn)∗
(2.1.4)
and, thus,
Tk
l M ∼= L(M) ×GL(n,R) Tk
l Rn .
(2.1.5)
Remark 2.1.2 Often, a frame u ∈L(M) will be viewed as an isomorphism
u : Rn →Tπ(u)M ,
u(x) := xiui .
By (2.1.2), we have
ϕ ◦ιu = u .
(2.1.6)
♦
3As in the general theory, Γ is a horizontal distribution on L(M). Below, it will become clear why
it is reasonable to speak of a connection on the base manifold M.

2.1 Linear Connections
95
Now we can start discussing the theory of linear connections. First, we exhibit a
structure which distinguishes frame bundles from general principal ﬁbre bundles.
Deﬁnition 2.1.3 The differential form θ ∈Ω1(L(M), Rn) deﬁned by
θ(X) := u−1(π′(X)) ,
X ∈TuL(M) ,
(2.1.7)
is called the canonical Rn-valued 1-form on L(M), or, the soldering form.
Proposition 2.1.4 The soldering form θ is a horizontal 1-form of type σ 0
n ,
Ψ ∗
a θ = a−1 ◦θ ,
a ∈GL(n, R) .
Proof By deﬁnition, θ is horizontal. Let u ∈L(M) and a ∈GL(n, R). If we view u
as a mapping Rn →Tπ(u)M, then to Ψa(u) there corresponds the mapping
u ◦a : Rn
a→Rn
u→Tπ(u)M .
Thus, for any X ∈TuL(M),
(Ψ ∗
a θ)u(X) = θΨa(u)(Ψ ′
a X)
= (Ψa(u))−1(π′ ◦Ψ ′
a(X))
= (u ◦a)−1(π′(X))
= a−1θu(X) .
■
Remark 2.1.5 By Proposition 1.2.12, via the isomorphism (2.1.2), to θ there corre-
sponds a unique 1-form ˆθ ∈Ω1(M, TM) given by
ˆθm(X) = u ◦θ(X∗) = u ◦u−1 ◦π′(X∗) = X ,
whereπ(u) = m, X ∈Tm M and X∗∈TuL(M)fulﬁllingπ′(X∗) = X.Thus, ˆθ(X) =
X. That is why ˆθ is usually called the tautological 1-form.
♦
Now, let Γ be a linear connection on M and let ω be its connection form on L(M).
Then, any x ∈Rn deﬁnes a Γ -horizontal vector ﬁeld B(x) on L(M) by assigning to
u ∈L(M) the unique Γ -horizontal lift of u(x) ∈Tπ(u)M to the point u .
Deﬁnition 2.1.6 The vector ﬁeld B(x) is called the horizontal standard vector ﬁeld
deﬁned by x ∈Rn.
Proposition 2.1.7 For any x ∈Rn, the horizontal standard vector ﬁeld fulﬁls
1. θ(B(x)) = x,
2. Ψa∗B(x) = B(a−1x), a ∈GL(n, R),
3. if x ̸= 0, then B(x) vanishes nowhere.

96
2
Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Proof 1. We calculate
θu(B(x)) = u−1(π′(B(x)u)) = u−1(u(x)) = x .
2. By Proposition 2.1.4 and point 1, we have
θ(Ψa∗B(x)) = Ψ ∗
a θ(B(x)) = a−1θ(B(x)) = a−1x ,
and, thus, π′(Ψa∗B(x)) = u(a−1x). Since Ψa∗B(x) is horizontal, the assertion fol-
lows from the uniqueness of the horizontal lift.
3. Clearly, B(x)u = 0 iff u(x) = 0 and, thus, iff x = 0, because u : Rn →
Tπ(u)M is a vector space isomorphism.
■
Remark 2.1.8 Let {ei} be the standard basis in Rn. Then, the horizontal standard
vector ﬁelds Bi = B(ei) span the horizontal distribution deﬁned by Γ . Moreover,
B(x) is uniquely determined by the conditions
θ(B(x)) = x ,
ω(B(x)) = 0 .
(2.1.8)
♦
Lemma 2.1.9 Let A∗be the Killing vector ﬁeld on L(M) generated by A ∈gl(n, R)
and let x ∈Rn. Then,
[A∗, B(x)] = B(Ax) .
(2.1.9)

Deﬁnition 2.1.10 Let Γ be a linear connection on M and let ω be its connection
form. The 2-form Θ ∈Ω2(L(M), Rn) deﬁned by
Θ := Dωθ
(2.1.10)
is called the torsion form of Γ .
Clearly, Θ is a horizontal 2-form of type σ 0
n . The Structure Equation (1.4.9) for the
curvature of a linear connection is supplemented by a structure equation involving
the torsion form.
Proposition 2.1.11 (Structure Equations) Let ω, Ω and Θ be, respectively, the
connection, curvature and torsion forms of a linear connection Γ on M. Then, for
any X, Y ∈TuL(M),

2.1 Linear Connections
97
dω(X, Y) = −[ω(X), ω(Y)] + Ω(X, Y) ,

dθ(X, Y) = −

ω(X)θ(Y) −ω(Y)θ(X)

+ Θ(X, Y) .
(2.1.12)
Proof Equation (2.1.11) coincides with the Structure Equation (1.4.9) of the general
theory. Since θ is a horizontal form, (2.1.12) follows immediately from formula
(1.4.1), with σ being the basic representation.
■
Remark 2.1.12 Using
ω ∧θ(X, Y) = ω(X)θ(Y) −ω(Y)θ(X) ,
the Structure Equations may be rewritten as follows:
dω = −ω ∧ω + Ω ,
dθ = −ω ∧θ + Θ .
(2.1.13)
If we decompose the above forms with respect to the standard bases {ei} in Rn and
{Ei j} in gl(n, R),
θ = θiei ,
Θ = Θiei ,
ω = ωi
j E j
i ,
Ω = Ωi
j E j
i ,
(2.1.14)
then we obtain the Structure Equations in the form
dωi
j = −ωi
k ∧ωk
j + Ωi
j ,
dθi = −ωi
j ∧θ j + Θi .
(2.1.15)
♦
The Bianchi identity for the curvature has a counterpart for the torsion.
Proposition 2.1.13 (Bianchi Identities) Let ω, Ω and Θ be, respectively, the con-
nection, curvature and torsion forms of a linear connection Γ on M. Then,
DωΩ = 0 ,
(2.1.16)
DωΘ = Ω ∧θ .
(2.1.17)
Proof Equation (2.1.16) coincides with the Bianchi Identity (1.4.10) of the general
theory. Equation (2.1.17) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 1.4.12, with
σ = σ 0
n .
■
Alternatively, (2.1.17) may be checked by direct inspection. It is obtained by differ-
entiating the ﬁrst of the two equations in (2.1.15) and by using both of these equations
thereafter (Exercise 2.1.5).
Remark 2.1.14
1. The 1-forms ω and θ may be combined to the joint object
ω + θ ∈Ω1(L(M), gl(n, R) ⊕Rn) .

98
2
Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Clearly, gl(n, R) ⊕Rn is the Lie algebra of the afﬁne group on Rn. Its com-
mutation relations are obtained by supplementing the commutation relations of
gl(n, R) by
[A, x] = −[x, A] = Ax ,
[x, y] = 0 ,
A ∈gl(n, R) , x, y ∈Rn .
Accordingly, we may pass from the bundle L(M) of linear frames to the bun-
dle A(M) of afﬁne frames. Clearly, ω + θ deﬁnes a connection form on A(M)
which is called the afﬁne connection form induced by ω. This explains why lin-
ear connection and afﬁne connection are often used as synonyms in the literature.
Obviously,
Dω+θ(ω + θ) = d(ω + θ) + 1
2[ω + θ, ω + θ] = Ω + Θ ,
that is, curvature and torsion constitute a joint object on A(M), namely the cur-
vature of ω + θ.
2. Let {ei} and {E j i} be the standard bases of Rn and gl(n, R), respectively. Let
Bi be the horizontal standard vector ﬁeld with respect to a chosen connection Γ
generated by ei and let E j i∗be the Killing vector ﬁeld generated by E j i. Since the
E j i∗span the vertical subspace Vu ⊂TuL(M), for every u ∈L(M), and since
the {Bi} span the (complementary) Γ -horizontal subspace Γu, these n2 + n vector
ﬁelds provide a global frame in the tangent bundle TL(M) which is, therefore,
trivial. One says that the manifold L(M) admits a global parallelism given by
the vector ﬁelds Bi, E j i ∗. Moreover, the vector ﬁelds Bi, E j i ∗are dual to the
1-forms θi, ωi j,
θk(Bi) = δk
i ,
θk(E j
i ∗) = 0 ,
ωk
l(Bi) = 0 ,
ωk
l(E j
i ∗) = δk
iδ j
l .
(2.1.18)
Thus, T∗L(M) is trivial, too, and the 1-forms θi, ωi j provide a global frame
of T∗L(M), or, in more abstract terms, the afﬁne connection ω + θ induces an
absolute parallelism on A(M). As a consequence, every horizontal k-form α on
L(M) may be expanded with respect to the 1-forms θi,
α = 1
k!αi1...ikθi1 ∧· · · ∧θik .

In particular,

(2.1.20)
♦
Since both Ω and Θ are horizontal 2-forms on L(M) of type Ad, respectively, they
uniquely correspond to 2-forms on M with values in certain associated vector bun-
dles. By Proposition 1.2.12 and by the isomorphism (2.1.3), to Θ ∈Ω2(L(M), Rn)

2.1 Linear Connections
99
there corresponds an element T ∈Ω2(M, TM) deﬁned by
Tm(X, Y) = u(Θu(X∗, Y ∗)) ,
(2.1.21)
where X, Y ∈Tm M , π(u) = m and X∗, Y ∗∈TuL(M) fulﬁlling π′(X∗) = X and
π′(Y ∗) = Y.4 By Remark 1.4.7, to Ω there corresponds a 2-form on M with values
in the adjoint bundle Ad(L(M)). Since the differential of the basic representation
σ 0
n identiﬁes gl(n, R) naturally with End(Rn), this 2-form may be identiﬁed with the
curvature endomorphism form R ∈Ω2(M, End(TM)),
Rm(X, Y) = u ◦Ωu(X∗, Y ∗) ◦u−1 ,
(2.1.22)
cf. (1.5.13). Since R takes values in End(TM), we may apply it to any tangent vector
Z ∈Tm M:
Rm(X, Y)Z = u

.
(2.1.23)
Deﬁnition 2.1.15 Let Γ be a linear connection on L(M) and let Θ and Ω be its
curvature and torsion forms. The 2-forms T and R deﬁned by (2.1.21) and (2.1.22)
are called the torsion tensor ﬁeld associated with Θ and the curvature tensor ﬁeld
associated with Ω, respectively.
Remark 2.1.16 Since, for any u ∈L(M), the assignment Rn →Γu , x →B(x), is
an isomorphism of vector spaces, we have an induced isomorphism
b(u) : 2Rn →2Γu ,
b(u)(x ∧y) = B(x)u ∧B(y)u .
Using this, we get yet another presentation of curvature and torsion, which will turn
out to be useful. We deﬁne mappings
R : L(M) →2(Rn)∗⊗gl(n, R) ,
T : L(M) →2(Rn)∗⊗Rn
by
R(u) := Ωu ◦b(u) ,
T (u) := Θu ◦b(u) .
(2.1.24)
In the sequel, R and T will be referred to as the curvature and the torsion mappings,
respectively.UsingthatΩ andΘ arehorizontalformsoftypeAd andσ 0

Next, we discuss the covariant derivative of tensor ﬁelds and apply the Koszul
calculus developed in Sect.1.5 to the case under consideration. By Deﬁnition 1.5.2,
the covariant derivative
∇ω = (dω)↾Ω0(M,E) : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E)
on an associated bundle E = P ×G F, induced from a connection form ω, is given
by
(∇ωΦ)m(X) = ιp ◦(Dω ˜Φ)p(X∗) ,
(2.1.28)
with π(p) = m and X∗∈Tp P fulﬁlling π′(X∗) = X. Applying this to a section Y
of T M ∼= L(M) ×GL(n,R) Rn, that is, to a vector ﬁeld on M, we read off
(∇ωY)m(X) = u ◦(Dω ˜Y)u(X∗) ,
π(u) = m ,
(2.1.29)
where ˜Y ∈HomGL(n,R)(L(M), Rn) is given by Y(m) = u ◦˜Y(u). According to
(1.5.10), we have an associated operator
∇ω
X : Γ ∞(TM) →Γ ∞(TM) ,
∇ω
XY := (∇ωY)(X) .
(2.1.30)
In the sequel, we assume that a connection has been chosen and, for simplicity, we
write ∇instead of ∇ω.
Remark 2.1.17
1. By (1.5.3), formula (2.1.29) may be rewritten as (∇XY)(m) = u(X∗
u( ˜Y)), where
X∗is the horizontal lift of X. Thus, using
θu(Y ∗) = u−1 ◦π′(Y ∗) = u−1Ym = ˜Yu ,
we obtain
(∇XY)(m) = u(X∗
u(θ(Y ∗))) .

n and q copies of its dual, cf. Exercise
2.1.2. If not otherwise stated, by ∇we mean the covariant derivative in TM.
♦
The proof of the following proposition is left to the reader (Exercise 2.1.3). It provides
an axiomatic characterization of the covariant derivative of a tensor ﬁeld.
Proposition 2.1.18 Let Γ be a linear connection on a manifold M and let ∇be its
covariant derivative in TM. Then, the covariant derivative
∇X : Γ ∞(Tr
s M) →Γ ∞(Tr
s M) ,
acting on tensor ﬁelds of type (r, s) is uniquely determined by the following proper-
ties.
1. ∇X f = X( f ) , for f ∈C∞(M).
2. ∇X is a derivation of the tensor algebra.
3. ∇X commutes with any contraction.
We express the curvature and torsion tensor ﬁelds in terms of the covariant derivative.
Proposition 2.1.19 Let ∇be the covariant derivative of a linear connection Γ on
M. Then, the curvature and the torsion tensor ﬁelds of Γ are given by
R(X, Y) = [∇X, ∇Y] −∇[X,Y] ,
(2.1.32)
T(X, Y) = ∇XY −∇Y X −[X, Y] .
(2.1.33)
Proof Formula (2.1.32) follows from Proposition 1.5.11 as a special case. To prove
formula (2.1.33), let X∗, Y ∗be the horizontal lifts of X and Y. Then, Θ(X∗, Y ∗) =
dθ(X∗, Y ∗). Using this, together with (2.1.31) and π′([X∗, Y ∗]) = [X, Y], we obtain
T(X, Y)(m) = u(Θu(X∗, Y ∗))
= u(X∗
u(θ(Y ∗)) −Y ∗
u (θ(X∗)) −θu([X∗, Y ∗]))
= (∇XY −∇Y X −[X, Y])(m) .
■
Finally, we carry over the concept of parallel transport and holonomy as devel-
oped in Sect.1.7 to the case of linear connections on M. In this way, for a given
connection, we obtain the operation of parallel transport along curves in M both for
the frame bundle L(M) and for any associated tensor bundle Tr
s M. Correspondingly,
we obtain holonomy groups in all associated tensor bundles. As in the general theory,
there is a deep relation between holonomy and curvature, provided by the Ambrose-
Singer Theorem 1.7.15. This has tremendous consequences for the structure theory
of (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds, see Sect.2.3.
Clearly, comparing with the general theory, the situation here is special in so
far as the parallel transport operators apply to geometric objects living on the base

manifold M. Related to this fact, there is a special class of curves which we discuss
next. Applying the theory to the tangent bundle, for any curve γ : I →M, we obtain
a unique parallel transport of tangent vectors along γ . In the sequel, let I ⊂R denote
an open interval containing 0. Let ˙γ be the tangent vector ﬁeld of γ . By Example
I/1.5.5, it is given by
˙γ (t) = γ ′
t
 d
dt ↾t

,
where
d
dt denotes the unit vector ﬁeld on I. Applying the notions developed in
Sect.1.7, a vector ﬁeld X on M is parallel (with respect to a connection Γ ) along a
curve γ if
∇γ
d
dt X = 0 .
(2.1.34)
Here, ∇γ is the covariant derivative along the mapping γ and X must be viewed as
a section of TM along γ .5 In particular, since ˙γ is certainly a section of TM along
γ , we may consider the equation
∇γ
d
dt ˙γ = 0
(2.1.35)
and we may ask whether it admits solutions.
Deﬁnition 2.1.20 Let Γ be a linear connection. A curve γ : I →M , t →γ (t) , is
called a geodesic with respect to Γ if it fulﬁls equation (2.1.35).
The following proposition is left as an exercise to the reader (Exercise 2.1.4).
Proposition 2.1.21 If a curve γ : I →M is a geodesic, then for any α, β ∈R the
curve t →γ (α · t + β) is a geodesic, too.
■
Proposition 2.1.22 Let Γ be a linear connection on M. Then, the projection under
π : L(M) →M of any integral curve of a horizontal standard vector ﬁeld is a
geodesic. Conversely, every geodesic is obtained in this way.
Proof Let x ∈Rn. By deﬁnition, B(x)u is the unique Γ -horizontal lift of u(x) ∈
Tπ(u)M to u ∈L(M). Let t →˜γ (t) be an integral curve of B(x). Deﬁne γ := π ◦˜γ .
Then, using the natural identiﬁcation (2.1.2) and omitting ϕ,
˙γ (t) = π′ ◦˙˜γ (t) = π′(B(x) ˜γ (t)) = ˜γ (t)(x) = ιx( ˜γ (t)) ,
where ˜γ (t) : Rn →Tγ (t)M as usual. Thus, by (1.7.13) and (1.3.4), we have
∇γ
d
dt ˙γ = ωE
ι′
x( ˙˜γ (t))

= 0 .
Conversely, let γ : I →M be a geodesic. Let u0 ∈L(M) be such that π(u0) = γ (0)
and let x := u−1
0 ( ˙γ (0)) ∈Rn. Let t →˜γ (t) be the horizontal lift of γ through u0.
5That is, more precisely, we should write X ◦γ instead of X.

2.1 Linear Connections
103
If x = 0, we are done. Thus, let x ̸= 0. Then, there exists a curve t →σ(t) in L(M)
such that ˙γ (t) = σ(t)(x) . Hence,
d
dt ˙γ (t) = ι′
x ˙σ(t) .
Since γ is a geodesic, that is,
d
dt ˙γ (t) ∈Γ TM ⊂T(TM), this formula implies that
t →σ(t) is horizontal in L(M). Since σ(0) = u0 and π ◦σ = γ , uniqueness of the
horizontal lift implies σ = ˜γ . Thus, ˙γ (t) = ˜γ (t)(x) and, since ˜γ is horizontal,
θ( ˙˜γ (t)) = ˜γ (t)−1(π′( ˙˜γ (t))) = ˜γ (t)−1( ˙γ (t)) = x .
Thus, t →˜γ (t) is an integral curve of B(x).
■
Corollary 2.1.23 Let Γ be a connection on M. For every m ∈M and every X ∈
Tm M, there exists a unique geodesic γ : I →M with initial conditions (m, X), that
is, γ (0) = m and ˙γ (0) = X.
■
We say that a linear connection Γ on M is complete if every geodesic of Γ may
be extended to I = R. Then, we have another corollary following immediately from
Proposition 2.1.22.
Corollary 2.1.24 A linear connection on M is complete iff every horizontal standard
vector ﬁeld on L(M) is complete.
■
If M is endowed with a complete linear connection Γ , we may deﬁne the following
mapping. For every m ∈M and every X ∈Tm M, we take the unique geodesic γ
with initial conditions (γ (0) = m, ˙γ (0) = X) and put
exp : TM →M ,
exp(X) := γ (1) .
(2.1.36)
This mapping is called the exponential mapping of Γ .
Remark 2.1.25 If Γ is not complete, then exp may still be deﬁned. In this case, one
deﬁnes exp on a neighbourhood of the zero section in TM. This way, one obtains
a smooth mapping which, for every m ∈M, yields a local diffeomorphism from
a neighbourhood of the origin in Tm M onto a neighbourhood Um of m in M, see
Fig.2.1. For details, we refer to Propositions 8.1 and 8.2 in Chap. III of [381].
♦
In the remainder of this section, we describe the above structures locally. Thus,
let
m →e(m) = (e1(m), . . . , en(m))
be a local section of L(M), that is, a local frame of TM, and let
m →ϑ(m) = (ϑi(m), . . . ϑn(m))
be its dual coframe. Recall that e(m)(ei) = ei(m) for the standard basis {ei} of Rn.

Lemma 2.1.26 For any local frame e,
e∗θ = ϑi ⊗ei .
(2.1.37)
Proof For any X ∈Tm M, we calculate
(e∗θ)m(X) = θe(m)(e′(X)) = (e(m))−1(π′ ◦e′(X)) = (e(m))−1(X) .
Thus, decomposing X = Xiei(m) and using e(m)(ei) = ei(m), we obtain
(e∗θ)m(X) = Xi(m)ei = ϑi
m(X)ei .
■
Thus, for the components of θ with respect to the decomposition (2.1.14),
e∗θi = ϑi .
(2.1.38)
Next, the local representative A = e∗ω of a linear connection Γ with connection
form ω is a 1-form on M with values in gl(n, R). Thus, it may be written as
A = A i
k Ek
i = Γ i
jk ϑ j ⊗Ek

(2.1.39)
The coefﬁcient functions Γ i jk are called the Christoffel symbols of Γ in the local
frame e.
Remark 2.1.27 Consider a change e →e′ of the local frame.6 Using (1.3.15), we
obtain the following induced transformation formula for the Christoffel symbols

6We emphasize the passive interpretation here, but formula (2.1.40) may also be interpreted actively.

2.1 Linear Connections

Let us calculate the local representatives of curvature and torsion. For that purpose,
we take the pullback of (2.1.20) under e,
e∗Ωi
j = 1

ϑk ∧ϑl ,
e∗Θi = 1

ϑ j ∧ϑk ,
(2.1.41)
and denote the local coefﬁcient functions as follows:
Ri
klj = e∗Ωi
klj ,
Ti
jk = e∗Θi
jk .
To calculate them, we use the Structure Equations in the form given by (2.1.15).
Taking the pullback of the ﬁrst equation yields
1
2Ri
klj ϑk ∧ϑl = dA i
j + A i
k ∧A k
j .
Inserting (2.1.39) into this equation, we obtain (Exercise 2.1.7)

jkl = e j(Γ i
kl) −ek(Γ i
jl) + Γ m
klΓ i
jm −Γ m

(2.1.42)
where the Ci jk are the structure functions of the local frame e deﬁned by
[e j, ek] = Ci
jkei .
(2.1.43)
In the same way, taking the pullback of the second equation in (2.1.15), we read off
Ti
jk = Γ i
jk −Γ i
kj −Ci
jk .
(2.1.44)
Next, by Proposition 1.5.3, the local version of the Koszul calculus is based upon
the following formula. For a local frame e, we have
∇e j = Γ k
i jϑi ⊗ek .
(2.1.45)
Correspondingly,
∇eie j = Γ k
i j ek .
(2.1.46)
Next, acting with ∇ei on the pairing ϑ j(ek) = δ j k and using that the covariant deriv-
ative is a derivation of the tensor algebra, we obtain
∇eiϑ j = −Γ j
ik ϑk .
(2.1.47)
Thus,
∇ϑ j = −Γ j
ik ϑi ⊗ϑk .
(2.1.48)
Now, decomposing an arbitrary tensor ﬁeld with respect to a local frame e and its
dual coframe ϑ and using (2.1.46) and (2.1.47), together with the properties of the
covariant derivative, one can derive a local formula for the covariant derivative of

106

any tensor ﬁeld, see Exercise 2.1.7. In particular, for a vector ﬁeld X and a 1-form α
we obtain
∇ei X =

ei(Xk) + Γ k
i j X j
ek ,
(2.1.49)
∇eiα =

ei(α j) −Γ k
i jαk

ϑ j .
(2.1.50)
Using (1.5.8), we get ∇X = ϑi ⊗∇ei X and ∇α = ϑi ⊗∇eiα. Clearly, the covariant
derivative of any tensor ﬁeld t may also be decomposed in this way,
∇t = ϑi ⊗∇eit ,
(2.1.51)
in accordance with the fact that ∇t ∈Ω1(M, Tk
l (M)).
Remark 2.1.28 By point 2 of Remark 1.2.15, it is clear that the local representatives
of Ω and R, as well as the local representatives of Θ and T, coincide. Thus,

(2.1.52)
This can also be checked by direct inspection, inserting (2.1.46) into (2.1.32) and
(2.1.33) and comparing with (2.1.42) and (2.1.44) (Exercise 2.1.8).
♦
Remark 2.1.29 (Holonomic frame) Let (U, κ) be a local chart of M and let xi be
the corresponding local coordinates. Then, {∂j} is a local frame of TM, called the
induced holonomic frame of TM and {dx j} is the dual coframe of T∗M. The name
holonomic refers to the fact that [∂i, ∂j] = 0, that is, the structure functions of a
holonomic frame vanish. In such a frame, the formulae (2.1.39), (2.1.42), (2.1.44)
and (2.1.45) take the following form:
A = Γ i

It remains to analyze Eqs. (2.1.34) and (2.1.35) in local coordinates. Then, γ is given
by t →xi(t) and, correspondingly, X = Xi∂i and ˙γ = ˙xi∂i. Using points 3 and 4

(2.1.58)
This is a system of ﬁrst order ordinary differential equations, which according to
standard theorems admits unique local solutions depending smoothly on the initial
values (t0, X(t0)). The solution t →X(t) provides the parallel transport
ˆγ Γ TM(t): Tγ (t0)M →Tγ (t)M .
(2.1.59)
Inserting Xi = ˙xi into (2.1.58), we obtain the local form of the geodesic equation:

(2.1.60)
This is a system of second order ordinary differential equations, which admits unique
local solutions depending smoothly on the initial conditions (t0, xi(t0), ˙xi(t0)).
Remark 2.1.30
1. Consider the exponential mapping of a linear connection Γ on M, cf. equation
(2.1.36) and Remark 2.1.25. Via the exponential mapping, any frame u : Rn →
Tm M at m ∈M provides a local chart on Tm M:
ϕ := exp ◦u : Rn →Um .
This is a local diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of 0 in Rn onto a neighbour-
hood Um ⊂M of m. Taking κ := ϕ−1 we obtain a local chart (U, κ) centered at
m which will be referred to as a local geodesic chart. The local coordinates xi
of that chart mapping will be called normal coordinates at m. In normal coordi-
nates, any geodesic takes the form xi(t) = ai · t. Thus, at m, we obviously have
Γ ki j + Γ k ji = 0. That is, for vanishing torsion, the Christoffel symbols vanish
at m (Exercise 2.1.9).
2. The parallel transport of a tangent vector along a closed curve yields a geometric
interpretation of curvature. Note that this is in accordance with the Ambrose-
Singer Theorem 1.7.15. We have (Exercise 2.1.9)
△Xi = −1

H-Structures and Compatible Connections
In the sequel, we will meet reductions of the frame bundle L(M) to various Lie
subgroups of GL(n, R). The following concept allows for a uniﬁed treatment of all
of them.

2.2
H-Structures and Compatible Connections
109
Deﬁnition 2.2.1 (H-structure) Let M be a smooth manifold.
1. A reduction P of the frame bundle L(M) to a Lie subgroup H ⊂GL(n, R) is
called an H-structure on M.
2. An H-structure P is called integrable if for every point m ∈M there exists a local
chart (U, κ) with local coordinates x j such that the induced holonomic frame {∂j}
is a local section of P. Such local coordinates are called admissible.
3. Let ϕ : M →M be a diffeomorphism. If ϕ′ : TM →TM leaves P invariant,
then ϕ is called an automorphism of the H-structure.
Clearly, the automorphisms of an H-structure form a group. By Corollary 1.6.5,
reductions of L(M) to a Lie subgroup H ⊂GL(n, R) are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with smooth sections of the associated bundle
L(M) ×GL(n,R) (GL(n, R)/H) ,
(2.2.1)
or, equivalently, with elements of HomGL(n,R)(L(M), GL(n, R)/H). Thus, the exis-
tence of an H-structure on a manifold M is a topological problem which can be
dealt with by applying methods of obstruction theory. In particular, if GL(n, R)/H
is contractible, then an H-structure certainly exists. Note that, geometrically, an
H-structure should be viewed as a bundle of distinguished frames on M.
Recall from Deﬁnition 1.6.11 the general notion of compatible connection.
Deﬁnition 2.2.2 A linear connection on M is called compatible with the H-structure
P if it is reducible to P.
Next, recall Proposition 1.6.10 characterizing the reducibility of connections on
principal bundles in terms of G-homomorphisms.
Proposition 2.2.3 Let P be an H-structure on M and let
˜Φ : L(M) →GL(n, R)/H
be the GL(n, R)-equivariant mapping deﬁning P. Assume that GL(n, R)/H embeds
into a GL(n, R)-module F. Then, a linear connection ω on L(M) is compatible with
the H-structure P iff ˜Φ is parallel with respect to ω, that is, iff
Dω ˜Φ = 0 .
Proof By the proof of Proposition 1.6.2, P =

u ∈L(M) : ˜Φ(u) = [1]

. Thus, the
restriction of Dω ˜Φ = 0 to P reads
σ ′(ω)[1] = 0 ,
which holds iff ω restricted to P takes values in the Lie algebra of H. This is
equivalent to being reducible to P.
■

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Clearly, for a given H-structure P we may restrict the soldering form θ of L(M)
to P and, thus, for any connection ω on P we have a torsion 2-form Θ on P deﬁned
by (2.1.10). One says that ω is torsion-free if Θ vanishes.
Proposition 2.2.4 If P is an integrable H-structure on M, then it admits a torsion-
free connection.
Proof Let π : P →M be the canonical projection. Let s be an integrable local
section of P over U ⊂M. Taking the tangent bundle of the graph of s and extending
itusingtheright H-actiontoadistributionon P,weobtainaconnectiononπ−1(U) ⊂
P. Then, integrability implies s∗dθ = 0 (Exercise 2.2.1) and, thus, vanishing of the
torsion. Next, we patch together these local connections to a connection on P using
a partition of unity. Since torsion is additive this yields the assertion.
■
Since any other connection ω′ on P differs from ω by a horizontal 1-form α on P
with values in the Lie algebra h of H,
Θ′ = Θ + α ∧θ .
By Remark 2.1.16, Θ and α may be identiﬁed with H-equivariant functions
T : P →2(Rn)∗⊗Rn ,
˜α : P →(Rn)∗⊗h ,
respectively. Since H ⊂GL(n, R), we have a natural inclusion
ιh : h →End(Rn) ∼= (Rn)∗⊗Rn .
Thus, under the above identiﬁcation, α ∧θ is a function on P with values in
2(Rn)∗⊗Rn. We claim that it coincides with the image of ˜α under the mapping
δ : (Rn)∗⊗h →2(Rn)∗⊗Rn ,
δ := (a ⊗idRn) ◦(id(Rn)∗⊗ιh) ,
(2.2.2)
where a : (Rn)∗⊗(Rn)∗→2(Rn)∗is the anti-symmetrization mapping. Indeed,
using ˜α(u)(x) = α

B(x)

, we calculate
(α ∧θ)u


˜α(u)(y)

As a result,
T ′ = T + δ(˜α) .

be the natural projection.7 Then, the mapping
τ : P →coker(δ) ,
τ(u) := pr(T (u)) ,
(2.2.4)
does not depend on the choice of the connection. This motivates the following deﬁ-
nition.
Deﬁnition 2.2.5 The mapping τ is called the intrinsic torsion of the H-structure P.
Moreover, P is called torsion-free if τ vanishes.
Clearly, τ yields the obstruction to the existence of a torsion-free connection on P.
Proposition 2.2.6 Let P be an H-structure. Then, the following hold.
1. If ω and ω′ are torsion-free connections on P and ω′ = ω + α, then ˜α(u) ∈ker δ
for every u ∈P. In particular, if ker(δ) = 0, then P admits at most one torsion-
free connection.
2. P has a torsion-free connection iff it is torsion-free.
Proof The ﬁrst assertion follows immediately from (2.2.3). For the second one, if P
has a torsion-free connection, then it is clearly torsion-free. We prove the converse:
let ω be a connection with (non-vanishing) torsion Θ. By assumption, τ = 0. Thus,
T (u) ∈im(δ) for every u ∈P. That is, there exists an equivariant mapping ˜α :
P →(Rn)∗⊗h such that T = δ(˜α). Let α be the unique horizontal 1-form on P
corresponding to ˜α. Then, ω′ = ω −α is a torsion-free connection.
■
In particular, as an immediate consequence, we obtain
Corollary 2.2.7 If δ is bijective, then P admits a unique torsion-free connection. ■
Next, let us discuss a number of relevant examples.
Example 2.2.8 (Orientation) We take H = GL+(n, R). Then, GL(n, R)/H ∼= Z2.
According to Example 1.6.6, a section of the associated bundle (2.2.1) exists iff the
manifold is orientable, that is, iff the ﬁrst Stiefel-Whitney class8 of M vanishes.
In this case, the H-structure consists of those frames which are compatible with a
chosen orientation. Note that this H-structure is integrable. Also note that automor-
phisms of this H-structure are exactly the orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms
of M.
♦
Example 2.2.9 (Volume form) We consider H = SL(n, R). The basic representation
of GL(n, R) on Rn induces the following GL(n, R)-action on n(Rn)∗:
GL(n, R) × n(Rn)∗→n(Rn)∗,
(a, v) →det(a) · v .
7The mapping δ and its cokernel have an interpretation in terms of Spencer cohomology of hwhich
we suppress here. For details, see e.g. [569].
8See Sect.4.2.

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Restricted to n(Rn)∗\ {0}, this action is transitive and has the common stabilizer
SL(n, R). Thus,
GL(n, R)/SL(n, R) ∼= n(Rn)∗\ {0} .
Via the natural isomorphism nT∗M ∼= L(M) ×GL(n,R)
n(Rn)∗, the sections of
the associated bundle (2.2.1) are in one-to-one correspondence with volume forms
on M. The SL(n, R)-structure corresponding to a given volume form v consists of
those frames u fulﬁlling
v = v0 ◦nu ,
where v0 is the canonical volume form on Rn. Since GL(n, R)/SL(n, R) is homo-
topy equivalent to GL(n, R)/GL+(n, R), M admits an SL(n, R)-structure iff M is
orientable. Moreover, it is easy to show that any SL(n, R)-structure is integrable
(Exercise 2.2.2). Finally, note that the automorphisms of this H-structure are the
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of M.

Example 2.2.10 (Almost complex structure)
Take H = GL(n, C) canonically
embedded in GL(2n, R) via
a + ib →

,
a, b ∈GL(n, R) ,
(2.2.5)
and consider the canonical complex structure on R2n given by
J0 =

.
(2.2.6)
Since End(R2n) ∼= (R2n)∗⊗R2n, the basic representation of GL(2n, R) induces a
GL(2n, R)-module structure on End(R2n) given by
GL(2n, R) × End(R2n) →End(R2n) ,
(g, A) →g−1Ag .
Since End(R2n) is the Lie algebra of GL(2n, R), this is merely the adjoint represen-
tation. Now, by Proposition I/7.1.2, the induced action of GL(2n, R) on the subset
of endomorphisms fulﬁlling A2 = −id is transitive and the stabilizer of J0 is
HJ0 =

(2.2.7)

complex manifold. Since End(R2n) ∼= (R2n)∗⊗R2n, J may be viewed as a tensor
ﬁeld on M of type (1, 1). The GL(n, C)-structure deﬁned by J will be denoted by
C(M, J) and will be referred to as the bundle of complex linear frames. Note that it
consists of frames fulﬁlling
u ◦J0 = Jm ◦u ,
(2.2.8)
where u : R2n →Tm M as usual. It is easy to show that every almost complex mani-
fold is orientable (Exercise 2.2.4). For a discussion of the obstructions to the existence
of almost complex structures we refer to [431].
Next, let us discuss integrability. By (2.2.8), an almost complex structure (M, J)
is integrable if M has the structure of a complex manifold such that for any system
of admissible local coordinates (x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn) we have
J
 ∂
∂xk

=
∂
∂yk ,
J
 ∂

= −∂
∂xk .
Then, zk := xk + iyk provide M with a local chart of complex coordinates. Con-
versely, we have
Proposition 2.2.11 Viewed as a real C∞-manifold, every complex manifold M car-
ries a natural induced integrable almost complex structure.
Proof Let {(Ui, κi)} be a holomorphic atlas of M consisting of charts κi : Ui →Cn.
For every i, we deﬁne an associated mapping ˜κi : Ui →R2n given by
˜κi(m) := (Re(κ1(m)), . . . , Re(κn(m)), Im(κ1(m)), . . . , Im(κn(m))) ,
which clearly provides a C∞-chart on Ui. Thus, {(Ui, ˜κi)} endows M with the
structure of a real C∞-manifold. Next, consider R2n with the global coordinates
x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . yn. Then,
J
 ∂
∂xk

:=
∂

J

:= −∂
∂xk ,
clearly deﬁnes a complex structure on R2n. We transport this complex structure to
M, viewed as a real manifold, via the local charts ˜κi. The almost complex structure
deﬁned in this way is independent of the choice of the atlas, because the transition
mappings are holomorphic and a mapping of an open subset of Cn to Cn leaves an
almost complex structure on Cn invariant iff it is holomorphic (Exercise 2.2.3). By
construction, the above almost complex structure is integrable. Indeed,
(x, y) →

To summarize, an almost complex structure is integrable iff it is induced from a
complex structure. The following notion provides a criterion for integrability.
Deﬁnition 2.2.12 Let (M, J) be an almost complex manifold. The Nijenhuis tensor
of (M, J) is the tensor ﬁeld N ∈Γ ∞(T1
2(M)) deﬁned by
N(X, Y) := [JX, JY] −[X, Y] −J([X, JY]) −J([JX, Y]) ,
X, Y ∈X(M) .
The following deep theorem holds, see [485].
Theorem 2.2.13 (Newlander-Nirenberg) An almost complex structure J is inte-
grable iff the Nijenhuis tensor of J vanishes.
■
Next, we show that J implies a natural splitting of tensor bundles over M. In par-
ticular, this will imply a variety of equivalent criteria for integrability. From now on,
let T = R2n denote the basic GL(2n, R)-module, let T∗be the dual (contragredient)
module and let TC and T∗
C be the complexiﬁcations of T and T∗, respectively. We
extend J0 to a C-linear mapping of TC and decompose TC into eigenspaces T1,0 and
T0,1 corresponding to the eigenvalues i and −i of J0:
TC = T1,0 ⊕T0,1 .
(2.2.9)
Then,
T1,0 = {X −iJ0X : X ∈T} ,
T0,1 = {X + iJ0X : X ∈T} .
(2.2.10)
On the other hand, recall from Sect.7.5 of Part I that J0 endows T with the structure
of a complex vector space, denoted by V , via
(a + ib)X := aX + bJ0X ,
a, b ∈R , X ∈T .
(2.2.11)
Clearly, V ∼= Cn carries the basic GL(n, C)-module structure. Let ι be the natural
embedding of V into TC. Via this mapping, a chosen basis (e1, . . . , en) in V induces
a basis (e1, J0e1, . . . , en, J0en) in TC. By (2.2.11), for Z = (Xk + iY k)ek we have
ι(Z) = Xkek + Y kJ0ek .
(2.2.12)
Note that ι is not complex linear. Next, let pr1,0 : TC →T1,0 and pr0,1 : TC →T0,1
be the canonical projections. Then,
pr1,0 ◦ι : V →T1,0 ,
pr0,1 ◦ι : V →T0,1
m ,
(2.2.13)
are C-linear and C-anti-linear vector space isomorphisms, respectively (Exercise
2.2.6). Next, recall the embedding GL(n, C) →GL(2n, R) given by (2.2.5). It
extends to TC by

One easily checks (Exercise 2.2.6) that for any Z ∈V ,
pr1,0 ◦ρ(g) ◦ι(Z) = (a + ib)Z ,
pr0,1 ◦ρ(g) ◦ι(Z) = (a −ib)Z .
(2.2.14)
Ontheotherhand,thesubspacesT1,0 andT0,1 areinvariantundertheGL(n, C)-action
and, by (2.2.5), they carry the basic representation of GL(n, C) and its conjugate,
respectively. It follows that V and T1,0 are isomorphic as GL(n, C)-modules.
Next, note that, by duality, the decomposition (2.2.9) implies a decomposition
T∗
C = T∗1,0 ⊕T∗0,1 ,
(2.2.15)
where T∗1,0 and T∗0,1 are the annihilators of T0,1 and T1,0, respectively. Thus, they
carry the dual of the basic and the basic representation of GL(n, C), respectively.
This decomposition induces the following decompositions:
kT∗
C =

p+q=k
p,q ,
p,q = p T∗1,0 ⊗q T∗0,1 .
(2.2.16)
Clearly, in analogy to (2.2.9) and (2.2.15), J induces decompositions
TCM = T1,0M ⊕T0,1M ,
T∗
CM = T∗1,0M ⊕T∗0,1M .
(2.2.17)
Note that, as a complex vector bundle, TM is C-linearly isomorphic to T1,0M via
(2.2.13). Corresponding to (2.2.16), we have
kT∗
CM =

p+q=k
p,q M ,
p,q M = p T∗1,0M ⊗q T∗0,1M .
(2.2.18)
The spaces of sections of kT∗CM and p,q M will be denoted by Ωk
C(M) and by
Ω p,q(M), respectively. Elements of Ω p,q(M) are called differential forms of type
(p, q). Let us denote the projection to Ω p,q(M) by Π p,q. Extending the exterior
differential C-linearly, we may deﬁne mappings ∂: Ω p,q(M) →Ω p+1,q(M) and
∂: Ω p,q(M) →Ω p,q+1(M) via
∂:= Π p+1,q ◦d ,
∂:= Π p,q+1 ◦d .
(2.2.19)
Proposition 2.2.14 For an almost complex manifold, the following conditions are
equivalent:
1. N(X, Y) = 0 for all X, Y ∈X(M).
2. T1,0M is involutive.

4. For any α ∈Ωk
C(M), we have dα = ∂α + ∂α.
Proof Recall that, as a real vector space, TC decomposes as TC = T + iT. Cor-
respondingly, we have real linear projections Re, Im : TC →T deﬁned by W =
Re(W) + iIm(W) for all W ∈TC. Now, for any X, Y ∈X(M), we calculate
N(X, Y) = [JX, JY] −[X, Y] −J([X, JY]) −J([JX, Y])

Since for elements W ∈T0,1 we have Im(W) = J(Re(W)), points 1 and 2 are equiv-
alent. For α ∈Ω1,0(M) and X, Y ∈Γ ∞(T1,0M),
dα(X, Y) = X(α(Y)) −Y(α(X)) −α([X, Y]) = −α([X, Y]) ,
where α ∈Ω0,1(M) deﬁned by α(W) = α(W) with W denoting the conjugation in
TC. This implies the equivalence of points 2 and 3. Clearly, point 4 implies point
3. Thus, it remains to prove the converse. We note that d = ∂+ ∂holds iff dα ∈
Ω p+1,q(M) ⊕Ω p,q+1(M) for any α ∈Ω p,q(M). Locally,
α = f ϑi1 ∧. . . ∧ϑi p ∧ϕ j1 ∧. . . ∧ϕ jq ,

Finally, we note that a diffeomorphism ϕ : M →M is an automorphism of an
almost complex structure J iff ϕ′ ◦J = J ◦ϕ′. If J is integrable, then this means that
ϕ is holomorphic.
♦
The following example is closely related to Example 1.6.6.
Example 2.2.16 (Pseudo-Riemannian metric) Denote the vector space of symmetric
covariant tensors of second rank on Rn by S2Rn. Endow Rn with a pseudo-Euclidean
metric η ∈S2Rn with signature (k,l) where n = k + l. The basic representation of
GL(n, R) induces a GL(n, R)-module structure on S2Rn given by
σ : GL(n, R) →Aut(S2Rn) ,
σ(a) := (a−1)T ⊗(a−1)T .
(2.2.21)
Asalreadynotedunderpoint2ofExample1.6.6,bytheSylvesterTheorem,GL(n, R)
acts transitively on the subspace S2
(k,l)Rn ⊂S2Rn consisting of elements with ﬁxed
signature, and the stabilizer of η is O(k,l), that is,
GL(n, R)/O(k,l) ∼= S2
(k,l)Rn .
Thus, by (2.2.1), O(k,l)-structures are in one-to-one correspondence with pseudo-
Riemannian metrics g on M and the O(k,l)-structure corresponding to g coincides
with the bundle O(M) of frames which are orthonormal with respect to g. If (M, g)
is oriented, then O(M) further reduces to a principal SO(k,l)-bundle, denoted by
O+(M). Note that GL(n, R)/O(n) is contractible. Thus, an O(n)-structure, that is,
a Riemannian metric, always exists. On the contrary, for an arbitrary signature,
O(k,l)-structures may not exist. E.g. the obstruction to the existence of a Lorentz-
structure11 on a 4-dimensional oriented manifold is given by the Euler class of the
tangent bundle. Thus, for a non-compact M, there is no obstruction. Below, we will
see that associated with a pseudo-Riemannian structure, there is a unique torsion-
free connection. Then, point 1 of Remark 1.4.7 implies that an O(k,l)-structure
is integrable iff the curvature of this connection vanishes. Equivalently, a pseudo-
Riemannian structure is integrable iff it is locally ﬂat, that is, if for every point of M
there exists a neighbourhood on which g is given by the Euclidean metric.
Clearly,adiffeomorphismϕ : M →M isanautomorphismofanO(k,l)-structure
iff ϕ is an isometry of the corresponding pseudo-Riemannian metric g, that is,
ϕ∗g = g. It can be shown, see Theorem 3.4 in Chap. VI of [381], that the group
of isometries carries a Lie group structure with respect to the compact-open topol-
ogy. This Lie group will be denoted by I (M).

Example 2.2.17 (Conformal structure) For n ≥3, consider the Lie subgroup
CO(n) :=

a ∈GL(n, R) : aTa = c1 , c ∈R , c > 0

.
Clearly, CO(n) = R+ × O(n). By the previous example, GL(n, R) acts transi-
tively on the space S2
(k,l)Rn. Thus, it also acts transitively on the set of conformal
11A pseudo-Riemannian structure with signature (+, −, −, −).

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
equivalence classes of elements of S2
(k,l)Rn deﬁned by the relation η ∼η′ iff η′ = cη
for some positive real number c. Clearly, the stabilizer of an element [η] is CO(n).
Thus, CO(n)-structures are in one-to-one correspondence with conformal equiva-
lence classes [g] of metrics on M, with the equivalence deﬁned as follows: two
metrics g1 and g2 are conformally equivalent iff they differ by a positive function.
The CO(n)-structure corresponding to class [g] is denoted by CO(M) and is referred
to as the bundle of conformal frames.
Since CO(n) = R+ × O(n), the representation theory of CO(n) is essentially
obtained as an extension of the representation theory of the orthogonal group O(n).
The irreducible representations of R+ on R are labeled by real numbers r ∈R and
are given by
R+ × R →R ,
(t, x) →trx .
The number r is called the conformal weight of the representation under considera-
tion. Let us denote the corresponding representation space by Lr (a copy of R). Then,
a typical CO-module is a tensor product of an O(n)-module with Lr. Note that, with
respect to the conformal structure [g], the tangent and the cotangent bundles can
no longer be identiﬁed, because they correspond to representations containing the
factors Lr and L−r, respectively. Clearly, on the level of vector bundles over M, the
additional factors Lr corresponds to building the tensor product with an associated
line bundle characterized by r.
In close relation to the previous example, one can show that a conformal structure
isintegrableiffitislocallyconformallyﬂat,thatis,iffforeverypointof M thereexists
a neighbourhood on which the metric is given by g = f 2g0, where g0 is the (ﬂat)
Euclidean metric and f is a nowhere vanishing function on that neighbourhood.
If this condition holds globally, then one says that (M, g) is conformally ﬂat or,
equivalently, that (M, [g]) is ﬂat.
A diffeomorphism ϕ : M →M is an automorphism of a CO(n)-structure iff there
exists a nowhere vanishing function f ∈C∞(M) such that ϕ∗g = f 2g, where g
is some representative of this structure. The automorphism group of a conformal
structure (M, [g]) is called the conformal group of (M, [g]). It will be denoted by
C(M, [g]). The following classical theorem may be found in [381].12
Theorem 2.2.18 Let (M, g) be a connected n-dimensional Riemannian manifold
with n ≥3. Then, its conformal group C(M, [g]) is a Lie group of dimension at most
1
2(n + 1)(n + 2).

Example 2.2.19 (Almost Hermitean structure) Recall from Example I/7.5.5 that, in
the standard embedding (2.2.6) of GL(n, C) →GL(2n, R), we have
U(n) = SO(2n) ∩GL(n, C) .
(2.2.22)
12The authors of [381] outline a proof based upon results of Eisenhardt [183] and Palais [499].

(2.2.23)
This shows that we may combine an almost complex structure C(M) with the
SO(2n)-structure O+(M) of a 2n-dimensional (oriented) Riemannian manifold by
intersecting them. On the algebraic level, JT
0ηJ0 = η. Thus, if we assume that J is an
isometry, that is,
g(JX, JY) = g(X, Y) ,
X, Y ∈X(M) ,
(2.2.24)
then the intersection
U(M) := C(M) ∩O+(M)
(2.2.25)
is a U(n)-structure.13 It is called the bundle of unitary frames. If (2.2.24) is fulﬁlled,
we say that g is a Hermitean metric with respect to J. The triple (M, g, J) is called an
almost Hermitean manifold. If, additionally, J is integrable, then (M, g, J) is called
a Hermitean manifold. Note that
β(X, Y) := g(X, JY)
(2.2.26)
is a non-degenerate 2-form on M. Thus, βn is a nowhere vanishing 2n-form,
that is, an orientation of M. This shows that every almost Hermitean manifold is
endowed with a canonical volume form. Existence and integrability criteria of almost
Hermitean structures are obtained from Examples 2.2.10 and 2.2.16 above. Clearly,
a diffeomorphism ϕ : M →M is an automorphism of a U(n)-structure iff it is an
automorphism of the GL(n, C)- and of the SO(2n)-structure.
We give an equivalent description of an almost Hermitean manifold (M, g, J).
Viewing its tangent bundle TM as a complex vector bundle, each of its ﬁbres carries
a Hermitean scalar product, given by14
h(X, Y) := g(X, Y) + ig(X, JY) .
(2.2.27)
Equivalently, by (2.2.26),
h(X, Y) = g(X, Y) + iβ(X, Y) = β(JX, Y) + iβ(X, Y) .
(2.2.28)
Note that h is linear in the ﬁrst and anti-linear in the second entry (Exercise 2.2.8).
Thus, (TM, h) is a Hermitean vector bundle, cf. Deﬁnition 1.1.16. As usual, let
˜h, ˜g and ˜J be the equivariant mappings corresponding to h, g and J, respectively.
13It sufﬁces to assume that C(M) and O+(M) have a nonempty intersection over every point of M.
14See Sect.7.5 of Part I. Note that we have changed conventions in order to be compatible with the
standard literature.

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Restricted to U(M), ˜g and ˜J coincide with the Euclidean metric η and the standard
complex structure J0, respectively. Let h0 be the Hermitean form deﬁned by η and
J0 via (2.2.27). Since η is SO(2n)-invariant and since J0 commutes with the U(n)-
action, h0 is U(n)-invariant. This yields the following.
Proposition 2.2.20 Relative to a given almost complex structure J on M, U(n)-
structures on M are in one-to-one correspondence with Hermitean ﬁbre metrics on
TM.15
■
Finally, we give a characterization of the above objects in terms of the decompositions
(2.2.9), (2.2.15) and (2.2.16). Here, T may be viewed as the basic SO(2n)-module
and, by (2.2.22), the subspaces T1,0 and T0,1 carry the basic representation of U(n)
and its conjugate, respectively. Thus, V and T1,0 are isomorphic as U(n)-modules.
For k = 2, the decomposition (2.2.16) takes the form
2T∗
C = 2,0 ⊕1,1 ⊕0,2 .
(2.2.29)
By standard representation theory, the adjoint representation of U(n) is given by the
tensor product of the basic representation and its dual. Thus, after intersecting with
the real exterior product 2T∗, formula (2.2.29) corresponds to the decomposition
o(2n) = u(n) ⊕u(n)⊥, where
u(n) = 1,1 ∩2T∗,
u(n)⊥=
2,0 ⊕0,2
∩2T∗.
(2.2.30)
For a given basis (e1, Je1, . . . , en, Jen) of T, let (ϑ1, ϕ1, . . . , ϑn, ϕn) be the dual
basis in T∗. Clearly, the latter yields the bases
{ϑk ∧ϑl} ,
{ϑk ∧ϕl} ,
{ϕk ∧ϕl} ,
k < l ,
k,l = 1, . . . n ,
in, respectively, 2,0, 1,1 and 0,2. In particular, for (e1, . . . , en) we may choose
the standard basis in V ∼= Cn. Since ˜h takes values in the space of bilinear forms on
TC, we obtain (Exercise 2.2.9)
˜h(u) =
n
	
k=1
(ϑk ⊗ϑk + ϕk ⊗ϕk) −i

for any u ∈U(M). From (2.2.28), we read off

k=1
(ϑk ⊗ϑk + ϕk ⊗ϕk) ,
˜β(u) = −
n
	
k=1
ϑk ∧ϕk .
(2.2.32)
To summarize, for u ∈U(M),
15Clearly, this is consistent with Example 1.1.18, where we considered the orthonormal frame
bundle of an arbitrary vector bundle carrying a ﬁbre metric.

Example 2.2.21 (Almost symplectic structure) Consider H = Sp(n, R). Recall that
this is the group of linear transformations of R2n leaving the standard symplectic form
(2.2.6) invariant.16 Thus, Sp(n, R)-structures are in one-to-one correspondence with
2-forms on M of maximal rank. Such structures are called almost symplectic. By
the previous example, each almost Hermitean structure deﬁnes such a 2-form β. By
Proposition I/7.5.3,
Sp(n, R) ∩GL(n, C) = U(n) = SO(2n) ∩Sp(n, R) ,
and, thus, each pair built from the triple (g, J, β) yields the same U(n)-structure.
Moreover, since Sp(n, R) and GL(n, C) contain U(n) as their maximal compact
subgroup, M admits an almost symplectic structure iff it admits an almost complex
structure. Clearly, by the Darboux Theorem I/8.1.5, an almost symplectic structure
is integrable iff dβ = 0. Then (M, β) is called a symplectic manifold. A Hermitean
manifold (M, g, J) such that the 2-form β deﬁned by (2.2.26) is closed is called
Kähler. For the discussion of existence, see Remark I/8.1.4.
Clearly, a diffeomorphism ϕ : M →M is an automorphism of an Sp(n, R)-
structure iff ϕ∗β = β. If (M, β) is symplectic, then ϕ is called a symplectomorphism.
For the study of the group of symplectomorphisms see Sect.8.8 in Part I.

ifolds are in one-to-one correspondence with O(k,l)-structures. Thus, let (M, g) be
a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and let O(M) be its O(k,l)-structure. In terms of
the corresponding equivariant mapping ˜g,
O(M) = {u ∈L(M): ˜g(u) = η} ,
(2.2.34)
where η is the standard inner product on Rn with signature (k,l). By Proposition
2.2.3, a linear connection ω on M is compatible with the O(k,l)-structure iff g is
parallel with respect to ω. A linear connection fulﬁlling this condition is called metric.
By (2.2.21), the metricity condition D˜g = d˜g + σ ′(ω)˜g = 0 reads
d˜g −

ωT ⊗1 + 1 ⊗ωT
(˜g) = 0 .
(2.2.35)
More explicitly, decomposing ω with respect to the basis {E j i} in gl(n, R) and ˜g
with respect to the basis in S2Rn induced from the standard basis of Rn, (2.2.35)
takes the form

d˜g jk −˜g jlωl
k −˜gklωl
j = 0 .
(2.2.36)
But, on O(M) we have ˜gkl = ηkl and, thus, d˜g jk = 0. This shows that ω is metric iff
its reduction to O(M) fulﬁls
ω jk + ωkj = 0 ,
that is, iff this reduction takes values in the Lie algebra o(k,l), indeed. Equivalently,
the metricity condition is given by ∇g = 0. Since ∇X is a derivation of the tensor
algebra, the latter is equivalent to
X(g(Y, Z)) = g(∇XY, Z) + g(Y, ∇X Z) ,
(2.2.37)
for any X, Y, Z ∈X(M).
Remark 2.2.23 Let (V, q) be a quadratic vector space over K. Assume that K is R
or C and that q is non-degenerate. Recall from Example I/5.2.6 that the Lie algebra
o(V, q) of the orthogonal group O(V, q) coincides with those endomorphisms of V
which are anti-symmetric with respect to the symmetric bilinear form η of q. In the
context of Clifford algebras, see Sect.5.2, we will see that the following canonical
isomorphism of Lie algebras holds:
κ : o(V, q) →2V ,
κ(A) = 1
4 A(ei) ∧η−1(ϑi) ,
(2.2.38)
where {ei} is a q-orthogonal basis in V and {ϑ j} is the dual basis. Denoting Akl =
g(ek, Ael), we obtain
κ(A) = 1
4ηi j A(ei) ∧e j = 1
4 Ai jei ∧e j .
(2.2.39)
♦
Proposition 2.2.24 Any O(k,l)-structure has a unique torsion-free connection.
Proof By Corollary 2.2.7, it is enough to show that the mapping δ given by (2.2.2) is
bijective. In the case under consideration, h = o(k,l) ∼=
2Rn ∼=
2(Rn)∗. Thus,
δ : (Rn)∗⊗2(Rn)∗→2(Rn)∗⊗Rn .
Let α ∈(Rn)∗⊗2(Rn)∗and let αi jk be the components of α in the basis induced
from the standard basis of Rn. Then, αi jk = −αikj and the components of δ(α) are
given by 1
2(αi jk −α jik). Assume δ(α) = 0. Then,
αi jk = α jik = −α jki = −αkji = αki j = αikj = −αi jk ,
that is ker(δ) = 0. Now, bijectivity follows from dimension counting.

2.2
H-Structures and Compatible Connections
123
A classical proof of Proposition 2.2.24 is obtained by using (2.2.37) and (2.1.33),
X(g(Y, Z)) = g(∇XY, Z) + g(Y, ∇X Z) ,
0 = ∇XY −∇Y X −[X, Y] .
Then, by direct inspection (Exercise 2.2.10),
2g(∇XY, Z) = X(g(Y, Z)) + Y(g(X, Z)) −Z(g(X, Y))
+ g([X, Y], Z) + g([Z, X], Y) + g([Z, Y], X) .
(2.2.40)
One easily checks that this equation deﬁnes a torsion-free connection. In the sequel,
the unique torsion-free connection deﬁned by g will be called the Levi-Civita con-
nection.
Finally, we derive local formulae for the Levi-Civita connection. In contrast to
general linear connections, here we have two natural types of local frames:
(a) local holonomic frames {∂j} induced from arbitrary local charts (U j, κ j),
(b) local frames {e j} which are orthonormal with respect to g.
Since the formulae (2.1.42), (2.1.44), (1.5.8) and (2.1.46)-(2.1.50) hold true for any
local frame, they clearly apply here. Let e be an arbitrary local frame. By (2.2.40),
2g(∇eie j, ek) = ei(g jk) + e j(gik) −ek(gi j) + Cl
i jglk + Cl
kiglj + Cl

where gi j = g(ei, e j). Thus,

For the case (a), we have gi j = g(∂i, ∂j) and Ci

have
Γki j = −Γ jik ,
Γ k
ik = 0 .
(2.2.44)
Using (2.1.46) and (2.2.43), we obtain

and, thus,
dϑi = −Γ i

(2.2.45)
Comparing with (2.1.46), we read off
dϑi = ϑ j ∧∇e jϑi .
(2.2.46)
This implies the following useful formula (Exercise2.2.11). For any α ∈Ωk(M),
dα = ϑ j ∧∇e jα .
(2.2.47)
Since the operator d is intrinsically deﬁned, this formula does not depend on the
choice of the frame. It can be rewritten as

Example 2.2.25 (Almost complex connection)
By Example 2.2.10, GL(n, C)-
structures on a manifold M are in one-to-one correspondence with sections J of
End(TM) fulﬁlling J2
m = −id for every m ∈M. By Proposition 2.2.3, a linear con-
nection ω on M is compatible with a GL(n, C)-structure iff J is parallel with respect
to ω. A linear connection fulﬁlling this condition is called almost complex. Recall
that the obstruction to integrability of an almost complex structure is given by the
Nijenhuis tensor N.
Proposition 2.2.26 Analmostcomplexmanifold(M, J)admitsatorsion-freealmost
complex linear connection iff J is integrable.
Proof We show that the intrinsic torsion vanishes iff J is integrable. Here, the map-
ping (2.2.2) takes the form
δ : (R2n)∗⊗gl(n, C) →2(R2n)∗⊗R2n .
We pass to the complexiﬁcations of both the domain and the target space of δ and
use the decompositions (2.2.9), (2.2.15) and (2.2.29), together with the embedding
(2.2.5). Then, the target space reads

(2.2.50)
The latter is obtained by a straightforward calculation, see Exercise 2.2.5. Thus, the
intrinsic torsion takes values in
coker(δ) =
0,2 ⊗T1,0
⊕
2,0 ⊗T0,1
.
We give the argument for the ﬁrst component. Let e = (e1, . . . , en) be a holomorphic
frame and let (ϑ1, . . . , ϑn) be the dual coframe. Taking the pullback under e of the
Structure Equation for the torsion, cf. (2.1.15), we obtain
Ti = dϑi + A i
j ∧ϑ j .
Evaluating the (1, 0)-component of this equation on X1, X2 ∈Γ ∞(T0,1M), we
obtain
Ti(X1, X2) = −ϑi([X1, X2]) .
We get the same equation for the (0, 1)-component evaluated on a pair of vector
ﬁelds of type (1, 0). Thus, the intrinsic torsion vanishes iff T1,0M and T0,1M are
involutive. Now, point 2 of Proposition 2.2.14 yields the assertion.
■
By the above proof and point 1 of Proposition 2.2.14, the Nijenhuis tensor measures
the torsion of an almost complex linear connection, see also Theorem 3.4 in Chap.
IX of [381] for a classical proof.
♦
Example 2.2.27 (Unitary connection) Here, we take up Example 2.2.19. Thus, let
U(M) be a U(n)-structure and let (M, g, J) be the corresponding 2n-dimensional
almost Hermitean manifold. Clearly, by Proposition 2.2.3, a linear connection ω on
M is compatible with the U(n)-structure iff both g and J are parallel with respect to
ω. Such a connection will be called unitary.
Assume that there exists a torsion-free unitary connection ω on M. Since U(M) =
C(M) ∩O+(M) and since the Levi-Civita connection of g is the unique torsion-free
connection on O+(M), ω is necessarily obtained as a reduction of the Levi-Civita
connection to U(M). Thus, if it exists, it is necessarily unique.
Proposition 2.2.28 Let U(M) be a U(n)-structure, let (M, g, J) be the correspond-
ing almost Hermitean manifold and let β be the almost symplectic form deﬁned

126

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
by the pair (g, J). Then, the Levi-Civita connection ω of g is compatible with the
U(n)-structure iff J is integrable and β is symplectic.
Proof Assume that ω is U(n)-compatible. Then, both g and J are ω-parallel and,
by Proposition 2.2.26, since ω is torsion-free and since J is parallel, J is integrable.
Moreover, the parallelity of g and J imply the parallelity of β. Then, (2.2.49) yields
dβ = 0. The converse statement follows immediately from the identity
2g((∇XJ)Y, Z) = dβ(X, JY, JZ) −dβ(X, Y, Z) + g(N(Y, Z), JX) ,
(2.2.51)
where ∇is the covariant derivative of ω and X, Y, Z ∈X(M), see Exer-
cise 2.2.12.
■
Thus, ω is compatible with the U(n)-structure iff (M, g, J) is Kähler. For a detailed
description of Kähler structures in terms of local coordinates we refer to Sects.4 and
5 of Chap. IX in [381].
Finally, by the discussion in Example 2.2.19, we obtain a characterization of
unitary connections in terms of the Hermitean ﬁbre metric h deﬁned by g and J.
Proposition 2.2.29 A linear connection ω on a Hermitean manifold (M, g, J) is
unitary iff the Hermitean ﬁbre metric h deﬁned by g and J is parallel with respect to
ω.
According to (2.2.33), ˜h(u) ∈1,1. Explicitly, the U(n)-module structure of 1,1
is given by

(2.2.52)
Thus, the metricity condition D ˜h = d˜h + σ ′(ω)˜h = 0 restricted to U(M) implies
ωT ⊗1 + 1 ⊗ωT = 0 .
(2.2.53)
Analyzing (2.2.53) in the standard basis as in Example 2.2.22, we obtain ω† + ω = 0,
that is, ω takes values in the Lie algebra u(n), indeed.

2.3
Curvature and Holonomy
In this section, we continue the discussion of connections compatible with H-
structures. Here, we consider exclusively torsion-free connections and ask which
holonomy groups may occur for such a connection. This question has ﬁrst been
studied systematically by Berger, see [68, 69].
At this point, the reader may wish to recall the basic notions from the general
holonomy theory as presented in Sect.1.7. For a linear connection Γ in L(M), let
Pu0(Γ ) be the holonomy bundle of Γ with base point u0 ∈L(M). By Proposition
1.7.12, Γ is reducible to Pu0(Γ ) and thus, for any u ∈Pu0(Γ ), the curvature Ω of Γ
takes values in the Lie algebra hu0(Γ ) of the holonomy group Hu0(Γ ) ⊂GL(n, R).
By the Ambrose-Singer Theorem 1.7.15, we have
hu0(Γ ) = span

Ωu(X, Y) : u ∈Pu0(Γ ) , X, Y ∈Γu

.
(2.3.1)
It is the condition of torsion-freeness which makes the above question nontrivial. If
we drop this assumption, then any closed Lie subgroup H ⊂GL(n, R) may occur
17Cf. also Example 2.2.19.

128

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
as the holonomy group of a linear connection on some n-dimensional manifold M,
see [283]. However, in general, such a connection will have a nontrivial torsion. By
the Bianchi identity (2.1.17), vanishing of the torsion implies
Ω ∧θ = 0 ,
(2.3.2)
and, by the Ambrose-Singer Theorem, this yields a nontrivial restriction on the
holonomy. Now, let P ⊂L(M) be an H-structure on an n-dimensional manifold
M, let ω be an H-compatible connection and let Ω be its curvature. For simplicity,
let us denote Rn ≡V . By Remark 2.1.16, we may represent Ω equivalently by the
curvature mapping

(2.3.4)
Since the exterior products of the components θi of θ span the spaces of horizontal
forms, (2.3.2) implies that R takes values in the kernel K(h) of the mapping
δ : 2V ∗⊗h →3V ∗⊗V ,
δ = (a ⊗id) ◦(id ⊗ιh) ,
(2.3.5)
where a is the anti-symmetrization mapping, cf. (2.2.2). Clearly,
K(h) =

F ∈2V ∗⊗h : F(x, y)z + F(y, z)x + F(z, x)y = 0 , x, y, z ∈V

.
The space K(h) is called the space of curvature mappings.
Lemma 2.3.1 The subspace
h := span {F(x, y) ∈h : F ∈K(h) , x, y ∈V }
(2.3.6)
is an ideal of h.
Proof Let F(x, y) ∈h and let A ∈h ⊂End(V ). Then, we may write
[F(x, y), A] = ˜F(x, y) −F(Ax, y) −F(x, Ay) ,
where
˜F(x, y) = [F(x, y), A] + F(Ax, y) + F(x, Ay) .
One checks by direct inspection that ˜F ∈K(h).
■

2.3 Curvature and Holonomy
129
Note that ˜F corresponds exactly to the action of A on F obtained by differentiating
the equivariance condition (2.1.25).18 Thus, by the Ambrose-Singer Theorem, for
the Lie algebra hu0(Γ ) of the holonomy group of a torsion-free connection Γ , we
have
hu0(Γ ) = hu0(Γ ) .
We conclude that a Lie subalgebra h ⊂gl(n, R) can occur as the Lie algebra of the
holonomy group of a torsion-free connection only if it coincides with the ideal h. This
is commonly referred to as the ﬁrst criterion of Berger. It yields a necessary condition
for a Lie subalgebra to be the holonomy Lie algebra of a torsion-free connection.
Next, let us analyze the Bianchi identity (2.1.16) in terms of R. The covariant
derivative DR = dR + σ ′(ω)R is a horizontal 1-form on P with values in K(h).
Deﬁnition 2.3.2 A torsion-free connection fulﬁlling DR = 0 is called locally sym-
metric.
Decomposing DR with respect to the horizontal frame {θi}, we obtain a function
DR : P →V ∗⊗K(h). Using the fact that the commutators of horizontal standard
vector ﬁelds corresponding to a torsion-free connection are vertical (Exercise 2.3.1),
we calculate
DΩ(B(x), B(y), B(z)) = dΩ(B(x), B(y), B(z))
= B(x)

Ω(B(y), B(z)

−Ω([B(x), B(y)], B(z)) + cycl.
= dR(B(x))(y ∧z) + cycl.
= DR(x)(y ∧z) + cycl. .
Thus, by the Bianchi identity DΩ = 0, we conclude that the function DR takes
values in the kernel of the mapping
δ′ : V ∗⊗K(h) →3V ∗⊗h ,
(2.3.7)
deﬁned as the composition
V ∗⊗K(h) →V ∗⊗2V ∗⊗h →3V ∗⊗h
of the inclusion and the anti-symmetrization mappings. Clearly, the kernel of δ′ is
K1(h) :=

Φ ∈V ∗⊗K(h) : Φ(x)(y, z) + Φ(y)(z, x) + Φ(z)(x, y) = 0 , x, y, z ∈V

.
Thus, if h is the holonomy Lie algebra of a torsion-free linear connection that is
not locally symmetric, then necessarily K1(h) ̸= 0. This is usually referred to as the
second Berger criterion.
18Clearly, this is the action of the Killing vector ﬁeld generated by A.

130

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Deﬁnition 2.3.3 A Lie subalgebra h ⊂End(V ) is called a Berger algebra if h = h.
A Berger algebra is called symmetric if K1(h) = 0 and non-symmetric otherwise.
Correspondingly, a Lie subgroup H ⊂Aut(V ) is referred to as a (symmetric or non-
symmetric) Berger group if its Lie algebra is a (symmetric or non-symmetric) Berger
algebra.
By the above discussion, we have the following.
Proposition 2.3.4 (Berger) Let h ⊂End(V ) be a Lie subalgebra. Then,
1. If h is the Lie algebra of the holonomy group of a torsion-free connection on some
manifold, then h is a Berger algebra.
2. If K1(h) = 0, then any torsion-free connection on a manifold whose holonomy
Lie algebra is contained in h must be locally symmetric.
Based upon these criteria, Berger started to tackle the above classiﬁcation problem.
It is natural to distinguish between the following two classes:
(a) Lie subalgebras h lying in some o(η), where η is some non-degenerate bilinear
form on V . In this case, the associated H-structure deﬁnes a pseudo-Riemannian
manifold. Therefore, this is called the metric case.
(b) Lie subalgebras which are not contained in any orthogonal Lie algebra. This is
called the non-metric case.
Within this general analysis, Berger obtained a list of candidates for Lie subalgebras
of type (a) and also an (incomplete) list for type (b).19 These lists where reﬁned and
completed by the work of Alekseevski [14], Bryant [108, 109], Chi [132], Merkulov
and Schwachhöfer [569]. The ﬁnal full classiﬁcation of irreducible holonomies
of torsion-free afﬁne connections was obtained by Merkulov and Schwachhöfer
[441]. For an exhaustive discussion, we refer to the reviews of Bryant [110] and
Schwachhöfer [570] and to the textbooks of Besse [76], Joyce [353] and Salamon
[555]. In [110], the reader can ﬁnd the complete classiﬁcation list (divided into four
parts) together with a lot of information on methods for proving that a given group
in the list really occurs as a holonomy. It turns out that every such group is realized
at least locally.20
In the remainder of this section, we exclusively consider the metric case. That
is, we consider (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds (M, g), endowed with their unique
torsion-free metric connection (the Levi-Civita connection). Under this assumption,
the frame bundle reduces to the orthonormal frame bundle O(M) and the whole
theory may be described in terms of objects living on O(M). Consequently, in the
case under consideration, the holonomy group is a subgroup of the structure group
O(k,l). If the Levi-Civita connection is locally symmetric, we call (M, g) locally
symmetric.
19The list provided by Theorem 2.3.19 below is included in type (a).
20The appropriate method working for three of the above mentioned four tables is to describe
torsion-free connections with a given holonomy as solutions to an exterior differential system and
to apply Cartan's existence theorem.

2.3 Curvature and Holonomy
131
Deﬁnition 2.3.5 Let (M, g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The curvature map-
ping
R : O(M) →2V ∗⊗o(k,l)
of the Levi-Civita connection of g is called the Riemann curvature mapping. Corre-
spondingly, the curvature tensor R is called the Riemann curvature of (M, g).
Comparing with the general case, R has some additional properties coming from the
fact that we may use the metric η to identify V with V ∗. In particular, o(k,l) ∼=
2V ∗,
and thus
R(u) ∈2V ∗⊗2V ∗,
(2.3.8)
for every u ∈O(M).
Proposition 2.3.6 The Riemann curvature mapping R of a pseudo-Riemannian
manifold has the following algebraic properties. For any x, y, z, w ∈V ,
R(x, y) = −R(y, x) ,
(2.3.9)
η(R(x, y)z, w) = −η(R(x, y)w, z) ,
(2.3.10)
η(R(x, y)z, w) = η(R(z, w)x, y) ,
(2.3.11)
R(x, y)z + R(y, z)x + R(z, x)y = 0 .
(2.3.12)
Proof Formulae (2.3.9) and (2.3.10) follow immediately from (2.3.8) and formula
(2.3.12) is a direct consequence of the fact that R takes values in the kernel K(h) of
the mapping (2.3.5). It remains to prove (2.3.11). For that purpose, we write down
the following four versions of (2.3.12).
0 = η(R(x, y)z, w) + η(R(y, z)x, w) + η(R(z, x)y, w) ,
0 = η(R(y, z)w, x) + η(R(z, w)y, x) + η(R(w, y)z, x) ,
0 = −η(R(z, w)x, y) −η(R(w, x)z, y) −η(R(x, z)w, y) ,
0 = −η(R(w, x)y, z) −η(R(x, y)w, z) −η(R(y, w)x, z) .
Summation of these equations and using (2.3.9) and (2.3.10) yields the
assertion.

(2.3.13)

for a ∈O(k,l) and x, y, u, v ∈V .
2. By (2.1.27), the Riemann curvature R fulﬁls identities corresponding to (2.3.9)-
(2.3.12) with x, y, z, w ∈V replaced by X, Y, Z, W ∈Tm M and η replaced by g.
Thus, in particular, R ∈Γ ∞

. For a local frame {ei}, using (2.1.52)
we write
Ri jkl ≡g(R(ei, e j)ek, el) = Rm
i jk gml .
In this notation, the algebraic properties (2.3.9)-(2.3.12) read
Ri jkl = −R jikl ,
Ri jkl = −Ri jlk ,
Ri jkl = Rkli j ,
(2.3.15)
Ri jkl + R jkil + Rki jl = 0
(2.3.16)
♦
Using the above properties, the space of Riemann curvature mappings K(o(k,l))
may be characterized as follows. By standard representation theory of the group
O(k,l), for n ≥4, one obtains the following decompositions into O(k,l)-irreducible
modules [76, 555]:
3V ∗⊗V ∗= 2V ∗⊕4V ∗⊕U ,
(2.3.17)
S2 2V ∗
= R ⊕Σ2
0 ⊕4V ∗⊕W ,
(2.3.18)
where Σ2
0 stands for the space of traceless endomorphisms of Rn (viewed as sym-
metric 2-tensors) and where U and W are orthogonal complements. By dimension
counting, U and W are not isomorphic.
Proposition 2.3.8 The space of Riemann curvature mappings is given by
K(o(k,l)) = ker ϕ ∩S2 2V ∗
,
(2.3.19)
where
ϕ : 2V ∗⊗2V ∗→4V ∗,
ϕ(ξ ⊗τ) := ξ ∧τ .
(2.3.20)
Proof Under the identiﬁcations o(k,l) ∼=
2V ∗and V ∼= V ∗, K(o(k,l)) coincides
with the kernel of the mapping χ : 2V ∗⊗2V ∗→3V ∗⊗V ∗given by
χ(α ⊗(ζ ∧τ)) := (α ∧ζ) ⊗τ −(α ∧τ) ⊗ζ .
Now, consider the decompositions (2.3.17) and (2.3.18). Viewing χ as an O(k,l)-
intertwining mapping and using Schur's Lemma, together with the fact that χ is
surjective, we conclude that χ must be zero on the irreducible subspaces R, Σ2
0
and W. By dimension counting, these subspaces span the kernel of χ. Moreover,
restricted to S2(2V ∗), χ maps onto 4V ∗and coincides with ϕ.
■

2.3 Curvature and Holonomy
133
Combining (2.3.19) and (2.3.18), for n ≥4, we obtain21
K(o(k,l)) = R ⊕Σ2
0 ⊕W .
(2.3.21)
This yields a decomposition of the Riemann curvature into its irreducible compo-
nents with respect to the action of O(k,l). The component Σ2
0 corresponds to the
contraction to V ∗⊗V ∗deﬁned by taking the trace of the mapping z →R(z, x)y
and restricting it to S2(V ∗).
Deﬁnition 2.3.9 (Ricci tensor) Let (M, g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and
let R be its Riemann curvature mapping. The mapping

Ric : O(M) →S2(V ∗) ,

Ric(u)(x, y) := tr {z →R(u)(z, x)y}
(2.3.22)
is called the Ricci curvature mapping. Correspondingly,
Ric : Tm M × Tm M →R ,
Ric(X, Y) := tr {Z →R(Z, X)Y}
(2.3.23)
is called the Ricci tensor of (M, g).
Note that Ric is of the same geometric type as the metric. Thus, viewing it as a
mappingTm M →T∗
m M andusing g−1 : T∗
m M →Tm M,wecandeﬁneascalaron M.
Deﬁnition 2.3.10 (Scalar curvature) Let (M, g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold
and let Ric be its Ricci tensor. The function
Sc : M →R ,
Sc(m) := tr(g−1 ◦Ric)(m)
(2.3.24)
is called the scalar curvature of (M, g). The corresponding equivariant function

Sc : O(M) →R is called the scalar curvature mapping.
The scalar curvature corresponds to the ﬁrst component in the decomposition
(2.3.21). The component corresponding to the third summand is called the Weyl
tensor. In Sect.2.8, the above decomposition will be discussed in detail for the case
n = 4.
Remark 2.3.11 Denoting Ri j = Ric(ei, e j) , we obtain the following local expres-
sions for the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature,
Ri j = gkl Rki jl ,
Sc = gi jRi j .
(2.3.25)
In particular, for a holonomic frame, we obtain
Ri j = ∂i Γ l
jl −∂j Γ l
il + Γ l
jmΓ m
il −Γ l
imΓ m
jl .
(2.3.26)
21For k + l = 3, one obtains K(o(k,l)) = R ⊕Σ2
0 . For k + l = 4, this result belongs to Singer and
Thorpe [592].

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
For an orthonormal local frame, we have Ri j = ηkl Rki jl. This yields the following
useful formula
Ric(X, Y) = ηklg(R(ek, X)Y, el) ,
X, Y ∈X(M) .
(2.3.27)
♦
There is an important special class of Riemannian manifolds characterized by the
fact that their curvature has a trivial Σ2
0-component in the decomposition (2.3.21).
Deﬁnition 2.3.12 (Einstein manifold) A (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold (M, g) is
called Einstein if its Ricci tensor is a constant multiple of the metric at each point of
M.
Note that for an n-dimensional Einstein space (M, g) we have
Ric = Sc
n g ,
(2.3.28)
where Sc is constant. In Sect.2.5, we will see a large class of Einstein manifolds.
In the next step, we show which impact the above additional structures have on
the analysis of the Berger criteria in the metric case. For a chosen orthonormal frame
u0 ∈Pu0(Γ ), let us consider the holonomy bundle Pu0(Γ ) ⊂O(M). Let us denote
H = Hu0(Γ ) ,
h = hu0(Γ ) .
On Pu0(Γ ), the curvature takes values in h ⊂o(k,l) ∼=
2(V ∗). This fact, together
with (2.3.19), implies the following.
Proposition 2.3.13 For any point u ∈Pu0(Γ ), the Riemann curvature R(u) belongs
to the space
K(h) = ker ϕ ∩S2(h) .
(2.3.29)
■
It turns out that for many subgroups H ⊂O(k,l), the restriction of ϕ to S2(h) is
injective. This implies K(h) = 0 and, thus, h = 0. Then, the ﬁrst Berger criterion
implies that, in this case, H cannot occur as a holonomy group.
In the same way, the covariant derivative DR may be dealt with. By the above
discussion, we have the following.
Proposition 2.3.14 For any point u ∈Pu0(Γ ), the covariant derivative of R(u)
takes values in
K1(h) = ker δ′ ∩

V ∗⊗K(h)

,
(2.3.30)
where δ′ : V ∗⊗K1(o(k,l)) →3V ∗× o(k,l), cf. formula (2.3.7).
■

2.3 Curvature and Holonomy
135
As already mentioned above, the condition K1(h) = 0 distinguishes a special class
of possible candidates. By Proposition 2.3.4, in this case the Riemannian manifold is
necessarily locally symmetric. We exclude this class of spaces for a while, postponing
its presentation to Sect.2.5.
Finally, we show that we may limit our attention to the case where the repre-
sentation of the holonomy group H on V ≡Rn is irreducible. We consider the
Riemannian metric case and comment on the pseudo-Riemannian case at the end.
Under this assumption, the holonomy group is a subgroup of O(n). Let us assume,
on the contrary, that the representation of H is reducible, that is, there exists a proper
subspace W ⊂V invariant under H. Since we assume that η be deﬁnite, there exists
an invariant orthogonal complement W ⊥⊂V . Proceeding further in this manner,
we obtain an invariant orthogonal decomposition
V = W0 ⊕W1 ⊕. . . ⊕Wk ,
(2.3.31)
with W0 carrying the trivial representation22 (acting as the identity) and Wk carry-
ing nontrivial irreducible representations of H for all k ≥1. The following theorem
belongs to de Rham [150]. It simpliﬁes the holonomy classiﬁcation problem essen-
tially.
Theorem 2.3.15 (de Rham Splitting Theorem) Let (M, g) be a Riemannian man-
ifold. If the holonomy group H acts reducibly on Rn, then the restricted holonomy
group23 H 0 of (M, g) is isomorphic to a product,
H 0 = {e} × H1 × . . . × Hk ,
and M is locally isomorphic to a product of Riemannian manifolds,
M0 × M1 × . . . × Mk ,
with M0 being ﬂat.
Proof By the above discussion, R : O(M) →2V ∗⊗o(n) and R(u)(x, y) takes
values in h ≡hu0(Γ ), for any u ∈Pu0(Γ ) and any x, y ∈V . Since the decomposition
(2.3.31) is invariant, we have
R(u)(x, y)↾W0 = 0 ,
R(u)(x, y)↾Wi ⊂Wi ,
(2.3.32)
for 1 ≤i ≤k. We decompose x =  xi and y =  yi with respect to (2.3.31) and
insert this decomposition into R(u)(x, y). This yields
R(u)(x, y) =
	
i
R(u)(xi, yi) +
	
i̸= j
R(u)(xi, y j) .
22Clearly, W0 may be zero.
23By Theorem 1.7.9, this is the identity connected component of H.

136
2
Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
By (2.3.12) and (2.3.32), we have R(u)(Wi, W j)Wk = 0 for i, j and k pairwise
distinct. Next, consider the case i = j ̸= k. Then, again by (2.3.12),
R(u)(xi, yi)zk = 0 ,
R(u)(yi, zk)xi = −R(u)(zk, xi)yi .
The ﬁrst of these equations implies R(u)(Wi, Wi)Wk = 0 for i ̸= k. Using (2.3.11),
from the second equation we obtain
η

R(u)(zk, xi)yi, xi

= η

R(u)(zk, yi)xi, xi

= η

R(u)(xi, xi)zk, yi

,
and the anti-symmetry of R implies R(u)(Wk, Wi)Wi = 0 for i ̸= k. We conclude
R(u)(x, y) =
	
i
R(u)(xi, yi) .
Now, according to the equivariance of R, as u ranges over π−1(m) ∩Pu0(Γ ) and
x, y over V , for every i, the mappings R(u)(xi, yi) span an ideal hi(m) ⊂End(Wi)
of h. Finally, varying m yields ideals hi and, by (2.3.1), the decomposition
h = h1 ⊕. . . ⊕hk .
This proves the ﬁrst assertion. To prove the second assertion, ﬁrst note that the
splitting (2.3.31) induces a splitting of the horizontal distribution Γ on Pu0(Γ ),
Γ = Γ1 ⊕. . . ⊕Γk ,
Γi := Γ ∩θ−1(Wi) .
By H-equivariance, this splitting induces a family of distributions Di = π′(Γi) on
M such that
TM = D1 ⊕. . . ⊕Dk .
Moreover, corresponding to (2.3.31), let us decompose
θ = θ1 + . . . + θk ,
ω = ω1 + . . . + ωk ,
Ω = Ω1 + . . . + Ωk ,
with θi ∈Ω1(Pu0(Γ )) ⊗Wi and ωi , Ωi ∈Ω∗(Pu0(Γ )) ⊗hi. We deﬁne the distri-
butions
ˆΓi := Γi ⊕Vi
on Pu0(Γ ), with Vi being the vertical distribution spanned by the Killing vector ﬁelds
generatedfromelementsofhi.Clearly,Γi isspannedbythehorizontalstandardvector
ﬁelds generated by any basis of Wi. Thus, ˆΓi annihilates both θ j, ω j, and Ω j for any
j ̸= i and, by point 2 of Remark 2.1.14 and (1.4.5), for every i the distribution ˆΓi is
involutive. Consequently, by the Frobenius Theorem, it is integrable and, for every
i, we have

2.3 Curvature and Holonomy
137
dθi + ωi ∧θi = 0 ,
Ωi = dωi + 1
2[ωi, ωi] .
(2.3.33)
Let Pi ⊂Pu0(Γ ) be an integral manifold of ˆΓi. Integrability of ˆΓi clearly induces
integrability of Di and the integral manifolds Ui of Di fulﬁl Ui = π(Pi) ⊂M. More-
over, for every i, the restriction πi : Pi →Ui of π deﬁnes a principal Hi-bundle and,
by (2.3.33), ωi is a torsion-free connection on Pi with restricted holonomy group Hi.
To summarize, for every m ∈M, there exists a neighbourhood U ∼= U1 × . . . ×
Uk of m in M, with the Ui being integral manifolds of Di, and the Levi-Civita
connection restricted to U being a product of the Levi-Civita connections on the
components Ui.
■
Deﬁnition 2.3.16 A Riemannian manifold (M, g) which is locally isomorphic to a
product of Riemannian manifolds is called locally reducible. It is called irreducible
if it is not locally reducible.
Clearly, by Theorem 2.3.15, if (M, g) is irreducible, then the restricted holonomy
group necessarily acts irreducibly. Under additional assumptions, de Rham [150]
was able to prove the following global version of Theorem 2.3.15.
Theorem 2.3.17 (Global de Rham Splitting Theorem) Let (M, g) be a geodesically
complete simply connected Riemannian manifold and assume that the holonomy
group24 of the Levi-Civita connection acts reducibly. Then, (M, g) is the direct prod-
uct of geodesically complete simply connected irreducible Riemannian manifolds
(Mi, gi),
(M, g) = (M0, g0) × (M1, g1) × . . . × (Mk, gk) .
Here, (M0, g0) is a Euclidean vector space whose dimension is possibly zero.
■
Remark 2.3.18 Both versions of the de Rham Splitting Theorem have been extended
to the case of an indeﬁnite metric by Wu [682, 683].
♦
Summarizing our discussion, for ﬁnding the possible holonomy groups of a Rie-
mannian manifold (M, g), it is reasonable to make the following assumptions:
(a) M is simply connected. This ensures that the holonomy group is connected and
that it coincides with the restricted holonomy group.
(b) (M, g) is irreducible. This implies that the holonomy group acts irreducibly.
(c) (M, g) is not locally symmetric. This requires K1(h) ̸= 0.
Under these assumptions, for the Riemannian case, Berger obtained the following.
Theorem 2.3.19 (Berger) Let (M, g) be an n-dimensional simply connected irre-
ducible Riemannian manifold which is not locally symmetric. Then, its holonomy
group H belongs to one of the following classes:

For the proof, which is beyond the scope of this book, we refer to [68, 69, 555].
Remark 2.3.20
1. An elegant proof of Theorem 2.3.19 is obtained from the following result of
Simons [591]: if M is irreducible, then either the holonomy group H acts tran-
sitively on Sn−1 or its identity component acts trivially on the space of curvature
tensors K(h). Then, Theorem 2.3.19 is obtained by using the classiﬁcation of
simple Lie algebras and their representations.
2. According to Examples 2.2.22 and 2.2.27, it was clear from the beginning
that the groups SO(n) and U(n) must occur in the above list. For a detailed
discussion of examples for all the groups occuring in Theorem 2.3.19, we refer
to [555].

2.4
Sectional Curvature
In this section, we discuss a generalization of the classical Gaussian curvature of
surfaces in R3. It reduces the study of the Riemann curvature to the study of real
valued functions. Let (M, g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Let Σm ⊂Tm M
be a 2-dimensional subspace such that g↾Σm is non-degenerate. Let {X, Y} be an
arbitrary basis of Σm. We put
K(Σm) :=
⟨R(X, Y)Y, X⟩
∥X ∥2∥Y ∥2 −⟨X, Y⟩2 ,
(2.4.1)

2.4 Sectional Curvature
139
where ∥· ∥2 and ⟨·, ·⟩are the quadratic form and the bilinear form, respectively,
induced from g. It can be easily shown that K(Σp) is well deﬁned, that is,
(a) the right hand side of (2.4.1) does not depend on the choice of the basis. This is a
simple consequence of the symmetry properties of R given by point 2 of Remark
2.3.7 and is, thus, left to the reader (Exercise 2.4.1).
(b) Σm is non-degenerate iff ∥X ∥2∥Y ∥2 −⟨X, Y⟩2 ̸= 0, (Exercise 2.4.2).
Note that K may be viewed as a mapping from the Graßmann manifold G2(Tm M)
to R. Let G0
2(Tm M) ⊂G2(Tm M) be the subset of non-degenerate subspaces.
Deﬁnition 2.4.1 The mapping K : G0
2(Tm M) →R given by (2.4.1) is called the
sectional curvature of the pseudo-Riemannian manifold at m ∈M.
Clearly, in the Riemannian case, every 2-dimensional subspace of Tm M is non-
degenerate.
Proposition 2.4.2 The curvature tensor R is completely determined by the sectional
curvature. If the mapping K is constant, that is, K(Σm) = k(m) for every Σm ∈
G0
2(Tm M), then
Rm(X, Y)Z = k(m)

⟨Y, Z⟩X −⟨X, Z⟩Y

.
(2.4.2)
Conversely, if (2.4.2) is fulﬁlled, then all non-degenerate planes have sectional cur-
vature k(m).
Proof The proof of the ﬁrst assertion is the consequence of the following simple
polarization argument. Denote α(X, Y) := ⟨R(X, Y)X, Y⟩, for any X, Y ∈Tm M.
Then, by direct inspection,
−6⟨R(X, Y)Z, W⟩= α(X + W, Y + Z) −α(X + W, Y) −α(X + W, Z)
−α(X, Y + Z) −α(W, Y + Z) + α(X, Z) + α(W, Y)
−α(Y + W, X + Z) + α(Y + W, X) + α(Y + W, Z)
+ α(Y, X + Z) + α(W, X + Z) −α(Y, Z) −α(W, X) ,
showing that R is determined by α and, thus, by K. We prove the second statement.
For that purpose, denote
R0(X, Y)Z := ⟨Y, Z⟩X −⟨X, Z⟩Y .
Note that R0 shares the symmetry properties (2.3.9), (2.3.10) and (2.3.12) of R.25
Assume that K(Σm) = k(m) for all non-degenerate planes. If X, Y span a non-
degenerate plane, then by (2.4.1),
⟨R(X, Y)Y, X⟩= k(m)

⟨Y, Y⟩X −⟨X, Y⟩Y

= ⟨k(m)R0(X, Y)Y, X⟩.
25It also shares the symmetry property (2.3.11), but this is not needed here.

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Thus, the tensor ˆR := R −k(m)R0 has the above symmetry properties and fulﬁls
⟨ˆR(X, Y)Y, X⟩= 0 .
(2.4.3)
If X and Y span a degenerate plane, we can choose sequences Xn →X and Yn →Y
of tangent vectors such that Xn and Yn span non-degenerate planes for each n.26
Then, ⟨ˆR(Xn, Yn)Yn, Xn⟩= 0 for all n and, thus, (2.4.3) holds for degenerate planes
as well. Finally, note that this equation is also true for pairs X, Y which are linearly
dependent. We conclude that (2.4.3) holds for all X, Y ∈Tm M. Now, the assertion
is a consequence of the following simple algebraic fact (Exercise 2.4.3): If
˜R : Tm M × Tm M × Tm M × Tm M →R
is a quadrilinear mapping sharing the symmetry properties (2.3.9), (2.3.10) and
(2.3.12) of R, then ⟨˜R(X, Y)Y, X⟩= 0 implies ˜R = 0.
The converse statement is trivial.
■
Proposition 2.4.2 leads us to an important class of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
Deﬁnition 2.4.3 If K(Σm) = k(m) for every Σm ∈G0
2(Tm M), then we say that
(M, g) is a space of constant curvature at m. Let k be a real number. We say that
(M, g) is a space of constant curvature k if K(Σm) = k at every point m ∈M.
Remark 2.4.4
1. By the proof of Proposition 2.4.2, for a space of constant curvature, we have
R(X, Y)Z = k

⟨Y, Z⟩X −⟨X, Z⟩Y

,
k ∈R .
(2.4.4)
2. By a theorem of Schur, see Theorem 2.2. in Chap. V of [381], if (M, g) is a space
of constant curvature at every point of M and dim M ≥3, then M is a space of
constant curvature, that is, the mapping m →k(m) is constant.
3. It is not hard to construct models of spaces of constant curvature. The simplest
Riemannian example is the n-sphere of radius r embedded in the standard way
in Rn+1. This is a space of constant curvature equal to 1
r2 . The simplest pseudo-
Riemannian model is the pseudo-Euclidean space (Rn
s , gn
s ) with the signature
(n −s, s). It is easy to show that this is a space of constant curvature equal to
0. In Sect.2.5, we will see a large class of spaces of constant curvature. For an
exhaustive presentation of this subject we refer to [676].
4. In the indeﬁnite case, there is a lot of subtleties and there is quite a number of
classical papers on that subject, see [63, 145, 257, 395, 490] and further references
therein.

26By property (b) above, in any ﬁxed basis of Tm M, ∥X ∥2∥Y ∥2 −⟨X, Y⟩2 is a polynomial in the
components of X and Y whose zero set does not contain any open subset.

then ⟨˜R(X, Y)Y, X⟩= 0 implies ˜R = 0.
2.5
Symmetric Spaces
In this section, we take up the discussion from Sect.2.3. We analyze the special case
K1(h) = 0, that is, we analyze the condition
DR = 0 ,
(2.5.1)
deﬁning locally symmetric manifolds, cf. Deﬁnition 2.3.2. Thus, we give up assump-
tion (c) prior to Theorem 2.3.19, but we keep on assuming the following.
(a) M is simply connected, which ensures that the holonomy group H is connected
and that it coincides with the restricted holonomy group.
(b) (M, g) is irreducible, which implies that H acts irreducibly.
Moreover, as above, we limit our attention to the Riemannian metric case, that is,
H ⊂O(n) is a compact Lie subgroup acting irreducibly on V ≡Rn. Then, by the
Holonomy Principle, cf. Proposition 1.7.20, the space of parallel sections of
E = O(M) ×O(n) S2 2V ∗
is in one-to-one correspondence with the space of holonomy-invariant vectors in
S2 2V ∗
as follows. Any R satisfying (2.5.1) is constant on Pu0(Γ ) and, restricted
to Pu0(Γ ), it takes values in K(h) given by (2.3.29). Thus, the Holonomy Principle
assigns to R the H-invariant element
F := R(u) ∈K(h),
u ∈Pu0(Γ ) .
(2.5.2)
Lemma 2.5.1 Let H ⊂O(n) be a closed subgroup and let F ∈K(h) be an H-
invariant element. Then, g = h ⊕V carries the structure of a Lie algebra given
by
[A, x] = −[x, A] = Ax ,
[x, y] = −F(x, y) ,
A ∈h , x, y ∈V .

Proof Bilinearity and anti-symmetry are obvious. We prove that the Jacobi identity
holds. For that purpose, we have to consider three cases:
(a) Let x, y, z ∈V . Since F(x, y) ∈h ⊂End(V ), the deﬁnition of K(h) implies
[[x, y], z] + [[y, z], x] + [[z, x], y] = 0 .
(b) Let x, y ∈V . By the H-invariance of F, cf. (2.1.25), we have
F(x, y) = Ad(a−1) ◦F(ax, ay) ,
a ∈H ⊂O(n) .
Differentiating this equation, we obtain
[F(x, y), A] + F(Ax, y) + F(x, Ay) = 0
for any A ∈h. This implies
[[x, y], A] + [[y, A], x] + [[A, x], y] = 0 .
(c) Let x ∈V and A, B ∈h. Then, by deﬁnition of the Lie bracket of h ⊂End(V ),
[A, B](x) = A(Bx) −B(Ax) .
This proves the third case.
■
To make contact with the standard notation, we denote V = m. Then,
g = h ⊕m
(2.5.3)
and the commutation relations of g fulﬁl:
[h, h] ⊂h ,
[h, m] ⊂m ,
[m, m] ⊂h .
(2.5.4)
Moreover, by the Ambrose-Singer Theorem,
[m, m] = h .
(2.5.5)
Associated with the decomposition (2.5.3), there is a linear mapping
λ : g →g ,
λ(A, x) := (A, −x) ,
A ∈h , x ∈m .
(2.5.6)
By (2.5.4), λ is an involutive Lie algebra homomorphism (Exercise 2.5.1). Con-
versely, we have the following.
Lemma 2.5.2 Any involutive Lie algebra homomorphism λ of a Lie algebra g
induces a decomposition g = h ⊕m fulﬁlling (2.5.4).

2.5 Symmetric Spaces
143
Proof Since λ2 = id, λ is diagonalizable and we may decompose g into the
eigenspaces h and m of λ corresponding to the eigenvalues +1 and −1, respec-
tively. Now, the ﬁrst relation in (2.5.4) is obvious. To check the remaining two, we
calculate
λ([A, x]) = [λ(A), λ(x)] = −[A, x] ,
A ∈h , x ∈m ,
that is, [A, x] ∈m. Similarly, λ([x, y]) = [x, y] ∈h for any x, y ∈m.
■
Deﬁnition 2.5.3 Let g be a Lie algebra and let λ be an involutive automorphism of
g. Then, the pair (g, λ) is called a symmetric Lie algebra. In addition,
1. if the set of ﬁxed points h of λ is a compactly embedded Lie subalgebra27 of g,
then (g, λ) is called an orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra,
2. if h ∩z = {0}, where z is the center of g, then (g, λ) is called effective.
3. if (g, λ) is effective and ad([m, m]) acts irreducibly on m, then (g, λ) is called
irreducible.
Proposition 2.5.4 The Lie algebra g constructed in Lemma 2.5.1, endowed with the
involutive automorphism λ given by (2.5.6), is an irreducible orthogonal symmetric
Lie algebra.
Proof By construction, (g, λ) is symmetric. Since, by assumption, H ⊂O(n) is a
compact Lie subgroup acting faithfully on Rn, ad(h) is compact and, thus, (g, λ) is
orthogonal. Suppose A ∈h ∩z. Then,
Ax = [A, x] = 0
for every x ∈m and, thus, A = 0. Thus, (g, λ) is effective. Finally, by assumption,
H acts irreducibly on m. Thus, ad(h) acts irreducibly on m, too. This, together with
(2.5.5) implies that (g, λ) is irreducible.
■
In the sequel, the pair (g, λ) constructed above will be called the canonical symmetric
Lie algebra associated with the locally symmetric Riemannian manifold we started
with. The decomposition (2.5.3) will be called the canonical decomposition of (g, λ).
The following proposition characterizes irreducible symmetric Lie algebras.
Proposition 2.5.5 Let (g, λ) be an irreducible symmetric Lie algebra and let g =
h ⊕m be the decomposition induced by λ. Then, one of the following cases occurs:
1. g is a simple Lie algebra.
2. g = ˜g ⊕˜g with ˜g simple, fulﬁlling h =

(A, A) : A ∈˜g

and λ(A, B) = (B, A)
for any A, B ∈˜g.
3. [m, m] = 0.
For the proof we refer the reader to [381].28
27That is, the group of transformations of g generated by ad(h) is compact.
28Cf. Proposition 7.5 in Vol. 2, Chap. XI of [381].

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Remark 2.5.6
1. Assume that either point 1 or point 2 of Proposition2.5.5 holds. Then, since
[m, m] ⊕m is an ideal in g, we have h = [m, m]. Thus, an effective symmetric
Lie algebra is irreducible iff h = [m, m], that is, iff g is of the form described
either by point 1 or by point 2. In particular, if (g, λ) is irreducible, then g is
semisimple.
2. Conversely, if (g, λ) is an orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra and g is simple, then
ad(h) acts irreducibly on m, see Proposition 7.4in Vol. 2, Chap. XI of [381].
♦
Proposition2.5.5 and property (2.5.5) imply that the canonical symmetric Lie algebra
(g, λ) is semisimple. Consequently, by Proposition I/5.4.10, the Killing form
k : g × g →R ,
k(X, Y) = tr(ad(X)ad(Y)) ,
of g is non-degenerate. Moreover, the relations (2.5.4) imply that the decomposition
(2.5.3) is orthogonal with respect to k (Exercise 2.5.2). Equivalently, k is λ-invariant.
This implies that the restrictions kh and km of k to h and m, respectively, are both
non-degenerate and λ-invariant, too. Moreover, they have the following properties:
(a) By Corollary I/5.5.8, kh is negative semideﬁnite and, since (g, λ) is effective, it
is negative deﬁnite.
(b) Since ad(h) acts irreducibly on m and since both km and the scalar product η on
m induced from the metric g are ad(h)-invariant, by Schur's Lemma, they must
be proportional to each other,
η(x, z) = −c km(x, z) ,
x, z ∈m , c ∈R , c ̸= 0 .
(2.5.7)
Thus, since η is positive deﬁnite, km is either positive or negative deﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 2.5.7 An effective orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra (g, λ) with g semi-
simple is said to be of compact or of non-compact type, if the restriction of the Killing
form of g to m is, respectively, negative deﬁnite or positive deﬁnite.
Remark 2.5.8 Combining Proposition 2.5.5 with Propositions 7.4 and 7.5in in Vol.
2, Chap. XI of [381], one can show that any irreducible orthogonal symmetric Lie
algebra is either of compact or of non-compact type.
♦
Next, we show that, given an irreducible orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra (g, λ),
one can construct a special type of homogeneous Riemannian manifold.
Let g = h ⊕m be the decomposition induced from λ. Let ˜G be the connected
simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra g and let ˜H be the connected Lie
subgroup corresponding to h. Then, the space of left cosets M := ˜G/ ˜H is a simply
connected manifold endowed with the natural left ˜G-action given by left translations.
Let
˜Z =

g ∈˜G : g(m) = m for all m ∈M


2.5 Symmetric Spaces
145
be the kernel of this action. Since, by assumption, (g, λ) is effective, ˜Z must be
discrete. Thus, M is an almost effective ˜G-manifold. We pass to an effective action
by setting G := ˜G/ ˜Z and H := ˜H/ ˜Z. Then, M = G/H, G and H are connected,
and we have the natural left effective action
δ : G × G/H →G/H ,
(a, [g]) →δa([g]) := [ag] .
By point 4 of Example 1.1.4, the natural projection π : G →M endows G with
the structure of a principal H-bundle P and the tangent mapping π′ identiﬁes m and
T[1]M as vector spaces. Under this identiﬁcation, the isotropy representation
H →Aut(T[1]M) ,
h →(δh)′
1 ,
is given by Ad(H) acting on m, cf. point 1 of Remark I/6.2.10. Correspondingly,
G ×Ad(H) m →TM ,
[(a, x)] →[L′
a(x)],
(2.5.8)
is an isomorphism. Since (g, λ) is orthogonal and irreducible, there exists an Ad(H)-
invariant scalar product η on m which is unique up to a positive factor. Clearly, η
induces an H-invariant scalar product on T[1]M which, using the left G-action δ, can
be extended to a G-invariant Riemannian metric g on M. To summarize, we have
constructed a simply connected transitive and effective G-manifold (M, g) with G
acting by isometries.
Consider the bundle of orthonormal frames O(M) of (M, g). Note that any η-
orthonormalbasis(e1, . . . , en)ofminducesviaπ′ a g-orthonormalframe(e1, . . . , en)
at [1] ∈M and, thus, an injective bundle morphism
ϑ : P →O(M) ,
ϑ(a) := (δ′
a(e1), . . . , δ′
a(en)) ,
(2.5.9)
projecting onto the identical diffeomorphism of M. The corresponding Lie group
homomorphism τ : H →O(n) ⊂GL(n, R) ∼= Aut(Tm M) is given by the adjoint
action of H on m ∼= T[1]M. To summarize, P is a subbundle of O(M).
Now, decompose the Maurer-Cartan form θ G ∈Ω1(G, g) with respect to (2.5.3):
θ G = θh + θm .
By Example 1.3.19, θh coincides with the canonical G-invariant connection29 ωc on
P. Recall that the corresponding horizontal distribution is generated by m, that is,
by left invariant vector ﬁelds a →(x∗)a = L′
a(x) with x ∈m.
Lemma 2.5.9 Under the morphism (ϑ, τ), θm corresponds to the soldering form θ
on O(M), that is, ϑ∗θ = θm.
29Note that this is a special case of the canonical invariant connection deﬁned in point 2 of Remark
1.9.14. It is obtained by setting G = H and λ = id there.

146
2
Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Proof By m-valuedness of θm and horizontality of θ, both ϑ∗θ and θm vanish on the
left invariant vector ﬁelds generated by elements of h. Thus, let x∗be generated by
x ∈m. Then, clearly θm(x∗) = x. On the other hand,
(ϑ∗θ)g(x∗) = ϑ(g)−1(ρ′ ◦ϑ′(x∗)) = ϑ(g)−1(π′(x∗)) = ϑ(g)−1(δ′
g ◦π′(x)) = x ,
where ρ : O(M) →M is the canonical projection.
■
Proposition 2.5.10 The Riemannian manifold (M, g) has the following properties:
1. Under the morphism (ϑ, τ), the Levi-Civita connection ω0 of (M, g) corresponds
to the canonical connection ωc, that is, ϑ∗ω0 = ωc.
2. The Riemann curvature of (M, g) is constant and given by the linear mapping
F : 2m →h ,
F(x, y) = −[x, y] .
(2.5.10)
3. The holonomy group based at ϑ(1) of ω0 is H and the holonomy bundle coincides
with P.
4. The Riemann curvature of (M, g) is parallel, that is, (M, g) is locally symmetric.
5. For any x ∈m, t →π(Lg exp(tx)) is a geodesic through [g] ∈M. Conversely,
every geodesic through [g] is of this form. In particular, M is geodesically com-
plete.
Proof 1. We decompose the commutator [θ G, θ G] ∈Ω2(G, g) with respect to
(2.5.3). By (2.5.4),
[θ G, θ G]h = [θh, θh] + [θm, θm] ,
[θ G, θ G]m = 2[θh, θm] .
(2.5.11)
Since the Levi-Civita connection is uniquely characterized by its covariant derivative
Dω0 on TM, it is enough to show that the covariant derivative Dωc induced by ωc
via the isomorphism (2.5.8) coincides with Dω0. This is done by showing that the
extension of ωc to O(M) is metric and torsionless. By Proposition 1.2.6, we may
view any vector ﬁeld X on M as an H-equivariant mapping ˜X : G →m and, thus,
Dωc ˜X = d ˜X + ad(ωc) ◦˜X = d ˜X + [θh, ˜X] ,
cf. Eq. (1.4.2). Let η be the (unique up to a positive factor) Ad(H)-invariant scalar
product on m. By Ad(H)-invariance, we obtain
η(Dωc ˜X, ˜Y) + η( ˜X, Dωc ˜Y) = d(η( ˜X, ˜Y)) .
This shows that the extension of ωc to O(M) is metric. It remains to show that
this extension is torsionless: restricting the Maurer-Cartan equation to m and using
(2.5.11) we get
Dωcθm = dθm + [θh, θm] = 0 .

2.5 Symmetric Spaces
147
But, by Lemma 2.5.9, ϑ∗θ = θm and, thus, ϑ∗Θ = 0. By uniqueness of the
Levi-Civita connection, the assertion follows.
2. By the Structure Equation, the curvature form of ωc is given by30
Ωc = −1
2[θm, θm] .
By point 1, ϑ∗Ω0 = Ωc. These two facts immediately imply (2.5.10).
3. By point 2 and by the Ambrose-Singer Theorem, the Lie algebra of the
holonomy group of ω0 is [m, m]. By point 1 of Remark 2.5.6, [m, m] = h and, thus,
the Lie algebra of the holonomy group of ω0 coincides with h. Since, by construction,
M is simply connected, the holonomy group of ω0 is connected and coincides with
the restricted holonomy group. On the other hand, since H is connected, too, we
obtain the assertion. It follows that P coincides with the holonomy bundle of ω0.
4. Since the curvature is constant on P and, thus, H-invariant, the Holonomy
Principle 1.7.20 implies the assertion.
5. By Proposition 2.1.22, the geodesics of (M, g) are given by the projections
of integral curves of horizontal standard vector ﬁelds on L(M). Since they are hor-
izontal, these curves may be chosen to lie in P. The restriction of B(y), y ∈Rn,
to P is given by the left-invariant vector ﬁeld generated by x = yiei ∈m, where
{ei} is a basis in m. Thus, here, the geodesics are given as projections of (global)
one-parameter subgroups t →exp(tx) and their left translates by arbitrary group
elements g ∈G.
■
By point 3 of Proposition 2.5.10, the irreducibility of (g, λ) implies that (M, g) is
irreducible. Together with points 4 and 5, this yields the following.
Corollary 2.5.11 (M, g) is a complete irreducible locally symmetric Riemannian
manifold.
■
Next, we show that the involutive automorphism λ induces a special symmetry for
any point m ∈M. Since any automorphism of a Lie algebra is the differential of a
unique automorphism of the corresponding simply connected Lie group,31 λ induces
a unique automorphism σ of ˜G. By (2.5.6), it fulﬁls σ( ˜H) = ˜H. Thus, σ descends
to an involutive diffeomorphism s : M →M. By construction,
s′
[1] : T[1]M →T[1]M ,
s′
[1](X) = −X .
(2.5.12)
Thus, under the identiﬁcation T[1]M = m, we have s′
[1] = λ↾m.
Lemma 2.5.12 The origin [1] of M is an isolated ﬁxed point of s. Moreover, s is an
isometry of the Riemannian metric g.
30Since ωc is a G-invariant connection, this is a special case of point 4 of Remark 1.9.14.
31For a proof, see e.g. Theorem 3.27 in [652].

148

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Proof The proof of the ﬁrst assertion is left to the reader (Exercise 2.5.4). To prove
the second statement, we have to show that the mapping
s′
m : Tm M →Tm M
is isometric. For the point m = [1], this follows immediately from (2.5.12), because
at the origin g coincides with η and the latter is λ-invariant. To prove the invariance
for an arbitrary point m = [g], note that for any g, h ∈G,
s(δg[h]) = s([gh]) = [σ(g)σ(h)] = δσ(g)[σ(h)] = δσ(g)s([h]) ,
that is, s ◦δg = δσ(g) ◦s. Differentiation of this identity yields
s′
[g] ◦(δg)′
[1] = (δσ(g))′
[1] ◦s′
[1] .
By construction, g is G-invariant and, thus, (δg)′
[1] and (δσ(g))′
[1] leave g invariant.
This yields the assertion.
■
Remark 2.5.13 For every g ∈˜Z, we have

σ(g)

(m) = s ◦g ◦s(m) = s2(m) = m.
Hence, σ( ˜Z) = ˜Z and σ descends to an automorphism of G, denoted by the same
symbol. One has σ(H) = H.
♦
Next, for any m = [g] ∈M, we deﬁne32
sm : M →M ,
sm := δg ◦s ◦δg−1 .
(2.5.13)
Differentiating (2.5.13), we obtain s′
m = δ′
g ◦s′
[1] ◦δ′
g−1 for any m = [g] ∈M. Thus,
by Lemma 2.5.12, by formula (2.5.12) and by the G-invariance of g, for any m ∈M,
sm is an involutive isometry of g fulﬁlling (Exercise 2.5.5)
sm(m) = m ,
(sm)′
m = −id .
(2.5.14)
The following remark yields a geometric interpretation of the symmetry sm.
Remark 2.5.14 Let t →γ (t) be a geodesic of (M, g) with γ (0) = m. Since an
isometry transforms geodesics to geodesics, t →τ(t) := sm(γ (t)) is a geodesic,
too. By (2.5.14), its tangent vector at t = 0 satisﬁes
˙τ(0) = (sm)′
m ˙γ (0) = −˙γ (0) .
(2.5.15)
Now, the uniqueness property of geodesics, see Corollary 2.1.23, implies τ(t) =
γ (−t). Thus, for any m ∈M,
32Clearly, this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representative.

2.5 Symmetric Spaces
149
sm(γ (t)) = γ (−t) ,
(2.5.16)
that is, sm reverses the geodesics through m.
♦
Deﬁnition 2.5.15 (Riemannian globally symmetric space) A Riemannian manifold
(M, g) is called globally symmetric if for each m ∈M there exists an involutive
isometry sm : M →M such that m is an isolated ﬁxed point of sm. The mapping sm
is called the symmetry of (M, g) at m.
Taking into account that, in the above construction of (M, g), the scalar product on
m is unique up to a positive constant and that a change of this constant implies a
conformal transformation of g, we obtain the following.
Proposition 2.5.16 To any irreducible33 orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra (g, λ)
there corresponds a unique homothetic equivalence class (M, [g]) of simply con-
nected irreducible Riemannian globally symmetric spaces.
■
It should be clear that the locally symmetric Riemannian manifold we started with
and the Riemannian globally symmetric space constructed here are deeply related.
Indeed, let (M, g) be a locally symmetric space. Let (g, λ) be its canonical symmetric
Lie algebra with canonical decomposition g = h ⊕m. Let η ∈S2(m∗) be the scalar
product on m deﬁned by g and let F ∈K(h) ⊂2m∗⊗h be the Riemann curvature
of (M, g). Let G/H be the Riemannian globally symmetric space constructed from
(g, λ). Then, for any chosen point m ∈M, via
Tm M ∼= m ∼= T[1]G/H
we obtain an isometric isomorphism between Tm M and T[1]G/H and, by point 2
of Proposition 2.5.10, M and G/H have the same Riemann curvature given by the
mapping F. By standard arguments,34 this implies the following.
Corollary 2.5.17 Every point of a locally symmetric space (M, g) admits a neigh-
bourhood isometric to a neighbourhood of the origin of the Riemannian globally
symmetric space constructed from the canonical symmetric Lie algebra of (M, g).
Note, however, that not every locally symmetric space is a Riemannian globally
symmetric space. It is even not necessarily homogeneous. As an example,35 let M
be a compact Riemann surface with genus ≥2, equipped with a Riemannian metric
of constant curvature equal to −1. Then, the isometry group of M is ﬁnite and, thus,
M is not homogeneous and, consequently, also not globally symmetric.
As an immediate consequence of the existence of the symmetries sm, we obtain
Proposition 2.5.18 Any Riemannian globally symmetric space (M, g) is complete.
33Remember that irreducibility includes effectiveness, cf. Deﬁnition 2.5.3.
34See Theorem 7.4 in Chap. VI of [381].
35This example is taken from [73].

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Proof Consider any geodesic t →γ (t) deﬁned on the interval [0, t0[. Apply the
symmetry sγ (t0−ε) to γ with some ε fulﬁlling 0 < ε < t0
2 . By (2.5.16), this opera-
tion extends the domain of γ to [0, 2t0 −2ε[. Continuing this procedure, we obtain
completeness of (M, g).
■
Next, given a Riemannian globally symmetric space (M, g), for every geodesic
t →γ (t) we consider the family of isometries
T γ
t := sγ ( t
2 ) ◦sγ (0) ,
(2.5.17)
called the transvections along γ . The following properties are immediate conse-
quences of (2.5.15) and (2.5.16) and are, therefore, left to the reader (Exercise 2.5.3).
Proposition 2.5.19 Let (M, g) be a Riemannian globally symmetric space and let
t →γ (t) be a geodesic. Then,
1. T γ
t acts on γ by translations, that is, T γ
t (γ (s)) = γ (t + s).
2. (T γ
t )′
γ (s) acts by parallel translation from γ (s) to γ (t + s) along γ , that is, for
any parallel vector ﬁeld X along γ ,
(T γ
t )′
γ (s)(X(γ (s)) = X(γ (t + s)) .
3.

T γ
t

t∈R is a 1-parameter group of isometries, that is, T γ

■
Recall from Example 2.2.16 that the isometry group I (M) of a Riemannian manifold
M is a Lie group. Let us denote its identity component by I0(M). By point 3 of
Proposition 2.5.19, for any geodesic γ , the transvections T γ
t form a subgroup (called
the transvection group) of I0(M). On the other hand, by a classical theorem of Hopf
and Rinow,36 any two points of a complete Riemannian manifold may be joined by
a geodesic. Using these two facts, we obtain the following.
Corollary 2.5.20 Let (M, g) be a Riemannian globally symmetric space. Then,
1. Geodesics in M are images of 1-parameter groups of isometries.
2. The identity component I0(M) acts transitively on M.
■
Proposition 2.5.21 Let (M, g) be an irreducible Riemannian globally symmetric
space and let G be a Lie group acting transitively and isometrically on M. If G acts
effectively, then G coincides with I0(M).
Proof Clearly, I0(M) is the largest connected group of isometries of (M, g). Denote
G′ = I0(M) and let g′ be its Lie algebra. Conjugation by s deﬁnes an automorphism
σ ′ of G′ which clearly restricts to the automorphism σ of G, cf. Remark 2.5.13. The
canonical decompositions g = h ⊕m and g′ = h′ ⊕m′ necessarily fulﬁl m′ = m.
Here h′ is the Lie algebra of the stabilizer of the chosen point on M under G′. Thus,
by Remark 2.5.6,
36See, e.g. [352].

2.5 Symmetric Spaces
151
h = [m, m] = [m′, m′] = h′ .
This implies g′ = g and, thus, G′ = G.
■
Thus, in the construction leading to Proposition 2.5.16, the Lie group G actually
coincides with I0(M). Now, we are able to prove the converse of Proposition 2.5.16.
Proposition 2.5.22 To any simply connected irreducible Riemannian globally sym-
metric space there corresponds a unique irreducible orthogonal symmetric Lie alge-
bra.
Proof Let (M, g) be a simply connected irreducible Riemannian globally symmetric
space. By Corollary 2.5.20, G = I0(M) acts transitively and effectively on M. Let
H be the isotropy group of this Lie group action at a chosen point o ∈M. By the
homotopy sequence of the ﬁbration H →G →G/H, the simply-connectedness of
G/H and the connectedness of G imply that H is connected. Moreover, by Theo-
rem 3.4 in Chap. VI of [381], the isotropy subgroup I (M)m at any point m ∈M is
compact. Hence, H = G ∩I (M)o is compact, too. Thus, M = G/H and, by stan-
dard arguments, π : G →M is a submersion. In particular, π′ : T1G →ToM is an
H-equivariant surjective linear mapping whose kernel coincides with T1H.
Let s be the symmetry at o. Since s is an involutive diffeomorphism, the mapping
g →σ(g) := s ◦g ◦s−1 deﬁnes aninvolutiveautomorphismof G. Let gandh bethe
Lie algebras of G and H, respectively. Clearly, λ := σ ′ is an involutive automorphism
of g. Let m be the eigenspace of λ corresponding to the eigenvalue −1. By (2.5.14),
π′(m) = ToM. We prove that h is the eigenspace of λ corresponding to the eigenvalue
+1: let
Gσ := {g ∈G : σ(g) = g}
be the ﬁxed point set of σ. By (2.5.14), s′
o commutes with the isotropy representation
of H at o and, thus, H is contained in Gσ. Conversely, if g ∈Gσ, then it commutes
with s and, thus, for any 1-parameter subgroup t →gt of Gσ,
s ◦gt(o) = gt ◦s(o) = gt(o) ,
that is, the orbit gt(o) is left invariant pointwise by s. Now, by Lemma 2.5.12, o is an
isolated ﬁxed point. Thus, gt(o) must coincide with o. But, gt(o) = o implies that
the 1-parameter subgroup t →gt is contained in H. Since a connected Lie group is
generated by its 1-parameter subgroups, we have (Gσ)0 ⊂H. Thus,
(Gσ)0 ⊂H ⊂Gσ .
This relation implies that h coincides with the (+1)-eigenspace of λ, indeed. To
summarize, the decomposition g = h ⊕m is canonical with respect to λ, that is,
(g, λ)isasymmetricLiealgebra.Since H iscompact,ad(h)isacompactlyembedded
Lie subalgebra of g, that is, (g, λ) is orthogonal. It remains to prove that (g, λ) is
irreducible. Since g is G-invariant, we are in the situation described by Proposition

2.5.10. By this proposition, H coincides with the holonomy group of the Levi-Civita
connection of g. Thus, the irreducibility of (M, g), together with the effectiveness
of the action of G on M, implies the irreducibility of (g, λ).
■
Remark 2.5.23 In the course of the above proof, we have found the following struc-
ture: a triple (G, H, σ) fulﬁlling
1. G is a connected Lie group and H is a closed subgroup,
2. σ is an involutive automorphism of G such that (Gσ)0 ⊂H ⊂Gσ,
3. Ad(H) is compact,
is called a Riemannian symmetric pair. This notion clearly constitutes a link between
symmetric spaces and symmetric Lie algebras.
♦
Combining Proposition 2.5.16 with Proposition 2.5.22, we obtain the following.
Theorem 2.5.24 The homothetic equivalence classes of simply connected irre-
ducible Riemannian globally symmetric spaces are in one-to-one correspondence
with the irreducible orthogonal symmetric Lie algebras.
■
This theorem reduces the classiﬁcation of symmetric spaces of the above type to the
classiﬁcation of irreducible symmetric Lie algebras of compact or of non-compact
type. According to a beautiful duality,37 the problem further reduces to the classi-
ﬁcation of irreducible symmetric Lie algebras of the non-compact type. The latter
can be shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the real simple Lie algebras
of non-compact type. If the complexiﬁcation of such a Lie algebra is simple as a
complex Lie algebra, then M is said to be of type III, otherwise M is said to be
of type IV. The corresponding compact irreducible symmetric spaces are obtained
by duality and are referred to as of type I and II, respectively. The complete list of
simply connected irreducible symmetric spaces with symmetry group being a clas-
sical Lie group is given in Tables2.1 and 2.2.38 Here, SO0(p, q) denotes the identity
component of SO(p, q) and SO∗(2n) is the subgroup of SO(2n, C) satisfying
gTJ0g = J0 ,
gTg = 12n .
For the corresponding list with exceptional Lie groups we refer to the textbook
of Helgason [293]. As already mentioned, there the reader may ﬁnd an exhaustive
presentation of the whole subject.
Remark 2.5.25 Note that in our considerations, we have excluded the class of sym-
metric Lie algebras fulﬁlling [m, m] = 0, cf. case 3 in Proposition 2.5.5. Symmetric
Lie algebras with this property are said to be of Euclidean type. By point 2 of Proposi-
tion 2.5.10, they are necessarily ﬂat. One can show that if G/H is simply connected,
37See Sect.8 of Chap. XI in [381] or Sect.2 of Chap. V in [293].
38By deﬁnition, the rank is the dimension of some maximal Abelian subspace of m. Any two
maximal Abelian subspaces of m are Ad(H)-conjugate.

then a symmetric space of this type is isometric to some Euclidean space Rn. Clearly,
Rn itself provides the simplest example, with the symmetry at the origin given by
s : x →−x.
♦
Next, we show that Riemannian symmetric spaces provide Riemannian manifolds
of certain types met before. Recall that if (g, λ) is irreducible, then g is necessarily
semisimple and thus, the Killing form k is non-degenerate. As already noted, this
implies
η(x, z) = −c km(x, z) ,
x, z ∈m ,
(2.5.18)
for some c ∈R, c ̸= 0, cf. (2.5.7). Recall from point 2 of Proposition 2.5.10 that the
curvature mapping R is given by the mapping F, cf. formula (2.5.10). Substituting
x = F(u, v)w into (2.5.18) and using the ad(h)-invariance of k, we obtain
η(F(u, v)w, z) = c km([[u, v], w], z) = c kh([u, v], [w, z]) .
(2.5.19)
Setting x = u = z and y = v = w in (2.5.19), we immediately obtain the following
formula for the sectional curvature:
η(F(x, y)y, x) = −c kh([x, y], [x, y]) .
(2.5.20)

(2.5.21)
Proposition 2.5.26 Let (M, g) be an irreducible Riemannian globally symmetric
space and let (g, λ) be the corresponding irreducible orthogonal symmetric Lie
algebra.
1. If (g, λ) is of compact type, then (M, g) is a compact Einstein manifold with
non-negative sectional curvature and positive deﬁnite Ricci tensor.
2. If (g, λ) is of non-compact type, then (M, g) is a simply connected Einstein man-
ifold with non-positive sectional curvature and negative deﬁnite Ricci tensor.
Moreover, M is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space.
Proof Let g = h ⊕m be the canonical decomposition. By Theorem 2.5.24, G =
I0(M) acts transitively and effectively on M and g is G-invariant. Since kh is negative
deﬁnite, the statements about the sectional curvature K follow immediately from
(2.5.20). Since the Ricci tensor Ric is a symmetric ad(h)-invariant bilinear form on
m and since ad(h) acts irreducibly on m, Ric must be proportional to the metric, that
is, (M, g) is an Einstein space.
1. Let (g, λ) be of compact type. Then, K is non-negative and, thus, Ric is semi-
positive deﬁnite. Since M is Einstein, Ric is either positive deﬁnite or zero. But if
Ric is zero, then (2.3.27) implies that K must also be zero, which contradicts the non-
degeneracy of k and, thus, the irreducibility of (g, λ). Finally, since km is negative
deﬁnite, k is negative deﬁnite and, since g is semisimple, G is compact. Thus, M is
compact.
2. Let (g, λ) be of non-compact type. Then, by similar arguments, M is Einstein
with negative deﬁnite Ricci tensor. The remaining statement follows from Theorem
8.3 in Chap. VIII of [381].
■
In the remainder of this section, we present the symmetric space structure of a few
of the types in Table2.1 explicitly. By Theorem 2.5.24, it is enough to exhibit the
corresponding symmetric Lie algebra structure. For a much more detailed discussion
of examples we refer to Chap. XI of [381] and to [692]. We leave it to the reader to
check the statements below (Exercise 2.5.6).
Example 2.5.27
1. Consider type I in lines 3, 4, and 7 of Table2.1. Lines 3 and 7 correspond to the
Graßmann manifolds
GK(k, n) ∼= UK(n)/(UK(n −k) × UK(k)) ,
K = C, H ,

The corresponding symmetric Lie algebra is given by

The action of Ad(H) on m is given by

and the involutive automorphism λ acts via

The corresponding involutive automorphism σ is given by conjugation with

(2.5.22)
2. Consider the special case p = n and q = 1 for type I in line 4 of Table2.1:
Sn = SR(1, n + 1) = SO(n + 1)/SO(n) .
The underlying symmetric Lie algebra is given by
o(n + 1) = o(n) ⊕m ,
(2.5.23)

Then, Ad(SO(n)) gets identiﬁed with the basic representation of SO(n) on Rn
and, under the identiﬁcation m ∼= Rn, the Euclidean scalar product on Rn yields

a scalar product on m which coincides with the restriction of the Killing form on
o(n + 1) to m up to the factor −2(n −1). The involutive automorphisms are read
off from the previous point.
3. Consider type I in line 5 of Table2.1. One easily shows that SO(2n)/U(n) is the
space of orthogonal complex structures on the 2n-dimensional Euclidean space.40
Here we decompose41
o(2n) = u(n) ⊕m ,

The involutive automorphism λ : o(2n) →o(2n) corresponding to this decom-
position is given by conjugation with the matrix
J0 =

.
4. Consider type I in line 1 of Table2.1. Recall from Sect.7.6 of Part I that U(n)/O(n)
is the space of Lagrangian subspaces of R2n endowed with its canonical sym-
plectic structure. Correspondingly, SU(n)/SO(n) is called the space of special
Lagrangian subspaces. Here, we decompose
su(n) = o(n) ⊕m ,
with
o(n) =

this embedding, the involutive automorphism λ : su(n) →su(n) is given by

5. Consider type III in line 4 of Table2.1 with p = 1, that is, M = SO0(1, n)/SO(n).
On the level of Lie algebras, we have to consider the pseudo-Euclidean space
(R1,n, η) with η = 11,n given by (2.5.22). Then,
o(n, 1) =

.
It is obvious that M may be identiﬁed with the hypersurface H+(1, n) ⊂R1,n
deﬁned by
η(u, u) = −1 ,
u0 ≥1 .
Therefore, M is referred to as the hyperbolic space form of (R1,n, η).
♦
Remark 2.5.28 Consider the example of the n-sphere above. By Example 1.1.18,
under the identiﬁcation m ∼= Rn, the bundle of orthonormal frames O(Sn) coincides
with the principal SO(n)-bundle SO(n + 1) →SO(n + 1)/SO(n) and, by Propo-
sition 2.5.10, the Levi-Civita connection on Sn with respect to the natural metric
coincides with the SO(n + 1)-invariant canonical connection on this bundle. The
curvature (2.5.10) reads F(x, y) = x ∧y . Comparing with (2.4.2), this shows that
Sn has a constant sectional curvature equal to 1.

2.6
Compatible Connections on Vector Bundles
Here, we take up the discussion of Sect.2.2. We consider real or complex vector
bundles endowed with a ﬁbre metric h and an h-compatible connection ∇. Such a
structure will be denoted by (E, h, ∇). In the ﬁrst part, we will collect what we know
already for the case of real (pseudo-)Riemannian base manifolds (M, g), and in the
second part we will pass to complex base manifolds and Hermitean vector bundles
endowed additionally with a holomorphic structure.
First, recall Examples 2.2.19 and 2.2.27.
(a) O(k,l)-structures are in one-to-one correspondence with pseudo-Riemannian
manifolds(M, g)ofdimension(k + l),wheretheO(k,l)-structurecoincideswiththe
bundle O(M) of frames which are orthonormal with respect to g. A linear connection
ω on M is compatible with the O(k,l)-structure iff g is parallel with respect to ω.
Such a connection is called metric.
(b) U(n)-structures are in one-to-one correspondence with 2n-dimensional almost
Hermitean manifolds (M, g, J) or, equivalently, with Hermitean ﬁbre metrics on
TM relative to a given J. A linear connection ω on M is compatible with the U(n)-
structure iff both g and J are parallel with respect to ω. Such a connection is called
unitary. Equivalently, ω is unitary iff the Hermitean ﬁbre metric h in TM deﬁned by
g and J is parallel with respect to ω.
More generally, as we know from Examples 1.6.6 and 1.6.12, a connection ∇on
a real or complex vector bundle (E, h) is compatible with h iff
∇h = 0 ,
(2.6.1)
which is equivalent to
X(h(s1, s2)) = h(∇Xs1, s2) + h(s1, ∇Xs2) ,
(2.6.2)
for any X ∈X(M) and s1, s2 ∈Γ ∞(E). Since h may be viewed as a section of the
associated bundle L(E) ×GL(n,K) F, where F denotes the space of ﬁbre metrics,
(2.6.1) is equivalent to
Dω ˜h = 0 ,
(2.6.3)
whereω istheconnectionformon L(E)and ˜h : L(E) →F isthe G-homomorphism
corresponding to ∇and h, respectively. The metric h deﬁnes a reduction to the
subbundle of orthonormal frames
O(E) =

u ∈L(E) : ˜h(u) = h0

,
where h0 = 1p,q in the real and h0 = 1 in the complex case. By compatibility, ω
is reducible to O(E). In the (pseudo-)Riemannian case, the restriction of equation
(2.6.3) to O(E) reads

ωT ⊗1 + 1 ⊗ωT 
(h0) = 0

2.6 Compatible Connections on Vector Bundles
159
and in the Hermitean case, we obtain

ωT ⊗1 + 1 ⊗ωT 
(h0) = 0 .
Thus, ∇is h-compatible iff ω is metric or unitary for K = R or C, respectively.
Remark 2.6.1
1. By Proposition 1.3.7, O(E) admits a connection. Thus, every (pseudo-)
Riemannian or Hermitean vector bundle admits a compatible connection.
2. Using the isomorphisms given by (1.2.4) and by Proposition 1.6.7, we have
E ∼= L(E) ×GL(k,K) Kk ∼= O(E) ×G Kk ,
where G = O(p, q) in the (pseudo-)Riemannian and G = U(k) in the Hermitean
case. Since ˜h is constant on O(E), without loss of generality, we can limit our
attention to the following setting. Let P(M, G) be a principal G-bundle over
an oriented (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold (M, g) and let E = P ×G F be an
associated vector bundle such that (F, G, σ) is a ﬁnite-dimensional representation
space carrying a σ-invariant inner product ⟨·, ·⟩F. Then, ⟨·, ·⟩F induces a ﬁbre
metric on E via
h(e1, e2) := ⟨f1, f2⟩F ,
(2.6.4)
with e1 = [(p, f1)] and e2 = [(p, f2)]. By G-invariance of ⟨·, ·⟩F, this deﬁnition
does not depend on the choice of representatives.
♦
For the remainder, let us assume that M is a complex manifold. Recall that a com-
plex manifold of dimension n is a real manifold of dimension 2n endowed with an
equivalence class of holomorphic atlases.
Deﬁnition 2.6.2 A complex vector bundle E over a complex manifold M is called
holomorphic if E admits a system of local trivializations whose transition functions
are holomorphic.
Note that such a system of trivializations turns E into a complex manifold such that
the projection π : E →M is holomorphic. Also note that, since the composition of
anti-holomorphic mappings need not be anti-holomorphic, there is no notion of an
anti-holomorphic vector bundle.
Remark 2.6.3
1. For a complex manifold of complex dimension n, one can deﬁne the principal
GL(n, C)-bundle C(M) of complex linear frames in the same way as in the real
case, cf. Example 2.2.10. Correspondingly, any holomorphic vector bundle E of
rank k over M may be viewed as associated with its complex linear frame bundle
C(E), that is, E ∼= C(E) ×GL(k,C) Ck.

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
2. As in the C∞-case, any functorial construction in linear algebra gives rise to
holomorphic vector bundles. In particular, one can build the dual bundle, direct
sums and tensor products, see [336] for details.
♦
The basic example of a holomorphic vector bundle is provided by the holomorphic
tangent bundle of a complex manifold M. Let (Ui, ϕi)i∈I be a holomorphic atlas of
M with transition mappings ϕi j and let zi be the complex coordinates corresponding
to ϕi. Consider the Jacobian
J (ϕi j)(ϕ j(z)) :=
∂ϕk
i j
∂zl (ϕ j(z))
of the transition mappings.
Deﬁnition 2.6.4 (Holomorphic tangent bundle) The holomorphic tangent bundle
of a complex manifold M of dimension n is the holomorphic vector bundle T M
over M of rank n given by the transition functions ψi j(z) = J (ϕi j)(ϕ j(z)).
The dual T ∗M of T M is called the holomorphic cotangent bundle. Clearly, { ∂
∂zk }
and {dzk} provide local frames in T M and T ∗M, respectively.
Let J be the natural almost complex structure of the complex manifold M, cf.
Proposition 2.2.11. Consider the decomposition (2.2.17) deﬁned by J. It is easy
to see that T1,0M has the same transition functions as T M (Exercise 2.6.1). This
implies the following.
Proposition 2.6.5 If M is a complex manifold, then T1,0M is naturally isomorphic
to the holomorphic tangent bundle T M.
■
Note that the induced tensor bundles p T1,0M and kT1,0M are holomorphic,
whereas kT0,1M is not holomorphic.
Next, recall the decomposition (2.2.18). For a complex vector bundle E over a
complex manifold M, let Ω p,q(M, E) be the space of E-valued (p, q)-forms on M.
Proposition 2.6.6 Let π : E →M be a holomorphic vector bundle. Then, there
exists a C-linear differential operator ∂E : Ω p,q(M, E) →Ω p,q+1(M, E) fulﬁlling
∂
2
E = 0 and the Leibniz rule
∂E( f α) = ∂( f ) ∧α + f ∂E(α) ,
for any function f on M and any α ∈Ω p,q(M, E).
Proof Let (e1, . . . , ek) be a local holomorphic frame42 in E over U ⊂M. Then,
locally, anyα ∈Ω p,q(M, E) maybewrittenas α = 
i αi ⊗ei, withαi ∈Ω p,q(M).
We deﬁne
42That is, every ei : U →E is a holomorphic mapping.

■
The mapping ∂E is called the Dolbeault operator. It gives rise to a cohomology theory,
see Example 5.7.25 and [336] for much more material.43 Now, let
∇: Γ ∞(E) →Ω1(M, E)
be a connection on E. Taking the complexiﬁcation of T∗M, we extend it to an operator
∇: Γ ∞(E) →Ω1
C(M, E) .
According to (2.2.18), the latter decomposes as follows:
∇= ∇1,0 + ∇0,1 .
(2.6.5)
Deﬁnition 2.6.7 A connection ∇on a holomorphic vector bundle E is called com-
patible with the holomorphic structure if ∇0,1 = ∂E on Γ ∞(E).
Note that for a compatible connection, the following are equivalent: for any local
section ϕ of E, ∇0,1ϕ = 0 iff ϕ is holomorphic.
Proposition 2.6.8 Let (E, h) be a holomorphic Hermitean vector bundle over the
complex manifold M. Then, there exists a unique connection ∇on E which is com-
patible both with the holomorphic and with the Hermitean structure.
Proof Let ∇be a connection fulﬁlling the compatibility assumptions and let ω be its
connection form. Let e = (e1, . . . , ek) be a local holomorphic frame, let A = e∗ω
be the local representative of ω and let H be the matrix of h with respect to e, that
is, Hi j = h(ei, e j). Taking the pullback of the compatibility condition (2.6.2) under
e, we obtain
dH = A TH + H A .
(2.6.6)
To analyze the compatibility of ∇with the holomorphic structure, we act with ∇on
a local holomorphic section ϕ. Then,
0 = ∇0,1ϕ = ∂ϕ + A 0,1ϕ .
43Note that there is no analogue of the ∂-operator.

162

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Thus, A 0,1 = 0, that is, A is of type (1, 0). Now, decomposing both sides of (2.6.6)
into their (1, 0) and (0, 1)-parts, we read off ∂H = A TH and ∂H = HA and, thus,
A = H
−1∂H .
This formula deﬁnes unique compatible connections on each open subset belonging
to a system of local trivializations. It is easy to check that, by passing to another local
holomorphic frame, these local 1-forms transform properly. Thus, using a partition
of unity, they may be glued together to a compatible connection on C(M).
■
Deﬁnition 2.6.9 The unique connection given by Proposition 2.6.8 is called the
Chern connection, or the canonical connection, of the holomorphic Hermitean vector
bundle (E, h).
Corollary 2.6.10 Let (E, h) be a holomorphic Hermitean vector bundle, let ∇be
its Chern connection and let ω and Ω be the connection and curvature form of ∇,
respectively. Let A = e∗ω and F = e∗Ω be the local representatives with respect
to a local holomorphic frame e and let H be the matrix of h with respect to e. Then,
A = H
−1∂H ,
F = ∂A ,
(2.6.7)
that is, A is of type (1, 0) and F is of type (1, 1).
Proof The ﬁrst assertion follows from the proof of Proposition 2.6.8. We show the
second one: using the explicit expression for A , together with ∂2 = 0 and ∂H −1 =
−H −1 · ∂H · H −1, we obtain ∂A = −A ∧A . Then,
F = dA + A ∧A = ∂A .
Since A is of type (1, 0), F is of type (1, 1).

Example 2.6.11 Inparticular,wemayconsidertheholomorphictangentbundleT M
of a complex manifold M endowed with its Chern connection. According to (2.2.13),
TM viewed as a complex vector bundle is C-linearly isomorphic to T1,0M. On the
other hand, by Proposition 2.6.5, T1,0M is naturally isomorphic to T M. Thus, we
have a vector bundle isomorphism Φ : TM →T M which can be used to transport
the Chern connection to TM. The image can be compared with the Levi-Civita
connection, see the Appendix to Chap.4 in [336] for details. In particular, if (M, g) is
Kähler, then under Φ, the Chern connection and the Levi-Civita connection coincide.
♦
The following theorem states a converse of Proposition 2.6.8. Our proof is along the
lines of [384], cf. Proposition 1.3.7 there.
Theorem 2.6.12 Let (E, h) be a Hermitean vector bundle over a complex manifold
M and let ∇be a Hermitean connection on E such that its curvature Ω is of type
(1, 1), that is, Ω ∈Ω1,1(M, End(E)). Then, there exists a holomorphic structure on
E such that ∇is the canonical connection with respect to this structure.

Proof Let C(E) be the principal GL(k, C)-bundle of complex linear frames asso-
ciated with E, that is, E ∼= C(E) ×GL(k,C) Ck. Clearly, we may view GL(k, C) as
a complex manifold. Let JM and JG be the almost complex structures on M and
GL(k, C), respectively, deﬁned by the complex manifold structures. Let ω be the
connection form on C(E) corresponding to ∇and let Γ ⊂T(C(E)) be its horizon-
tal distribution. Then, we have a unique almost complex structure on C(E) deﬁned
by ω, JM and JG as follows: Take the splitting T(C(E)) = V ⊕Γ , lift JM from TM
to Γ and deﬁne J on T(C(E)) as the direct sum of this lift and of JG. By construc-
tion, J is invariant under the right GL(k, C)-action. Thus, J and the natural almost
complex structure of Ck combine to an almost complex structure on E denoted by
the same symbol.
We prove that Ω ∈Ω1,1(M, End(E)) implies that J is integrable. It is enough
to give the proof in a local trivialization of E. For a chosen local trivialization
π−1(U) ∼= U × Ck, let (z1, . . . , zn) be complex local coordinates on U ⊂M and let
(w1, . . . , wk) be the complex coordinates on Ck with respect to the standard basis.
Let A be the local representative of ω on U and let A αβ be its components with
respect to the standard basis

of the Lie algebra gl(k, C). We decompose A
with respect to JM,
A = A 1,0 + A 0,1 .

where (Eβα)∗is the Killing vector ﬁeld generated by Eβα. Now, the horizontal
distribution on E corresponding to Γ is given by (1.3.4). Here, since Ck is the basic
GL(k, C)-module,

z(A∗u) = u(Az) ,
z ∈Ck , u ∈C(E) , A ∈gl(k, C) .

that J is integrable.
It remains to prove that, with respect to the holomorphic structure deﬁned by J,
∇coincides with the Chern connection. That is, we have to prove that a local section
ϕ : U →E fulﬁlling ∇0,1ϕ = 0 is holomorphic. For that purpose, it is enough to
show that any ϕ fulﬁlling this condition pulls back every (1, 0)-form on E to a

Hodge Theory. The Weitzenboeck Formula
Let us recall some basic notions from Sects.4.4 and 4.5 of Part I. Consider an n-
dimensional oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g) with signature (r, s). The
metric g yields a distinguished volume form vg, cf. Deﬁnition I/4.4.4., and a mapping
∗: Ωk(M) →Ωn−k(M) ,
∗α := (−1)sg−1(α) ⌟vg ,
(2.7.1)
called the Hodge star operator, cf. Deﬁnition I/4.5.1. We immediately read off

We have the following further basic properties: for any α, β ∈Ωk(M),
∗∗α = (−1)k(n−k)+s α ,
(2.7.3)
g−1(∗α, ∗β) = (−1)sg−1(α, β) ,
(2.7.4)

(2.7.5)
cf. Proposition I/4.5.3. Let {ei} be an orthonormal local frame on M and let {ϑi} be
the dual coframe. Then, locally, we have

(2.7.7)
Using (2.7.7), for any α ∈Ωk(M), one easily shows the following:
(∗α)(Xk+1, . . . , Xn)vg = α ∧g(Xk+1) ∧. . . ∧g(Xn) .
(2.7.8)
This implies
X⌟∗α = ∗(α ∧g(X)) ,
(2.7.9)
g−1(β)⌟∗α = ∗(α ∧β) ,
(2.7.10)
for any α ∈Ω∗(M), β ∈Ω1(M) and X ∈X(M) (Exercise 2.7.1). The metric
induces a natural ﬁbre metric on E = kT∗M via
⟨α, β⟩:= (−1)sg−1(α, β) ,
which gives rise to an L2-inner product on the space of square-integrable k-forms:

Using this inner product, one deﬁnes the Hodge dual d∗: Ωk(M) →Ωk−1(M) of
the exterior derivative by
⟨d∗α, β⟩L2 := ⟨α, dβ⟩L2 ,
(2.7.12)
for all β ∈Ωk−1(M). For α ∈Ωk(M), one has

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Given the exterior derivative and its Hodge dual, we build the Hodge-Laplace oper-
ator of (M, g):
□: Ωk(M) →Ωk(M) ,
□:= dd∗+ d∗d .
(2.7.14)
Clearly,
⟨□α, α⟩L2 = ⟨dα, dα⟩L2 + ⟨d∗α, d∗α⟩L2 .
(2.7.15)
Moreover,
d □= □d ,
d∗□= □d∗,
∗□= □∗.
(2.7.16)
Finally, we note that □is symmetric:
⟨□α, β⟩L2 = ⟨α, □β⟩L2 .
(2.7.17)
The proof of these elementary properties is left to the reader (Exercise 2.7.2).
Remark 2.7.1 (Hodge decomposition) In this Remark, we assume that (M, g) is a
compact oriented n-dimensional Riemannian manifold.
Since g is Riemannian, the inner product (2.7.11) is positive deﬁnite. Then,
(2.7.15) implies that □is positive deﬁnite and that
□α = 0 iff dα = 0 and d∗α = 0 .
(2.7.18)
Since □= (d + d∗)2, we also have
ker(□) = ker(d + d∗) .
(2.7.19)
A k-form α fulﬁlling □α = 0 is called harmonic. We conclude that the only harmonic
functions on a compact connected oriented Riemannian manifold are the constant
functions. This in turn implies that if, additionally, the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology of
M is trivial, then there does not exist any nontrivial harmonic 1-form on M (Exercise
2.7.3). The space of harmonic k-forms is denoted by
H k(M) :=

α ∈Ωk(M) : □α = 0

.
In Sect.5.7 we will see that the Hodge-Laplace operator on a compact oriented
Riemannian manifold is elliptic. The theory of elliptic operators implies that, for
any k, H k(M) is ﬁnite-dimensional. Moreover, the following orthogonal direct sum
decomposition, called Hodge decomposition, holds.46
Theorem 2.7.2 (Hodge Decomposition Theorem)
Ωk(M) = H k(M) ⊕□(Ωk(M)) .
(2.7.20)
46Clearly, by the elementary properties of □proved above, the second summand can be decomposed
further, □(Ωk(M)) = d(Ωk−1(M)) ⊕d∗(Ωk+1(M)).

2.7 Hodge Theory. The Weitzenboeck Formula
167
The proof will be given in a more general context in Chap.5, see Theorem 5.7.18.
The Hodge decomposition has the following immediate consequences:
1. The natural mapping
F : H k(M) →H k
dR(M) ,
α →[α] ,
is an isomorphism, that is, every de Rham cohomology class contains a unique
harmonic form. To prove injectivity of F, take two harmonic k-forms α and β
belonging to the same cohomology class. Then, there exists a (k −1)-form τ
such that α −β = dτ. Then,
∥α −β ∥2
L2= ⟨α −β, dτ⟩L2 = ⟨d∗α −d∗β, τ⟩L2 = 0 ,
and thus α = β. To prove surjectivity, take an arbitrary class [α] ∈H k
dR(M) and
represent it by some closed form α ∈Zk(M). Then, by the Hodge decomposition
(2.7.20), there exists an element ω ∈H k(M) and a k-form β such that
α = ω + □β.
Since dω = 0, we have 0 = dα = dd∗dβ and thus
⟨d∗dβ, d∗dβ⟩L2 = ⟨dβ, dd∗dβ⟩L2 = 0 .
This implies d∗dβ = 0 and thus α = ω + dd∗β, showing that [ω] = [α].

dR(M), we must ﬁnd
a cohomology class [β] ∈H n−k
dR (M) such that

M α ∧β ̸= 0. For that purpose,
we choose a Riemannian metric g on M. By point 1, we may choose a harmonic
representative α of [α] which, of course, cannot vanish identically. Then, by the
third identity in (2.7.16), ∗α is also harmonic and thus, by (2.7.18), it is closed.
This means that ∗α represents a cohomology class in H n−k
dR (M). Pairing this
element with [α] yields

♦
Below, we wish to prove the Weitzenboeck Formula which, combined with the the-
ory of harmonic forms, yields deep insight into the relation between curvature and
topology. It compares the Hodge-Laplace operator of (M, g) to the Bochner-Laplace
operator built from the Levi-Civita connection ∇of g. The basic object relating these
two quantities is the Weitzenboeck curvature operator built from the curvature endo-
morphism of ∇. In order to accomplish this goal, we need a uniﬁed treatment of
these objects in terms of the Koszul calculus. Thus, we consider the vector bundle
E = kT∗M endowed with its natural ﬁbre metric ⟨·, ·⟩deﬁned above and with the
natural connection induced from the Levi-Civita connection,47 which we also denote
by ∇. Clearly, ∇is compatible with ⟨·, ·⟩. Then, we proceed as follows:
(a) We express the Hodge dual operator d∗in terms of ∇. Recall that d has been
already calculated in terms of ∇, cf. formula (2.2.49).
(b) We deﬁne the Bochner-Laplace operator and calculate it in terms of ∇. Since
this can be done without any modiﬁcations for an arbitrary Riemannian (or
Hermitean) vector bundle endowed with a compatible connection, we present it
for this general case. This will also be useful later on.
(c) We deﬁne the Weitzenboeck curvature operator and derive the Weitzenboeck
Formula.
(a) Let ω be the connection form of ∇. Let e = {ei} be a local frame and let {ϑi}
be its dual coframe. By (2.1.39), the local representative of ω with respect to e is
given by e∗ωi k = Γ i jkϑ j, where Γ i jk are the Christoffel symbols with respect to e.
Lemma 2.7.3 For any X ∈X(M) and α ∈Ω∗(M),
∇Xvg = 0 ,
∇X ∗α = ∗∇Xα .
(2.7.22)
Proof As an immediate consequence of (2.7.6), (2.1.47) and (2.2.44), for any ortho-
normal frame {ei}, we have
∇ei vg = (−1)s+1

i jϑ1 ∧. . . ∧ϑn = 0 .
This proves the ﬁrst assertion. To prove the second one, we act with ∇X on equation
(2.7.5). Using ∇Xvg = 0, ∇Xg = 0 and once again (2.7.5), we obtain
∇Xα ∧∗β + α ∧∇X ∗β = (−1)s
g−1(∇Xα, β) + g−1(α, ∇Xβ)

vg
= ∇Xα ∧∗β + α ∧∗∇Xβ ,
for arbitrary forms α and β. From this we read off the second assertion.

Lemma 2.7.4 Let (M, g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and let α ∈Ωk(M).
Let {ei} be a local frame and let {ϑi} be its dual coframe. Then,
d∗α = −g−1(ϑ j)⌟∇e jα .

Comparison with (2.7.13) yields the assertion.
■
Remark 2.7.5 Since the operator d∗is intrinsically deﬁned, formula (2.7.23) does
not depend on the choice of the frame. Using g−1(ϑ j) = g jkek, it reads
(d∗α)(X2, . . . , Xk) = −g jl 
∇e jα

(el, X2, . . . , Xk) .
(2.7.24)
For some purposes, it is useful to rewrite this as
(d∗α)(X2, . . . , Xk) = −

trg
12(∇α)

(X2, . . . , Xk) .
(2.7.25)
Here, ∇α ∈Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗kT∗M) and trg
12 means contracting the ﬁrst two tensor
indices of ∇α with g. The quantity trg
12(∇α) is called the divergence of α and is
denoted by divgα. In this terminology, we have
d∗α = −divgα .
(2.7.26)
In particular, for a 1-form α ∈Ω1(M), we obtain (Exercise 2.7.4)
divg(α) vg = d(g−1(α)⌟vg) .
(2.7.27)
♦
(b) Next, instead of (kT∗M, ⟨·, ·⟩, ∇), consider any Riemannian or Hermitean
vector bundle E with a ﬁbre metric ⟨·, ·⟩and a compatible connection ∇over a
pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g). As in the above special case, ⟨·, ·⟩and g induce
a natural L2-inner product on Γ ∞(E) via
⟨s1, s2⟩L2 :=

M
⟨s1, s2⟩vg .
(2.7.28)
If we endow T∗M with the natural ﬁbre metric given by g−1, then we may extend
⟨·, ·⟩L2 to an inner product on Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E) which we denote by the same symbol.

We deﬁne the formal adjoint ∇∗: Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E) →Γ ∞(E) of ∇by
⟨s, ∇∗ϕ⟩L2 = ⟨∇s, ϕ⟩L2 ,
for any s ∈Γ ∞(E) and ϕ ∈Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E).
Proposition 2.7.6 For any ϕ ∈Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E),
∇∗ϕ = −trg

Proof Let s ∈Γ ∞(E). For a given local frame {ei} and its dual coframe {ϑi}, decom-
pose
∇s = ϑi ⊗∇eis ,
ϕ = ϑ j ⊗ϕ(e j) ,
and calculate
⟨∇s, ϕ⟩= ⟨ϑi ⊗∇eis, ϑ j ⊗ϕ(e j)⟩= gi j⟨∇eis, ϕ(e j)⟩.
Since ∇is compatible with the ﬁbre metric, (2.6.2) implies
ei(⟨s, ϕ(e j)⟩) = ⟨∇eis, ϕ(e j)⟩+ ⟨s, ∇ei(ϕ(e j))⟩,
and, thus,
⟨∇s, ϕ⟩= gi j 

Deﬁning a 1-form β ∈Ω1(M) by β(X) := ⟨s, ϕ(X)⟩, where X ∈X(M), we obtain
gi j 
ei(⟨s, ϕ(e j)⟩) −⟨s, ϕ(∇ei e j)⟩

= gi j(∇eiβ)(e j) = divgβ .
Then, (2.7.27) implies
⟨∇s, ϕ⟩= d(g−1(β)⌟vg) −gi j⟨s, (∇eiϕ)(e j)⟩.
Integrating this identity with vg and using Stokes' Theorem, we ﬁnd
⟨∇s, ϕ⟩L2 = −⟨s, gi j(∇eiϕ)(e j)⟩L2 = −⟨s, trg
12(∇ϕ)⟩L2 .

Moreover, since ⟨∇∗∇s1, s2⟩L2 = ⟨∇s1, ∇s2⟩L2 = ⟨s1, ∇∗∇s2⟩L2 , the Bochner-
Laplace operator is formally self-adjoint.
(c) It is convenient to consider kT∗M as associated with the reduced bundle of
orthonormal frames O(M). Then, σ is induced from the basic representation of the
orthogonal group O(r, s) of the pseudo-Euclidean metric η on Rn. It acts on k(Rn)∗

Remark 2.7.9 (Contraction and exterior multiplication) Let V be a real vector space

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
for all ξ, ζ ∈V ∗, by the universal property of the exterior algebra, ι extends to
an algebra morphism ι : V ∗→End(V ). We denote the operation of exterior
multiplication with an element v ∈V by
ε(v)(α) := v ∧α
and note the following basic identity (Exercise 2.7.6):
ε(v)ι(ξ) + ι(ξ)ε(v) = ⟨ξ, v⟩· 1 .
(2.7.33)
Let {e j} be an orthonormal basis of V , let {ϑ j} be the dual basis and denote ε j :=

End(V ) by derivations on the exterior algebra,

In the last step, we have used that RΛ is a derivation which acts trivially on zero-forms.
Using (2.7.36) once again, we obtain
RΛ = Ri jklεiι jεkιl .
(2.7.38)
Now we are able to formulate the main result of the second part of this section.
Theorem 2.7.11 (Weitzenboeck Formula) Let α ∈Ωk(M). Then,
□α = ∇∗∇α + RΛ(α) .
(2.7.39)
Proof We choose an orthonormal local frame {ei} and the dual coframe {ϑi}. Using
Lemma 2.7.4, (2.2.47), (2.1.46) and and the ﬁrst equation in (2.2.44), we calculate

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Since the Levi-Civita connection is torsionless, we have ∇eie j −∇e jei = [ei, e j]
and, thus, by point 2 of Remark 1.5.12 and Eqs. (2.1.32) and (2.7.36),
□α = ∇∗∇α −η jlei

Clearly, the second term in the Weitzenboeck Formula may be analyzed in more
detail for every form degree k. To do so, recall the presentation of the Ricci tensor
in a local frame given by (2.3.27),
Ric(X, Y) = −ηi jg

R(X, ei)Y, e j

,
X, Y ∈X(M) .
(2.7.40)
Associated with the Ricci tensor, one has the Ricci mapping
Ric : TM →TM ,
Ric(X) := ηi jR(X, ei)e j .
(2.7.41)
Being an endomorphism of TM, the Ricci mapping naturally extends to a derivation
RicΛ of TM. In degree 2, it is common to denote this derivation by Ric ∧id. We
have
(Ric ∧id)(X, Y) := Ric(X) ∧Y + X ∧Ric(Y) .
Analogously,associatedwiththecurvatureendomorphismform,onehasthemapping
R : 2TM →2TM ,
X ∧Y →ηi jei ∧R(X, Y)e j .
(2.7.42)
In applications, the cases k = 1 and k = 2 are of special importance.
Corollary 2.7.12
1 For k = 1, the Weitzenboeck Formula (2.7.39) reads
□α = ∇∗∇α + α ◦Ric .
(2.7.43)
2 For k = 2, the Weitzenboeck Formula may be rewritten as follows:
□α = ∇∗∇α + α ◦(R + Ric ∧id) ,
(2.7.44)
where R is the mapping deﬁned by (2.7.42).
Proof 1. For k = 1, by (2.7.37), (2.7.36) and (2.7.41),

2. By a similar calculation as under point 1, using additionally the algebraic

RΛ(α)(ei, e j) = −Rkjαk

The proof of the following example is left to the reader (Exercise 2.7.5).
Example 2.7.13 For Sn, endowed with the canonical Riemannian metric, the map-
ping (2.7.42) is given by R = −id and the Ricci mapping reads Ric(X) = (n −1)X.
Using (2.7.38), one ﬁnds
RΛ = k(n −k) id
(2.7.45)
on k-forms.
♦
Combining the Weitzenboeck Formula with the theory of harmonic forms, one gets
insight into the relation between curvature and topology. Let us discuss a simple
application of this type. We will write Ric ≥0 if Ricm(X, X) ≥0 for all m ∈M and
all X ∈Tm M, and Ricm > 0 if Ricm(X, X) > 0 for all 0 ̸= X ∈Tm M.
Proposition 2.7.14 (Bochner) Let (M, g) be an n-dimensional compact connected
and oriented Riemannian manifold with Ric ≥0. Then, the following statements
hold.
1. Every harmonic 1-form α is parallel and fulﬁls Ric(g−1(α), g−1(α)) = 0.
2. If, additionally, Ricm > 0 for some point m ∈M, then all harmonic 1-forms are
trivial.
Proof 1. By formula (2.7.43), for any α ∈Ω1(M), we have
⟨□α, α⟩L2 =∥∇α ∥2
L2 +

M
Ric(g−1(α), g−1(α))vg .
If α is harmonic, then the left hand side vanishes. Since both terms on the right hand
side are non-negative, they must vanish, too.

176

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
2. Let α ∈Ω1(M) be harmonic. Then, it is parallel. Since, for any X ∈X(M),
∇X(∥α ∥) = X(∥α ∥) = 2⟨∇Xα, α⟩,
α has locally constant length. Thus, since M is connected, αm = 0 implies α = 0
everywhereand,therefore,theevaluationmappingα →αm isinjective.Alsobypoint
1, Ric(g−1(α), g−1(α)) = 0. Since Ricm > 0 for some point m ∈M, we conclude
αm = 0 and, by the injectivity of the evaluation mapping, α = 0.
■
From the above proof it is clear that the vector space of harmonic 1-forms has at most
dimension n. Combining this with point 1 of Remark 2.7.1 we get the following.
Corollary 2.7.15 Under the assumptions of Proposition 2.7.14 on (M, g), we have
1. If Ric ≥0, then b1(M) = dim H 1
dR(M) ≤n.
2. If, additionally, Ricm > 0 for some point m ∈M, then b1(M) = 0.
■
Example 2.7.16
1. Since for the torus b1(Tn) = n ̸= 0, we conclude that this manifold does not admit
a Riemanian metric with positive Ricci curvature.
2. Using (2.7.45), for Sn endowed with the canonical Riemannian metric, we get
RΛ(α) = k(n −k)α, and thus the Weitzenboeck Formula implies □> 0 for 0 <
k < n. Consequently, there are no nontrivial harmonic forms for 0 < k < n and
the Betti numbers of M vanish for all k ̸= 0, n.
♦
In the remainder of this section, we show that the Weitzenboeck Formula generalizes
in a straightforward way to the case of differential forms on M with values in a
Riemannian (or Hermitean) vector bundle E endowed with a ﬁbre metric ⟨·, ·⟩and a
compatible connection ∇. In this form, it will play a crucial role both for the study
of the instanton moduli space and for the investigation of stability of solutions to the
Yang-Mills equations.
Recall from point 2 of Remark 2.6.1 that, without loss of generality, we may
limit our attention to associated bundles E = P ×G F with ﬁbre metrics ⟨·, ·⟩
induced from G-invariant inner products ⟨·, ·⟩F on F. First, note that the ﬁbre
metric ⟨·, ·⟩induces a pairing Ωk(M, E) × Ωl(M, E) →Ωk+l(M) as follows.
Let α ∈Ωk(M, E) and β ∈Ωl(M, E). For any m ∈M, we choose a local frame
si : U →E, i = 1, . . . , dim F, on an open neighbourhood U ⊂M of m, decompose
α = αi ⊗si and β = β j ⊗s j, and deﬁne
(α ˙∧β)m := αi
m ˙∧β j
m ⟨si(m), s j(m)⟩.
(2.7.46)
Clearly, this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the local frame.
In particular, using the metric g on M and extending the Hodge-star on M to
Ωk(M, E) by putting ∗α := (∗αi) ⊗si, we obtain a pairing
Ωk(M, E) × Ωk(M, E) →Ωn(M) ,
(α, β) →α ˙∧∗β .
(2.7.47)

2.7 Hodge Theory. The Weitzenboeck Formula
177
The latter can be used to deﬁne an L2-inner product50 on Ωk(M, E),
⟨α, β⟩L2 :=

M
α ˙∧∗β .
(2.7.48)
Decomposing α = αIϑ I and β = βJϑ J with respect to a local orthonormal coframe
{ϑ I} in the bundle of k-forms on M, we have
α ˙∧∗β = ⟨αI, βJ⟩ϑ I ∧∗ϑ J = ηI J⟨αI, βJ⟩vg .
(2.7.49)
This shows that to the above pairing, there corresponds a natural inner product on
Ωk(M, E) given by the tensor product of the ﬁbre metric ⟨·, ·⟩with the ﬁbre metric
ηI J in Ωk(M). If ⟨·, ·⟩is positive deﬁnite and g is Riemannian, then this inner product
is positive deﬁnite.
Remark 2.7.17 Let ˜α ∈Ωk
σ,hor(P, F) and ˜β ∈Ωl
σ,hor(P, F) be the horizontal forms
correspondingtoα ∈Ωk(M, E)andβ ∈Ωl(M, E)accordingtoProposition1.2.12.
Then, one easily shows (Exercise 2.7.7)
˜α ˙∧˜β = π∗(α ˙∧β) .
(2.7.50)
♦
Next, recall the covariant exterior derivative dωα : Ωk(M, E) →Ωk+1(M, E) asso-
ciated with the connection form ω of ∇, cf. Deﬁnition 1.5.1. We deﬁne its dual
d∗
ωα : Ωk+1(M, E) →Ωk(M, E) in the sense of Hodge by
⟨α, d∗

of the Hodge-Laplacian, cf. (2.7.14),
□ω := dω ◦d∗

ω ◦dω : Ωk(M, E) →Ωk(M, E) .
(2.7.52)
Proposition 2.7.18 For α ∈Ωk(M, E),
d∗
ωα = (−1)n(k−1)+s+1 ∗dω ∗α .
(2.7.53)
Proof Using (2.7.50), (1.5.1) and the G-invariance of ⟨·, ·⟩F, for β ∈Ωk+1 (M, E),
we calculate
50Again, we must restrict ourselves to square-integrable forms. In particular, we may consider forms
with compact support.

Integrating this identity over M, using Stokes' Theorem, we obtain
⟨dωα, β⟩L2 = ⟨α, (−1)nk+s+1 ∗dω ∗β⟩L2 .
Comparing with (2.7.51), we read off the assertion.
■
As above, we need a uniﬁed description in terms of the Koszul calculus. For that
purpose, it will be convenient to view the space Ωk(M, E) as follows. Denote
T r
s = Rn⊗
r· · · ⊗Rn ⊗Rn∗⊗
s· · · ⊗Rn∗.
Consider the ﬁbre product51 O(M) ×M P over M with structure group O(k,l) × G
and the associated bundle with typical ﬁbre T r
s ⊗F,
Er,s = (O(M) ×M P) ×O(k,l)×G (T r
s ⊗F) ,
which is clearly isomorphic to the tensor product Tr
s(M) ⊗E of vector bundles. The
left actions of O(k,l) and G on T r
s and F are denoted by μ and σ, respectively.
By Remark 1.3.17, the Levi-Civita connection form ωo on O(M) and the gauge
connection form ω on P induce a connection form ωo + ω on O(M) ×M P, cf.
(1.3.16).52 As usual, we denote the induced covariant exterior derivative acting on
Ωk
(μ,σ),hor(O(M) ×M P, T r
s ⊗F) by D(ωo+ω), its counterpart acting on Ωk(M, Er,s)
by d(ωo+ω) and the corresponding covariant derivative acting on sections of Er,s by
∇(ωo+ω). By the general theory,
Dωo+ω ˜Φ = d ˜Φ +

μ′(ωo) ⊗idF + idT rs ⊗σ ′(ω)

◦˜Φ ,
(2.7.54)
cf. (1.4.2). Clearly, μ′(ωo) ⊗idF + idT rs ⊗σ ′(ω) must be viewed as a 1-form on
Q ×M P with values in End(T r
s ⊗F). It is obtained by differentiating the tensor
product representation μ ⊗σ. Moreover, Ωk
(μ,σ),hor(O(M) ×M P, T r
s ⊗F) may be
viewed as a subspace of
51Cf. Remark 1.1.9/2.
52For simplicity, we omit the canonical projections onto O(M) and P, respectively.

2.7 Hodge Theory. The Weitzenboeck Formula
179
HomO(k,l)×G(O(M) ×M P, T r
s+k ⊗F)
consisting of those elements whose last k covariant tensor indices are anti-symmetric.
By Proposition 1.2.12, the latter space in turn may be identiﬁed with Γ ∞(Er,s+k).
Elements of this space may be viewed as tensor ﬁelds of type (r, s + k) on M with
values in the associated bundle E. In particular, we get the following identiﬁcation:
Ωk(M, E) ∼= Ωk(M, E0,0) .
(2.7.55)
Now, the generalization of the Weitzenboeck Formula is straightforward. First, for
(r, s) = (0, 0), the action μ is trivial and hence (2.7.54) implies
d(ωo+ω)α = dωα ,
d∗
(ωo+ω)α = d∗
ωα ,
for any α ∈Ωk(M, E). This implies
□ω = □(ωo+ω) .
(2.7.56)

We note the following immediate consequence of (2.7.57):
dωα =
	
j
ϑ j ∧∇(ωo+ω)
e j
α ,
(2.7.59)
where {ϑ j} is the coframe dual to {e j}.
Proof To prove (2.7.57), it is enough to consider elements α = φ ⊗β, where φ ∈
Γ ∞(E) and β ∈Ωk(M). Then, again using that the action μ is trivial, for the left
hand side of (2.7.57) we get
dωα = dωφ ∧β + φ ⊗dβ .
To analyze the right hand side, we use the derivation property of the covariant deriv-
ative,

Xφ ⊗β + φ ⊗∇ωo

This, together with formula (2.2.49), implies the assertion.
The proof of (2.7.58) is analogous to the proof of (2.7.23). We replace d by dω
and use (2.7.59).
■
Now, by the same calculation as in the proof of Theorem 2.7.11, we obtain the
following Generalized Weitzenboeck Formula
□ωα =

∇(ω0+ω)∗∇(ω0+ω)α + η jlei


R∇(ω0+ω)(e j, ei)α

(2.7.60)
where R∇(ω0+ω) is the curvature endomorphism form of the connection ω0 + ω given
by (1.5.13). Here, it reads
R∇(ω0+ω)

where m ∈M, z ∈π−1(m) ⊂O(M) ×M P, X, Y ∈Tm M and X h and Y h are the
horizontal lifts of X and Y to z, respectively. Clearly, by the additivity of R∇(ω0+ω), the
second term on the right hand side of (2.7.60) is the sum of the Weitzenboeck cur-
vature operators for the representations μ and σ, respectively, cf. Deﬁnition 2.7.10.
This yields the following.

□ωα =

∇(ω0+ω)∗∇(ω0+ω)α + R∇ωo
(α) + R∇ω(α) .
(2.7.61)
■
As above, formula (2.7.61) may be analyzed degreewise. Clearly, the terms coming
from the Levi-Civita connection are identical with those in Corollary 2.7.12. Thus,
we obtain the following.
Corollary 2.7.21
1. For α ∈Ω1(M, E), the Weitzenboeck Formula (2.7.61) reads
□ωα =

∇(ω0+ω)∗∇(ω0+ω)α + α ◦Ric + R∇ω(α) .
(2.7.62)
2. For α ∈Ω2(M, E), formula (2.7.61) may be rewritten as follows:
□ωα =

∇(ω0+ω)∗∇(ω0+ω)α + α ◦(R + Ric ∧id) + R∇ω(α) .
(2.7.63)
■
The Generalized Weitenboeck Formula will be taken up again in Example 5.6.7.
There, it will be discussed from the point of view of Dirac operator theory. It will
play a basic role in the analysis of the stability of Yang-Mills connections.

Four-Dimensional Riemannian Geometry. Self-duality
In this section, we deal with 4-dimensional (oriented) Riemannian manifolds. We
will show that, in contrast to other dimensions, they admit a rich additional structure.
Let us explain the reason for that. Given an oriented Riemannian manifold (M, g),
we know from Sect.2.4 that g yields a reduction of the frame bundle L(M) to the
principal SO(4)-bundle O+(M) of oriented orthonormal frames. Correspondingly,
all tensor bundles over M become associated with O+(M) with their typical ﬁbres
carrying representations of SO(4). Now, among all rotation groups, SO(4) is the
unique group which is not simple. This has striking consequences, as we will see
below. Recall from Example I/5.1.10 the isomorphism
Sp(1) →SU(2) ,
a = z + j w →
z −w

,
(2.8.1)
wherewehaveidentiﬁedCwithspan{1, i} ⊂HandHwithC2 bywritingquaternions

Sp(1) × Sp(1) are the universal (two-fold) covering groups53 of SO(3) and SO(4),
respectively. Denoting by ι : Sp(1) →Sp(1) × Sp(1) the diagonal embedding, we
have the following commutative diagram

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
This fact reduces the representation theory of SO(4) to that of Sp(1). By the isomor-
phism Sp(1) ∼= SU(2), we are led to consider complex representations built from the
basic representation of SU(2) on V ∼= C2. By a standard theorem in representation
theory [689], up to isomorphisms, the set of irreducible complex SU(2)-modules is

SrV : r ≥0

,
where SrV denotes the subspace of ⊗rV of totally symmetric tensors. Equivalently,
this subspace may be identiﬁed with the space of homogeneous polynomials of
degree r in two variables. Thus, dimC(SrV ) = r + 1. Moreover,
S pV ⊗SqV ∼=
min(p,q)

r=0
S p+q−2r V .
(2.8.3)
Note that S2V is the (complexiﬁed) adjoint representation space.
Now, any complex SO(4)-module (W, σ) may be viewed as an (Sp(1) × Sp(1))-
module via the mapping
σ ◦f :
Sp(1) × Sp(1) →Aut(W) .
Let us denote the basic representation spaces corresponding to the ﬁrst and the
second factor in Sp(1) × Sp(1), respectively, by V+ and V−. Then, again, by standard
representation theory, the irreducible complex (Sp(1) × Sp(1))-modules are given
by
S p,q = S pV+ ⊗SqV−,
p, q ≥0 .
(2.8.4)
Clearly, an irreducible representation Sp(1) × Sp(1) →Aut(S p,q) factors through
the covering homomorphism f , giving a representation of SO(4), iff p + q is even.
Moreover, in that case, S p,q is the complexiﬁcation of a real representation which
we denote by S p,q
r
. It is common to call S p,q
r
the real representation underlying S p,q.
Also note that
dimC(S p,q) = dimR(S p,q
r
) = (p + 1)(q + 1) .
In particular, the basic complex SO(4)-module is S1,1 = V+ ⊗V−. We denote T :=
S1,1
r
and write T ∗for the dual (contragredient) representation space. Clearly, we may
use the Euclidean metric on T to identify T ∼= T ∗. Now, calculating (Exercise 2.8.1)

representationspaceofSO(4)with (2.8.5)correspondingtotheLiealgebradecompo-

Next, we will relate the above decompositions to the Hodge star operator. Thus,
let ∗: rT ∗→4−rT ∗be the Hodge star operator with respect to the Euclidean
metric on T . By Proposition I/4.5.3,
∗◦∗= id2T ∗,
(2.8.7)
that is, on two-forms, the Hodge star operator is an involution. Thus, we may decom-
pose 2T ∗into an orthogonal direct sum of eigenspaces of ∗corresponding to the
eigenvalues ±1,
2T ∗= 2

−T ∗.
(2.8.8)
Elements of 2
+T ∗are called self-dual and elements of 2
−T ∗are called anti-self-
dual. Since the Hodge star operator is invariant under the action of SO(4), the sub-
spaces 2

Comparison of the decompositions (2.8.8) with (2.2.16) yields the following deep
insight. Let T ∗be endowed with the complex structure54
J =

J1 0

where J1 is the standard complex structure on R2. With respect to this structure, the
decomposition (2.2.16) reads

C .
(2.8.12)
As already noted, the left hand side may be identiﬁed with the Lie algebra o(4, C).
In analogy to (2.2.22), J induces an embedding U(2) ⊂SO(4) and the summands on
the right hand side of (2.8.12) carry representations of U(2). Observe that the almost
symplectic form β deﬁned by (2.2.26) belongs to 1,1T ∗
C and is U(2)-invariant.
Thus, we have an orthogonal decomposition
1,1T ∗
C = C ⊕1,1

into U(2)-irreducible components. By dimension counting, 1,1

C ∼= sl(2, C) (the

of the Lie algebra decomposition o(4) = R ⊕su(2) ⊕m, cf. point 3 of Example
2.5.27.

obtained by combining the standard complex structure J0 on R4 with the transformation deﬁned by

S2V+ ⊗S2V+ and thus has complex dimension 6. By (2.8.3),
S2V+ ⊗S2V+ = S4V+ ⊕S2V+ ⊕S0V+ .

Linear Connections and Riemannian Geometry
Now, we can apply the above results to the 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold
(M, g). By Proposition I/4.5.3, the Hodge star operator is an isometric involution on
the bundle of two forms, that is, ∗: 2T∗M →2T∗M fulﬁls
∗◦∗= id2T∗M ,
⟨∗α, ∗β⟩L2 = ⟨α, β⟩L2 ,
(2.8.16)
and, corresponding to (2.8.8), we have the splitting
2T∗M = 2
+T∗M ⊕2
−T∗M .
(2.8.17)
Clearly, the decomposition (2.8.17) implies a decomposition of 2-forms on M,
Ω2(M) = Ω2
+(M) ⊕Ω2
−(M) .
(2.8.18)
Thus, any α ∈Ω2(M) may be decomposed as follows:
α = α+ + α−,
∗α+ = α+ ,
∗α−= −α−,
(2.8.19)
where α± = 1
2(α ± ∗α). Elements of Ω2
+(M) are called self-dual and elements of
Ω2
−(M) are called anti-self-dual 2-forms. Finally, for a local oriented orthonormal
frame ϑ1, . . . , ϑ4 in 1T∗M, the subbundles 2
±T∗M are locally spanned by {ϕi
±}
given by the same formulae as in Remark 2.8.1/2.
Next, let us consider the Riemann curvature endomorphism form
R ∈Ω2(M, End(TM))
of (M, g). By Remark 2.3.7, pointwise, it may be viewed as a symmetric endomor-
phism of 2T∗

We wish to derive the counterpart of the general decomposition formula (2.3.21) for
n = 4. Here, according to the additional structures at a our disposal, this can be done
in two different ways. First, using (2.8.17), we can write
R(m) =

BT C

where Sc denotes the scalar curvature of ∇.

Remark 2.8.6 We show that the decomposition (2.8.22) corresponds to the decom-
position of S2(2T ∗) into irreducible components of SO(4) given by Lemma 2.8.4,
with one of the two S0,0 ∼= R-summands removed. For that purpose, we choose an
orthonormal basis in Tm M and use it to identify Tm M with T . Using (2.8.15), we
obtain

The statements of the following remark are left as an exercise to the reader

Deﬁnition 2.8.9 An oriented Riemannian 4-manifold is called self-dual or anti-self-

1. The manifolds S4, S1 × S3 and T4, endowed with their natural metrics, have a

sequence from the exact homotopy sequence of a pair. This yields, in particular, an
exact sequence for ﬁbre bundles containing the homotopy groups of the typical ﬁbre,
the total space and the base space.
Then, we solve the classiﬁcation problem of principal bundles with a given struc-
ture group and a given base manifold up to vertical isomorphisms. This is accom-
plished in three steps. First, in Sect.3.3, we prove the Covering Homotopy Theorem,
which implies that the pullbacks of a given topological principal G-bundle under
homotopic mappings are vertically isomorphic. This leads to the idea of classifying
topological principal G-bundles in terms of homotopy classes of mappings to the
base space of a universal principal G-bundle. Following this idea, in Sects.3.4 and
3.5 we prove that there exists a universal topological principal G-bundle for every
Lie group G. Finally, in Sect.3.6, we prove that the smooth vertical isomorphism
classes of smooth principal G-bundles over a manifold M are in bijective correspon-
dence with the continuous isomorphism classes of topological principal G-bundles
over M. A posteriori, this gives the justiﬁcation for classifying topological principal
bundles ﬁrst.
In the ﬁnal section, we discuss connections which are n-universal in the sense
that, via pullback, they can produce every connection on a principal G-bundle over
a manifold of dimension ≤n. We give both the explicit description in terms of the
natural connections on the Stiefel bundles and the more abstract description in terms
of the tautological connection on the section jet bundle of an n-universal principal
G-bundle.

Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
3.1
Basics
To make the topological concept of homotopy fruitful for the theory of principal
bundles, we have to work with topological principal bundles. The deﬁnition of topo-
logical principal G-bundle is obtained from Deﬁnition 1.1.1 in the obvious way, that
is, by requiring P and M to be topological spaces, G to be a topological group, the
action Ψ to be free and continuous, the projection π : P →M to be continuous and
the local trivializations χ : π−1(U) →U × G to be equivariant homeomorphisms
projecting to the identical mapping. Analogously, the deﬁnition of smooth ﬁbre bun-
dle translates into the deﬁnition of topological ﬁbre bundle. Sections in these bundles
are assumed to be continuous if not otherwise stated. The basic results about smooth
principal bundles discussed in Chap.1 translate in an obvious way to topological
principal bundles. In particular, we will need the following.
1. Associated bundles constructed by means of topological group actions are topo-
logical ﬁbre bundles.
2. Every vertical G-morphism is an isomorphism (Remark 1.1.8/2).
3. The pullback of a topological principal G-bundle by a continuous mapping is a
topological principal G-bundle (Remark 1.1.9/1). Moreover, f ∗(g∗P) is verti-
cally isomorphic to (g ◦f )∗P.
4. If ϑ : Q →P is a G-morphism of principal bundles with projection ˜ϑ, then the
mapping
Q →˜ϑ∗P,
q →

πQ(q), ϑ(q)

,
is a vertical isomorphism and ϑ decomposes into the composition of this iso-
morphism with the natural principal G-bundle morphism ˜ϑ∗P →P (Remark
1.1.9/1).
5. G-bundle morphisms P →Q are in bijective correspondence with sections in
P ×G Q (Proposition 1.2.6). If P and Q have the same base space, then vertical
G-bundle morphisms P →Q are in bijective correspondence with sections in
P ×G,M Q (Corollary 1.2.7).
6. If H ⊂G is a closed subgroup, the action of G on P restricts to an action of H and
the latter makes P into a principal H-bundle over the topological quotient P/H.
The induced projection P/H →M is a topological ﬁbre bundle with typical ﬁbre
G/H (Example 1.2.4/1).
In this and in the next chapter, topological spaces will usually be denoted by X, Y, Z
etc. Continuous mappings X →Y will be denoted by f , g, h etc. and their totality
will be denoted by C(X, Y) ≡C0(X, Y). The set of homotopy classes of continuous
mappings X →Y will be denoted by [X, Y]. That is, [X, Y] = C(X, Y)/ ∼, where
∼refers to the equivalence relation of being homotopic. Every continuous mapping
g : Y →Z induces a mapping g∗: [X, Y] →[X, Z] by
g∗([ f ]) := [g ◦f ].
(3.1.1)

3.1 Basics
191
Recall that a pointed topological space is a topological space X together with a
point ∗X. A mapping f : X →Y of pointed spaces is pointed if f (∗X) = ∗Y. The
subset of continuous pointed mappings will be denoted by C∗(X, Y) ⊂C(X, Y).
A pointed homotopy is a homotopy through pointed mappings. The set of pointed
homotopy classes of pointed mappings X →Y will be denoted by [X, Y]∗. Every
pointed continuous mapping g : Y →Z induces a mapping g∗: [X, Y]∗→[X, Z]∗
given by (3.1.1).
Recall further that a topological pair (X, A) is a topological space X together
with a subset A endowed with the relative topology. A pair mapping (X, A) →
(Y, B) is a mapping f : X →Y satisfying f (A) ⊂B. The subset of continuous
pair mappings will be denoted by C

(X, A), (Y, B)

⊂C(X, Y). A pair homo-
topy is a homotopy through pair mappings. The set of pair homotopy classes of
pair mappings (X, A) →(Y, B) will be denoted by [(X, A), (Y, B)]. A pointed
pair is a pair (X, A) with base point in A. The subset of continuous pointed
pair mappings will be denoted by C∗

(X, A), (Y, B)

⊂C

(X, A), (Y, B)

and the
set of pointed pair homotopy classes of pointed pair mappings (X, A) →(Y, B)
will be denoted by [(X, A), (Y, B)]∗. Every pair mapping (pointed pair mapping)
g : (Y, B) →(Z, C) induces a mapping g∗: [(X, A), (Y, B)] →[(X, A), (Z, C)]
(g∗: [(X, A), (Y, B)]∗→[(X, A), (Z, C)]∗) given by (3.1.1).
Let I = [0, 1]. Recall that homotopies f, g : X × I →Y which satisfy f (x, 1) =
g(x, 0) for all x ∈X can be concatenated and that their concatenation is usually
deﬁned to be the homotopy
f · g : X × I →Y,
( f · g)(x, t) :=

f (x, 2t)
| t ≤1
2,
g(x, 2t −1) | t > 1
2.
(3.1.2)
The concatenation of pointed homotopies, pair homotopies or pointed pair homo-
topies is, respectively, a pointed homotopy, a pair homotopy or a pointed pair homo-
topy. In the special case where X is the one-point space, (3.1.2) boils down to the
concatenation of curves γ, δ : I →Y satisfying γ (1) = δ(0), cf. formula (1.7.1).
Finally, recall the homotopy groups of a pointed topological space X,
πn(X) := [(I n, ∂I n), (X, {∗X})]∗,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
with the origin 0 as the base point of (I n, ∂I n). In case n = 0, we put I 0 = {0, 1} and
∂I 0 = ∅. Thus, π0(X) is the set of pathwise connected components of X. In case n ≥
1, the set πn(X) carries a group structure with multiplication deﬁned by concatenation
(3.1.2), where the mappings I k →X are viewed as homotopies I k−1 × I →X. In
case n ≥2, the multiplication is Abelian. Alternatively, since I n/∂I n is homotopic to
Sn, the elements of πn(X) can be viewed as (homotopy classes of) pointed mappings
Sn →X.
Accordingly, the relative homotopy groups of a pointed topological pair (X, A)
are deﬁned by

192
3
Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
πn(X, A) := [(I n, ∂I n), (X, A)]∗,
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Here, the multiplication is Abelian for n ≥3.
First, we discuss the compact-open topology on mapping spaces. Let X and Y be
Hausdorff spaces and assume X to be locally compact. The compact-open topology
on the space C(X, Y) of continuous mappings X →Y is generated by the subsets
M(K, O) = { f ∈C(X, Y) : f (K) ⊂O}
with K ⊂X compact and O ⊂Y open. These subsets form a subbasis, meaning that
the topology is generated by taking ﬁnite intersections and arbitrary unions. In case
X and Y are pointed, the compact-open topology on C∗(X, Y) is deﬁned likewise.
It coincides with the relative topology induced from C(X, Y). We will need the
following properties.
Proposition 3.1.1 Let X, Y and Z be Hausdorff spaces and assume X to be locally
compact.
1. C(X, Y) is Hausdorff.
2. The evaluation mapping C(X, Y) × X →Y, ( f, x) →f (x), is continuous.
3. A mapping f : X × Z →Y is continuous iff so are all the mappings fz : X →Y,
x →f (x, z), with z ∈Z and the mapping Z →C(X, Y), z →fz.
4. Let prY : Y × Z →Y and prZ : Y × Z →Z denote the natural projections. The
mappingC(X, Y × Z) →C(X, Y) × C(X, Z)deﬁnedby f →(prY ◦f, prZ ◦f )
is a homeomorphism.
Similar statements hold in the pointed case.
Proof 1. Let f and g be two distinct elements of C(X, Y). There exists x ∈X such
that f (x) ̸= g(x). Since Y is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open neighbourhoods
U1 of f (x) and U2 of g(x). Then, f −1(U1) ∩g−1(U2) is an open neighbourhood
of x, because f and g are continuous. Since X is locally compact, this neighbour-
hood contains a compact neighbourhood K. Then, M(K,U1) and M(K,U2) are
neighbourhoods of f and g, respectively. They are disjoint, because U1 and U2 are
disjoint.
2. We have to show that for every open subset O ⊂Y, the subset
˜O = {( f, x) ∈C(X, Y) × X : f (x) ∈O}
of C(X, Y) × X is open in the product topology. Let ( f0, x0) ∈˜O. Then, x0 ∈
f −1
0 (O). Since f0 is continuous, f −1
0 (O) is an open neighbourhood of x0. Since
X is locally compact, f −1
0 (O) contains a compact neighbourhood K of x0. Then,
M(K, O) × K is a neighbourhood of ( f0, x0) which is contained in ˜O. Therefore,
˜O is open.

3.1 Basics
193
3. First, assume that f is continuous. For given z ∈Z, the mapping fz is continu-
ous, because it arises by composing f with the mapping X →X × Z, x →(x, z),
whose continuity is immediate from the deﬁnition of the product topology. To prove
that the mapping z →fz is continuous, denote this mapping by ϕ. Since taking
preimages commutes with taking intersections or unions, it sufﬁces to show that
ϕ−1
M(K, O)

is open for all compact K ⊂X and all open O ⊂Y. Thus, let K
and O be given and let z ∈ϕ−1
M(K, O)

. Then, f (K × {z}) ⊂O. By continuity
of f , for every x ∈K, there exist open neighbourhoods Ux of x in X and Vx of z
in Z such that f (Ux × Vx) ⊂O. Since K is compact, we can ﬁnd x1, . . . , xr such
that K ⊂r
i=1 Uxi. Then, V := r
i=1 Vxi is an open neighbourhood of z satisfying
f (K × V ) ⊂O, that is, V ⊂ϕ−1
M(K, O)

. Therefore, ϕ−1
M(K, O)

is open,
as asserted.
The converse implication follows by observing that f can be written as the compo-
sition of the mapping X × Z →C(X, Y) × X, (x, z) →( fz, x) with the evaluation

4. Denote the mapping under consideration by ϕ. Obviously, ϕ is bijective
with inverse ( f, g) →( f × g) ◦ΔX, where ΔX : X →X × X denotes the diag-

To prove that ϕ is continuous and open, since application of ϕ−1 and ϕ com-
mutes with taking intersections or unions, it sufﬁces to show that the subsets

Point 3 of Proposition 3.1.1 implies the following.
Corollary 3.1.2 Let X and Y be Hausdorff spaces and assume X to be locally
compact. A mapping f : X × I →Y is a homotopy iff the mapping t →ft is a
continuous curve in C(X, Y). In particular, [X, Y] coincides with the set of pathwise
connected components of C(X, Y). In case X and Y are pointed, [X, Y]∗coincides
with the set of pathwise connected components of C∗(X, Y).
■
Under the correspondence of homotopies on X with values in Y with continuous
curves in C(X, Y), the concatenation of homotopies corresponds to the concatenation
of curves. Together with point 4 of Proposition 3.1.1, this implies the following.
Corollary 3.1.3 Let X, Y and Z be Hausdorff spaces and assume X to be locally
compact. Let prY : Y × Z →Y and prZ : Y × Z →Z denote the natural projec-
tions. The mapping [X, Y × Z] →[X, Y] × [X, Z] deﬁned by

is a bijection. A similar statement holds in the pointed case.
■
Next, we discuss loop spaces and their homotopy groups. The loop space of a pointed
Hausdorff space X is the mapping space
Ω X := C

(I, ∂I), (X, {∗})

endowed with the compact-open topology induced from C(I, X). By Proposition
3.1.1/1, Ω X is Hausdorff. It is pointed with base point given by the constant loop at
∗∈X. Thus, for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , we can consider the space of pointed pair mappings
C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

. For n ≥1, we may identify I n = I n−1 × I and thus view
the elements of this space as homotopies. As such, any two of them can be con-
catenated. Hence, through this identiﬁcation, concatenation of homotopies deﬁnes
an operation on C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

. This operation descends to the ordinary
multiplication in πn(Ω X) = [(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})]∗. We will therefore refer to this
operation as ordinary concatenation.
On the other hand, one can check that the operation of concatenation in Ω X,
given by (1.7.1), is continuous (Exercise 3.1.2). Hence, by pointwise application, it
induces an operation ⊙in C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

,
f ⊙g : I n →Ω X,
( f ⊙g)(t) := f (t) · g(t).
(3.1.3)
We will refer to this operation as pointwise concatenation. One can further check
that loop inversion γ →γ −1 deﬁnes a continuous mapping Ω X →Ω X (Exercise
3.1.2). Hence, for every f ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

, the mapping f −⊙: I n →
Ω X deﬁned by f −⊙(t) = f (t)−1 (inverse loop) is continuous and hence an element
of C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

.
The following lemma collects the homotopy properties of the operation of point-
wise concatenation. The proof is analogous to that for ordinary concatenation and is
therefore left to the reader.
Lemma 3.1.4 Let n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , let X be a pointed Hausdorff space and let
f, g, h, k ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

. Let ∼denote the equivalence relation of
being pointed homotopic and let e ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

be deﬁned by assign-
ing to every t ∈I n the constant loop at ∗.
1. If f ∼h and g ∼k, then f ⊙g ∼h ⊙k and f −⊙∼h−⊙.
2. ( f ⊙g) ⊙h ∼f ⊙(g ⊙h).
3.
f ⊙e ∼e ⊙f ∼f .
4.
f −⊙⊙f ∼f ⊙f −⊙∼e.
■
By an elementary calculation, one ﬁnds that for n ≥1, pointwise concatenation and
ordinary concatenation are related by
( f ⊙g) · (h ⊙k) = ( f · h) ⊙(g · k).
(3.1.4)

Theorem 3.1.5 Let X be a pointed Hausdorff space and let n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
1. The operation of pointwise concatenation in C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

induces
a group operation in πn(Ω X) ≡[(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})]∗. For n ≥1, the latter
operation coincides with that induced by ordinary concatenation.
2. The group πn(Ω X) is isomorphic to πn+1(X). An isomorphism is induced by
the mapping C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

→C∗

(I n+1, ∂I n+1), (X, {∗})

, f →˜f ,
where ˜f (t, t) := f (t)(t) for all t ∈I n and t ∈I.
According to point 1, the operation of pointwise concatenation provides an alternative
view on the homotopy groups of the loop space Ω X and, in addition, a natural group
operation on π0(Ω X).
Proof 1. That ⊙induces a group operation on πn(Ω X) for all n ≥0 follows from
Lemma 3.1.4. In case n ≥1, using this lemma, (3.1.4) and the homotopy properties
of ordinary concatenation, we ﬁnd
f ⊙g ∼( f · e) ⊙(e · g) = ( f ⊙e) · (e ⊙g) ∼f · g.
Hence, the operations induced on [(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})]∗coincide.
2.ByProposition3.1.1/3, ˜f iscontinuousforevery f .Hence,themapping f →˜f
is well deﬁned. It is easy to see that this mapping is bijective.
To check that f ∼g iff ˜f ∼˜g, according to Corollary 3.1.2, it sufﬁces to show
that a curve γ in C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

is continuous iff so is the corresponding
curve ˜γ in C∗

(I n+1, ∂I n+1), (X, {∗})

. Applying Proposition 3.1.1/3 twice, we ﬁnd
that γ is continuous iff so is the mapping
I n × I × I →X,
(t, t, s) →

γ (s)(t)

(t).
Since

γ (s)(t)

(t) =

˜γ (s)

(t, t), this mapping is continuous iff so is the mapping
I n+1 × I →X,
(t ′, s) →

˜γ (s)

(t ′).
Applying Proposition 3.1.1/3 once again, we ﬁnd that the latter holds iff ˜γ is continu-
ous. As a result, the mapping f →˜f descends to a bijection πn(Ω X) →πn+1(X).
It remains to check that the latter is a group homomorphism. For that purpose, it
sufﬁces to check that ( f ⊙g)∼= ˜f · ˜g for all f , g. We leave this to the reader. ■
Remark 3.1.6 By Lemma 3.1.4 and formula (3.1.4), one ﬁnds
f ⊙g ∼(e · f ) ⊙(g · e) = (e ⊙g) · ( f ⊙e) ∼g · f ∼g ⊙f
for all f, g ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Ω X, {∗})

. Hence, the group operation on πn(Ω X)
inherited from pointwise concatenation is Abelian. As a consequence, Theorem 3.1.5
implies that the homotopy groups πn(X) of a pointed Hausdorff space X are Abelian
for n ≥2. This is in fact the standard argument used in textbooks, cf. [104].

Next, we discuss CW-complexes. Recall that the direct sum of a family of topological
spaces {Xα : α ∈A} is given by the disjoint union 
α∈A Xα endowed with the ﬁnal
topology1 deﬁned by the natural inclusion mappings Xα →
α∈A Xα.
Deﬁnition 3.1.7 Let X be a set and let r0,r1,r2, . . . be a sequence of non-negative
integers. A CW-structure on X with rn cells in dimension n is a family F of map-
pings f n
i : Dn →X, where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . and i = 1, . . . ,rn wheneverrn > 0, such
that the following conditions hold. Let X(n) denote the union of the images of the
mappings f k
i with k ≤n.
1. For every n with rn ̸= 0, rn
i=1 f n
i maps rn
i=1(Int Dn) injectively to X \ X(n−1).2
2. Every f n
i maps ∂Dn to X(n−1).
3. X = 
n X(n).
A CW-complex is a Hausdorff topological space X together with a CW-structure F
on the underlying set such that the topology of X coincides with the ﬁnal topology
deﬁned by F.
The mappings f n
i are referred to as the characteristic mappings and their restrictions
to ∂Dn ⊂Dn as the attaching mappings of the CW-structure F. The images f n
i (Dn)
are referred to as the closed cells and the subsets f n
i (Int Dn) as the open cells of
F. The subsets X(n) ⊂X are called the n-skeleta of F. A CW-complex (X, F) is
said to be ﬁnite if only ﬁnitely many of the numbers rn are nonzero. In this case, the
largest n such that rn ̸= 0 is called the dimension. The CW-complex (X, F) is said
to be pointed if X is pointed and the base point is a 0-cell. A subcomplex of (X, F)
is a subspace ˜X ⊂X endowed with the relative topology, together with a subfamily
˜
F ⊂F such that ( ˜X, ˜
F) is a CW-complex.
Remark 3.1.8 The acronym CW refers to the following properties.
1. Closure-ﬁniteness: every closed cell meets only ﬁnitely many open cells (because
by the deﬁning property 1, it can meet only open cells of lower dimension and
these are ﬁnite in number).
2. Weak topology: X carries the ﬁnal topology deﬁned by the family F. Thus, a
subset of X is open iff all of its preimages under the mappings f n
i are open.
An analogous statement holds for closed subsets. Since Dn is compact and X is
Hausdorff, the latter is equivalent to the statement that a subset of X is closed iff
its intersection with every closed cell is closed.
♦
Proposition 3.1.9 Let X be a Hausdorff topological space and let F be a ﬁnite
CW-structure on X. For that F makes X into a CW-complex it sufﬁces that every
f n
i ∈F is continuous.
1The ﬁnal topology deﬁned on X by a family of mappings fα : Xα →X is the ﬁnest topology in
which all fα are continuous. That is, a subset A ⊂X is open iff f −1
α (A) ⊂Xα is open for all α.
2For n = 0, we put Int D0 = D0 and X(−1) = ∅.

3.1 Basics
197
Proof We show that a subset A ⊂X is closed iff ( f n
i )−1(A) ⊂Dn is closed for all
n and i. The 'only if' direction is obvious. To prove the 'if' direction, assume that
( f n
i )−1(A) is closed for all n and i. Since a continuous mapping from a compact space
to a Hausdorff space is closed (Exercise 3.1.1), it follows that f n
i

( f n
i )−1(A)

⊂X
is closed for all n and i. Since A is the union over all these subsets, and since their
number is ﬁnite, we conclude that A is closed.
■
Example 3.1.10 Proofs are left to the reader (Exercise 3.1.3).
1. The n-sphere Sn admits a CW-structure with one cell in dimension 0 and one cell
in dimension n. The characteristic mappings can be chosen as
f 0(∗) = e1,
f n(x) = (2x 2 −1, 2
	
1 −x 2x).
There is another CW-structure, with two cells in each dimension up to n. Its
characteristic mappings can be chosen as
f 0
±(∗) = ±e1,
f k
±(x) = (x, ±
	
1 −x 2, 0, . . . , 0).
(3.1.5)
Correspondingly, the two closed cells in dimension k are given by
{(x1, . . . , xk+1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈Sn : ±xk+1 ≥0}.
This CW-structure has the advantage that the lower dimensional spheres
Sk = {(x1, . . . , xk+1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈Sn},
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1,
are subcomplexes.
2. The closed n-disk Dn has a tautological CW-structure with one cell in dimension n
and the identical mapping as the characteristic mapping. It is however sometimes
convenient to have the boundary Sn−1 as a subcomplex. This can be achieved by
just adding either one of the two CW-structures of Sn−1 of point 1, with Sn−1
being viewed as a subset of Dn and the characteristic mappings as mappings to
Dn.
3. The one-point union3 of two pointed CW-complexes (X1, F1) and (X2, F2)
is a CW-complex with underlying space X1 ∨X2 and CW-structure F1 ∪F2,
where the elements of Fi are viewed as mappings to X1 ∨X2 via the natural
inclusion mappings Xi →X1 ∨X2. This way, the characteristic mappings of
the base points get identiﬁed and thus yield one element of F1 ∪F2. As an
application, from the CW-structures on S1 we obtain CW-structures on the ﬁgure
eight and, more generally, on the one-point union of a ﬁnite number of 1-spheres.
However, one cannot obtain a CW-structure on the one-point union of a countably

the quotient of X ⊔Y by the subset {∗X, ∗Y }. It is pointed with base point [∗X] = [∗Y ].

inﬁnite number of copies, a space which is known as the Hawaiian earring, in this
way. In fact, this space does not admit any CW-structure.
4. The direct product of two CW-complexes (X1, F1) and (X2, F2) is a CW-
complex with underlying space X1 × X2 and CW-structure F1 × F2 with ele-
ments ( f n
1i × f m
2 j) ◦pn+m, where pn+m : Dn+m →Dn × Dm is some chosen
homeomorphism. This makes sense, because, as a homeomorphism, pn+m maps
the boundary Sn+m−1 of Dn+m onto the boundary (Sn−1 × Dm) ∪(Dn × Sm−1) of
Dn × Dm. The number of cells of F1 × F2 in dimension n is
n

k=0
r1,k r2,n−k.
For example, the direct product of two copies of the CW-complex S1 with one cell
in dimensions 0 and 1 yields a CW-structure on the 2-torus T2 = S1 × S1 with
one cell in dimensions 0 and 2 and two cells in dimension 1. This CW-structure
coincides with the one obtained by means of Morse theory in Example 8.9.9 of
Part I.
5. Let (X, F) be a CW-complex and let G be a ﬁnite group acting freely on X by
homeomorphisms. If one can deﬁne a free action of G on F by permutations of
characteristic mappings of the same dimension such that
(a · f n
i )(x) = a ·

f n
i (x)

for all a ∈G and x ∈D, then by choosing one representative in each G-orbit in F
and composing it with the natural projection onto the quotient, one obtains a CW-
structure on that quotient. For example, consider the action of the cyclic group
G = Z2 of order two on Sn generated by the antipodal mapping. The quotient
of this action is the real projective space RPn. One can deﬁne a free action of
Z2 on the CW-structure with two cells in each dimension up to n, cf. point 5, by
exchanging cells of the same dimension. By choosing one cell in each dimension,
f k
+ say, and composing it with the natural projection Sn →RPn we obtain a
CW-structure on RPn with one cell in each dimension.
♦
Proposition 3.1.11 Let (X, F) be a CW-complex, let Y be a topological space and
let f : X →Y be a mapping. The following statements are equivalent.
1. The mapping f is continuous.
2. The mappings f ◦f n
i are continuous for all n and i.
3. The restrictions of f to the closed cells of F are continuous.
Proof The implication 1 ⇒3 is obvious.
3 ⇒2. Let n and i be given. Since f n
i is continuous, so is its restriction in range
to the closed cell f n
i (Dn). Composition of the latter with the restriction of f in
domain to that closed cell yields f ◦f n
i .
2 ⇒1. Let A ⊂Y be open. By assumption, then ( f ◦f n
i )−1(A) is open in Dn for
all n and i. Since ( f ◦f n
i )−1(A) = ( f n
i )−1

Proposition 3.1.12 Let (X, F) be a CW-complex, let Y be a topological space and
let fn : X(n) →Y, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , be a family of continuous mappings satisfying
fn+1↾X(n) = fn for all n. Then, there exists a unique mapping f : X →Y such that
f↾X(n) = fn for all n and this mapping is continuous.
Proof Since the assumption implies that fm↾X(n) = fn for all m > n, and since X
is the union over the n-skeleta, we can deﬁne f by f↾X(n) = fn. Uniqueness is then
obvious. To check continuity, we observe that for all n, i and x ∈Dn, we have
f

is continuous for all n and i and
hence, by Proposition 3.1.11/2, that f is continuous.

Using Morse theory, one can show the following, cf. the discussion for compact
manifolds on page 420 in Part I.
Proposition 3.1.13 Every smooth manifold M is homotopy equivalent to a CW-
complex of the same dimension.
Proof See [449, p. 36].
■
Finally, we discuss direct limits. A directed system of topological spaces consists
of a directed set4 (A, ≤), a topological space Xα for every α ∈A and a continuous
mapping fαβ : Xα →Xβ for every pair (α, β) ∈A × A with α ≤β such that fαα =
idXα for all α and fβγ ◦fαβ = fαγ for all α ≤β ≤γ . The direct limit
X = lim
→Xα
of a directed system {Xα, fαβ} is the topological quotient of the direct sum 
α∈A Xα
with respect to the equivalence relation that x ∈Xα is equivalent to y ∈Xβ iff
fαγ (x) = fβγ (y) for some γ . Composition of the natural inclusion mappings
Xα →
α∈A Xα with the natural projection to equivalence classes yields contin-
uous mappings
ϕα : Xα →X
and the topology of X coincides with the ﬁnal topology deﬁned by these mappings.
That is, a subset of X is open iff its preimage under ϕα is open in Xα for every α.
The proofs of the following two propositions are left to the reader (Exercises 3.1.4
and 3.1.5).
Proposition 3.1.14 Let {Xα, fαβ} and {Yα, gαβ} be directed systems of topological
spaces over the same index set A and let X and Y, respectively, be the direct limits.
Every family of continuous mappings hα : Xα →Yα satisfying hβ ◦fαβ = gαβ ◦hα

Fibrations
In this section, let X, Y be topological spaces and let π : Y →X be a continuous
mapping. Given a topological space Z and a continuous mapping f : Z →X, every
continuous mapping ˜f : Z →Y satisfying
π ◦˜f = f
is called a lift of f through π. Let there be given a topological pair (Z, A), a contin-
uous mapping f : Z →X and a lift ˜f0 : A →Y of f↾A through π. The quest for an
extension of ˜f0 to a lift ˜f of f through π is called the lifting problem for π deﬁned
by the mapping f and the initial condition ˜f0. The situation can be summarized in

If for a certain class of topological pairs (Z, A) every lifting problem for π has a

Of particular interest is the special situation where the pair under consideration
is of the form (Z × I, Z × {0}). In this case, the lifting problem is referred to as the

If for a certain class of pointed topological spaces Z every homotopy lifting problem

to that class of spaces.
Deﬁnition 3.2.1 A continuous mapping π : Y →X is called a Hurewicz ﬁbration
if it has the homotopy lifting property with respect to all topological spaces. It is
called a Serre ﬁbration if it has the homotopy lifting property with respect to Dn for
all n.
Example 3.2.2
1. The natural projections in a direct product are Hurewicz ﬁbrations. Indeed, for
Y = X × F and the natural projection π : Y →X, the homotopy lifting problem
deﬁned by some mapping f : Z × I →X and an appropriate initial condition
˜f0 : Z × {0} →Y is solved by the mapping

2. Topological ﬁbre bundles are Serre ﬁbrations, see Corollary 3.2.5 below.
♦
In what follows, we ﬁrst collect the basic properties of Serre ﬁbrations. Then, we
prove that topological ﬁbre bundles are Serre ﬁbrations. Thereafter, we show that
the homotopy sequence for pairs induces a homotopy sequence for Serre ﬁbrations.
Finally, we discuss the path-loop ﬁbration of a topological space and pullbacks of
ﬁbrations.
Proposition 3.2.3 Serre ﬁbrations have the lifting property with respect to all pairs

deformation retract of K.
Proof Let π : Y →X be a Serre ﬁbration, let K be a CW-complex and let L be a
subcomplex of K.
1. Consider the lifting problem deﬁned by some f : K × I →X and an appro-
priate initial condition ˜f0 : (K × {0}) ∪(L × I) →Y. We prove the assertion by
induction on the dimension k of the cells attached to L to build K. Let K (k) denote
the k-skeleton of K. The case k = 0 is trivial. Thus, assume that we have constructed a
lift ˜f of f over the subspace (K (k) ∪L) × I ⊂K × I for some k ≥0 and consider
a (k + 1)-cell C not contained in L, with characteristic mapping χ : Dk+1 →K.
Since C is not contained in L, we have C ∩(K (k) ∪L) = C ∩K (k). Hence, we wish

˜f ◦

χ × idI

↾(Dk+1×{0})∪(∂Dk+1×I)
to a lift of f ◦(χ × idI

on Dk+1 × I. Since χ is injective on Int Dk+1, this lift
uniquely determines a lift of f on C × I. By Proposition 3.1.11, applied to the
CW-complex C × I, the latter is continuous.
This argument shows that in order to prove that ˜f extends to a lift of f over
(K (k+1) ∪L) × I, it sufﬁces to show that π has the lifting property with respect to
the pair

Dk+1 × I, (Dk+1 × {0}) ∪(∂Dk+1 × I)

. It is not hard to see that this pair
is homeomorphic to the pair (Dk+1 × I, Dk+1 × {0}) (Exercise 3.2.1). Since π is a
Serre ﬁbration, this yields the assertion.
2. Let F : K × I →K be a strong deformation retraction from K to L and
consider the lifting problem deﬁned by some f : K →X and an appropriate initial
condition ˜f0 : L →Y. Deﬁne g : K × I →X by g := f ◦F. Since F maps the
subsets K × {1} and L × I to L, we can also deﬁne
˜g0 : (K × {1}) ∪(L × I) →Y,
˜g0(x, t) := ˜f0

F(x, t)

.
A brief calculation shows that ˜g0 is a lift of g over the subset (K × {1}) ∪(L × I).
Hence, according to point 1, it can be extended to a lift ˜g of g. Then, another brief
calculation shows that the mapping ˜f : K →Y deﬁned by ˜f (x) := ˜g(x, 0) is a lift
of f through π extending ˜f0.
■
To be a Serre ﬁbration is a local property in the following sense.
Proposition 3.2.4 For a continuous mapping π : Y →X to be a Serre ﬁbration
it sufﬁces that every x ∈X admits a neighbourhood U such that the mapping
π−1(U) →U induced by restriction of π is a Serre ﬁbration.

3.2 Fibrations
203
Proof Consider the homotopy lifting problem deﬁned by some f : Dn × I →X
and some appropriate initial condition ˜f0 : Dn × {0} →Y. Since Dn × I is com-
pact, we can ﬁnd open subsets U1, . . . ,Ur of X such that the mappings π−1(Ui) →
Ui induced by restriction of π are Serre ﬁbrations and such that the preimages
f −1(Ui) cover Dn × I. We ﬁnd a cell complex structure of Dn and numbers
t1, . . . , ts ∈I such that for every cell C and every j = 0, . . . , s, there exists i such
that f (C × [t j, t j+1]) ⊂Ui. Here, t0 = 0 and ts+1 = 1. We prove the assertion by
induction on the dimension k of the cells and, for each ﬁxed cell, by induction on
j. The case k = 0 is trivial for all j. For a given cell C of dimension k ≥1 and
given j, via the characteristic mapping of C, the induction argument boils down to
solving a lifting problem for the Serre ﬁbration π−1(Ui) →Ui, deﬁned on the pair

C × [t j, t j+1], (C × {0}) ∪(∂C × I)

. Thus, the assertion follows from Proposi-
tion 3.2.3/1.
■
In view of Example 3.2.2/1, Proposition 3.2.4 implies
Corollary 3.2.5 Topological ﬁbre bundles are Serre ﬁbrations.
■
If the base space is assumed to be paracompact, one has the following stronger result,
originally proved independently in [322] and [332].
Proposition 3.2.6 (Huebsch and Hurewicz) Topological ﬁbre bundles over para-
compact base spaces are Hurewicz ﬁbrations.
Proof See [598, Theorem 2.7.13].
■
Now, we show that the homotopy sequence for pointed pairs induces a homotopy
sequence for Serre ﬁbrations. Let π : Y →X be a Serre ﬁbration. Let ∗X be a base
point in X, let F := π−1(∗X) and let ∗F be a base point in F. The latter will be taken
as a base point in Y, too. This way, π is turned into a pointed mapping. The subset
F is referred to as the ﬁbre of π. Recall that for the pointed pair (Y, F), one has the
following natural homomorphisms of homotopy groups:
1. the boundary homomorphism deﬁned by
∂: πn(Y, F) →πn−1(F),
∂[ f ] := [ f↾∂I n],
(3.2.3)
2. the homomorphism i∗: πn(Y) →πn(Y, F) induced from the natural inclusion
mapping (Y, {∗F}) →(Y, F),
3. the homomorphism j∗: πn(F) →πn(Y) induced from the natural inclusion map-
ping j : F →Y.
Recall further that these homomorphisms ﬁt into an exact sequence

mappings are group homomorphisms.




(I n, ∂I n), (X, {∗X})

,
f →π ◦f,
and this mapping descends to a group isomorphism πn(Y, F) →πn(X).
Proof Since π(F) = {∗X}, the mapping is well deﬁned. Moreover, for every pointed
pair homotopy H : I n × I →Y, the mapping π ◦H : I n × I →X is a pointed
homotopy.Hence,theassignment f →π ◦f descendstoamappingι : πn(Y, F) →
πn(X). Clearly, ι is a group homomorphism.
The mapping ι is injective: let f, g ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Y, F)

and H : I n × I →X
be a pointed homotopy from π ◦f to π ◦g. Every solution ˜H of the homotopy lifting
problem for π deﬁned by H and the initial condition
˜H0 : (I n × {0, 1}) ∪({e1} × I) →Y
given by
˜H0↾I n×{0} = f,
˜H0↾I n×{1} = g,
˜H0(e1, t) = ∗F
deﬁnes a homotopy ˜H : Dn × I →Y from f to g. Since the subset (I n × {0, 1}) ∪
({e1} × I) is a strong deformation retract of I n × I (Exercise 3.2.2), Proposition
3.2.3/2 yields that
˜H exists. Since π ◦˜Ht = Ht sends ∂I n to {∗X}, ˜H is a pair
homotopy. Since ˜H(e1, t) = ˜H0(e1, t) = ∗F, it is pointed.
The mapping ι is surjective: let f ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (X, {∗X})

. By Proposition
3.2.3/2, the lifting problem for π deﬁned by the mapping f : I n →X and the initial
condition ˜f0 : {e1} →Y, ˜f0(e1) := ∗F, has a solution ˜f : I n →Y. By construction,
˜f ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Y, F)

and ι[ ˜f ] = [ f ].
■
As a consequence, in the homotopy sequence of the pair (Y, F), we can replace
the relative homotopy groups πn(Y, F) by the ordinary homotopy groups πn(X), the
homomorphism i∗by ι ◦i∗and the homomorphism ∂by ∂◦ι−1. The homomorphism
∂◦ι−1 will be referred to as the boundary homomorphism of the ﬁbration π and will
be denoted by ∂. We determine these homomorphisms explicitly. On the one hand,
for f ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (Y, {∗F})

, we have ι ◦i∗([ f ]) = [π ◦f ]. On the other hand,
for f ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (X, {∗X})

, we have
∂([ f ]) = [ ˜f↾∂I n],
(3.2.5)

referred to as the homotopy sequence of the ﬁbration π. Exactness of (3.2.4) implies
the following.
Theorem 3.2.8 The homotopy sequence of a Serre ﬁbration is exact.
■
According to Corollary 3.2.5, this sequence applies in particular to a principal G-
bundle π : P →M. In this case, one can identify πn(F) with πn(G) by means of
an equivariant diffeomorphism κ : F →G sending the base point of F to the unit
element 1. Under this identiﬁcation, the boundary homomorphism reads
∂: πn(M) →πn−1(G),
∂([ f ]) = [κ ◦˜f↾∂I n],
(3.2.7)
where f ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (M, {∗M})

and ˜f ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (P, F)

is a lift of f
through π.
Recall that π0(G) can be identiﬁed with the set of connected components of
G and thus carries a natural group structure. This group acts on πn(G) by those
automorphisms which are induced by the inner automorphisms of G:
(aG0) · ([ f ]) = (Ca)∗([ f ]),
(3.2.8)
where a ∈G and f ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (G, 1)

. Here, G0 denotes the identity compo-
nent of G and Ca denotes conjugation by a.
Recall further that π1(M) acts on πn(M) from the right by automorphisms as
follows. Given [γ ] ∈π1(M) and [ f ] ∈πn(M), choose an extension ˜h : I n × I →
M of the mapping
h : (I n × {0}) ∪({0} × I) →M
deﬁned by h(t, 0) = f (t) and h(0, t) = γ (t) and put ϕ[γ ]([ f ]) := [g], where g(t) =
˜h(t, 1). Then, ϕ[γ ] is a group automorphism of πn(M) for every [γ ] ∈π1(M) and the
assignment of ϕ[γ ] to [γ ] is a group anti-homomorphism π1(M) →Aut

πn(M)

.
For simplicity, we will write [γ ] · [ f ] := ϕ[γ ]([ f ]).
Proposition 3.2.9 Let P be a topological principal G-bundle over M. For every
[γ ] ∈π1(M) and [ f ] ∈πn(M),

That is, via the boundary homomorphism in dimension 1, the boundary homomor-
phism in dimension n intertwines the action of π1(M) on πn(M) with the action of
π0(G) on πn−1(G).

Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
Proof Let γ and f be given and choose a representative g ∈C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (M, ∗M)

of [γ ] · [ f ] ∈πn(M). There exists a homotopy H : I n × I →M satisfying
H(0, t) = γ (t) for all t.5 Choose a lift
˜f of f through π : P →M and let
˜H : I n × I →P be a lift of H through π with initial condition ˜f . Then, the curve
˜γ : I →P deﬁned by
˜γ (t) := ˜H(0, t)
is a lift of γ and belongs to C∗

(I, ∂I), (P, F)

. Hence, according to (3.2.7), under
the identiﬁcation of π0(G) with the group of connected components of G,
∂([γ ]) = [κ ◦˜γ↾∂I] ≡aG0,
a := κ

˜γ (1)

.
Thus, on the one hand, according to (3.2.7) and (3.2.8), we have
∂([γ ]) · ∂([ f ]) = [Ca ◦κ ◦˜f↾∂I n].
On the other hand, Ψa−1 ◦˜H1 is a lift of g and belongs to C∗

(I n, ∂I n), (P, F)

.
Hence,
∂

[γ ] · [ f ]

= ∂([g]) = [κ ◦(Ψa−1 ◦˜H1)↾∂I n] = [Ra−1 ◦κ ◦( ˜H1)↾∂I n],
where Ra−1 denotes right translation by a−1. Thus, to prove the assertion, we have to
show that Ca ◦κ ◦˜f↾∂I n is pointed homotopic to Ra−1 ◦κ ◦( ˜H1)↾∂I n.
To see this, consider the (topological) principal G-bundle γ ∗P over I. Since ˜γ
is a global section of γ ∗P, it deﬁnes a global trivialization and hence a continuous
equivariant mapping ˜κ : γ ∗P →G which sends ˜γ (t) to 1 for all t ∈I. Since, by con-
struction, π ◦˜H(t, t) = H(t, t) = γ (t) for all t ∈∂I n, we can deﬁne a continuous
mapping
h : ∂I n × I →G,
h(t, t) := ˜κ

γ (t), ˜H(t, t)

.
Since ˜κ

γ (0), ˜γ (0)

= 1 = κ

˜γ (0)

, the equivariant mappings ˜κ and κ coincide on
the ﬁbre over t = 0. Hence,
h0 = κ ◦( ˜H0)↾∂I n = κ ◦˜f↾∂I n.
Since ˜κ

˜γ (1)

= 1 = a−1κ

˜γ (1)

, the equivariant mappings ˜κ and La−1 ◦κ coincide
on the ﬁbre over t = 1.6 Therefore,
h1 = La−1 ◦κ ◦( ˜H1)↾∂I n.
5A homotopy with this property is referred to as a homotopy along γ .
6Note that we could write ˜κ

˜γ (1)

=
  = κ

˜γ (1)

a−1 as well. This does however not mean that
˜κ coincides with Ra−1 ◦κ, because the latter mapping is not equivariant.

3.2 Fibrations
207
Since, in addition, we have h(0, t) = ˜κ

˜γ (t)

= 1 for every t ∈I, it follows that
Ca ◦h yields the desired homotopy.

Example 3.2.10 The exact homotopy sequence (3.2.6) can be used to compute the
homotopygroups of thequotients of freegroupactions. Here, wegivethreeexamples.
1. Consider the complex Hopf bundle S3 S1
→S2, cf. Example 1.1.20. Here, (3.2.6)
reads
. . . →πi(S1) →πi(S3) →πi(S2) →πi−1(S1) →. . . .
Since πi(S1) = πi−1(S1) = 0 for i > 2, we ﬁnd πi(S3) ∼= πi(S2) for all i > 2,
where the isomorphism is induced by the projection (the Hopf mapping). This
implies, in particular,
π3(S2) = π3(S3) = Z,
where the generator is given by the Hopf mapping itself, because the generator
of π3(S3) is the identical mapping.
2. Consider the action of the cyclic group of order two on Sn generated by the
antipodal mapping. The quotient manifold is the real projective space RPn. Since
π0(Z2) = Z2 and πk(Z2) = 0 for k > 0, we ﬁnd πk(RPn) ∼= πk(Sn) for all k > 1
and π1(RPn) = 0 for n > 1. For k = 1 and n = 1, we obtain the piece
0 →Z →π1(RP1) →Z2 →0,
(3.2.9)
so that the sequence does not give sufﬁcient information about π1(RP1). However,
we know that RP1 is homeomorphic to S1 and hence π1(RP1) = Z. In fact, under
this identiﬁcation, the second arrow in (3.2.9) is induced from the mapping S1 →
S1 deﬁned by taking the square.
3. By a similar analysis, using πi

(3.2.10)
The argument for RPn and CPn breaks down for HPn, because the group acting
is Sp(1) which is homeomorphic to S3 and thus has nontrivial higher homotopy
groups (which are not even known in full).
4. The exact homotopy sequence is also used to prove the vanishing of the lower
homotopy groups of the Stiefel manifolds, see the proof of Theorem 3.4.10.
♦
Next, we discuss the path-loop ﬁbration associated with a pointed Hausdorff space
X. As before, let t = 0 be the base point of I. By deﬁnition, the path space of X is
PX := C∗(I, X)

208
3
Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
endowed with the compact-open topology. This space consists of the continuous
curves in X starting at the base point ∗. As a base point of PX, we take the constant
curve at ∗. By assigning to every curve its endpoint, we obtain a pointed mapping
π : PX →X,
π(γ ) := γ (1).
(3.2.11)
This mapping is continuous, because the preimage of an open subset O ⊂X is given
by the open subset M({1}, O) of PX.
Theorem 3.2.11 The mapping (3.2.11) is a Hurewicz ﬁbration with ﬁbre
π−1(∗) = Ω X.
Therefore, the mapping (3.2.11) is referred to as the path-loop ﬁbration of X.
Proof Let Z be a topological space and consider the lifting problem for π deﬁned
by some f : Z × I →X and an appropriate initial condition ˜f0 : Z × {0} →PX.
By Proposition 3.1.1/3, via the relation
ˆf (z, t, s) =
 ˜f (z, t)

(s),
solutions ˜f : Z × I →PX oftheliftingproblemcorrespondtocontinuousmappings
ˆf : Z × I × I →X. In terms of ˆf , the condition that ˜f maps Z × I to PX reads
ˆf (z, t, 0) = ∗,
(3.2.12)
the lifting condition π ◦˜f = f reads
ˆf (z, t, 1) = f (z, t)
(3.2.13)
and the initial condition ˜f↾Z×{0} = ˜f0 reads
ˆf (z, 0, s) =
 ˜f0(z, 0)

(s).
(3.2.14)
Hence, by passing from ˜f to ˆf , we have turned the lifting problem into an extension
problem: the desired solution ˆf is an extension to Z × I × I of the mapping
(Z × I × {0, 1}) ∪(Z × {0} × I) →X
deﬁned by (3.2.12)-(3.2.14). Since the subset (I × {0, 1}) ∪({0} × I) is a retract
of I × I (Exercise 3.2.2), the subset (Z × I × {0, 1}) ∪(Z × {0} × I) is a retract
of Z × I × I. Therefore, the existence of ˆf , and hence of ˜f , follows from the fact
that if a topological space X is a retract of A ⊂X, then every continuous mapping
f : A →Y to a topological space Y has a continuous prolongation to X.
■
Proposition 3.2.12 The path space PX is contractible.

.
Using Proposition 3.1.1/3, one can check that F is continuous. Since it is a strong
deformation retraction of PX to the constant curve at ∗, the assertion follows.
■
As a consequence, the homotopy groups of PX are trivial. Thus, in view of Theorems
3.2.8 and 3.2.11, Proposition 3.2.12 implies the following.
Corollary 3.2.13 Forn ≥1,theboundaryhomomorphism∂: πn(X) →πn−1(Ω X)
is an isomorphism.
■
In fact, the boundary homomorphism coincides with the isomorphism provided by
Theorem 3.1.5 (Exercise 3.2.3).
Now, we turn to the discussion of pullbacks of ﬁbrations.7 To begin with, let π :
Y →X be a continuous mapping (not necessarily a ﬁbration). Let Z be a topological
space and let f : Z →X be a continuous mapping. Deﬁne
f ∗Y := {(z, y) ∈Z × Y : f (z) = π(y)}
with the induced topology. By restriction, the natural projections to the factors of
Z × Y induce continuous mappings
π f : f ∗Y →Z,
Ff : f ∗Y →Y,

The mapping π f is referred to as the pullback of π by f . Pullbacks have the following
universal property.
Proposition 3.2.14 Let W be a topological space. For every pair of mappings
ρ : W →Z and F : W →Y such that π ◦F = f ◦ρ, there exists a unique map-
ping ˜f : W →f ∗Y such that F = Ff ◦˜F and ρ = π f ◦˜F and this mapping is
continuous.
7This generalizes the pullback construction for principal bundles, cf. Remark 1.1.9.

Proof Since π ◦F = f ◦ρ, the mapping

takes values in the subset f ∗Y ⊂Z × Y. Hence, it induces a continuous mapping
˜F : W →f ∗Y. It is immediate that ˜F fulﬁls Ff ◦˜F = F and π f ◦˜F = ρ and that
any mapping fulﬁlling these two relations must coincide with ˜F.
■
Proposition 3.2.15 The pullback of a Serre ﬁbration is a Serre ﬁbration. An analo-
gous statement holds for Hurewicz ﬁbrations.
Proof Since the argument does not depend on the type of ﬁbration, we give it for
Serre ﬁbrations. Thus, assume that π is a Serre ﬁbration and consider the homotopy
lifting problem for π f deﬁned by a mapping g : Dn × I →Z and an appropriate ini-
tial condition ˜g0 : Dn × {0} →f ∗Y. Using (3.2.15), we check that the induced map-
ping f ◦g : Dn × I →X and the induced initial condition F f ◦˜g0 : Dn × {0} →Y
deﬁne a homotopy lifting problem for π. Let ˜h : Dn × I →Y be a solution. Then,
π ◦˜h = f ◦g. Hence, application of Proposition 3.2.14 to W = Dn × I, F = ˜h and
ρ = g yields a unique continuous mapping ˜g : Dn × I →f ∗Y such that Ff ◦˜g = ˜h
and π f ◦˜g = g. Then,
Ff ◦˜g↾Dn×{0} = ˜h↾Dn×{0} = Ff ◦˜g0,
π f ◦˜g↾Dn×{0} = g↾Dn×{0} = π f ◦˜g0
and hence, by uniqueness, ˜g↾Dn×{0} = ˜g0. Since, furthermore, the second equation
means that ˜g is a lift of g through π f , it follows that ˜g is a solution of the homotopy
lifting problem under consideration.
■
To conclude this section, we show how to turn an arbitrary continuous mapping into
a Hurewicz ﬁbration. Given f : Y →X, deﬁne
E f := {(y, γ ) ∈Y × C(I, X) : f (y) = γ (0)}
(3.2.16)
and the mappings

3.2 Fibrations
211
p f : E f →X, p f (y, γ ) := γ (1),
j f : Y →E f , j f (y) := (y, γ f (y)),
(3.2.17)
where γ f (y) denotes the constant path at f (y). By construction,
f = p f ◦j f .
We endow E f with the relative topology induced from the product topology of
Y × C(I, X), where C(I, X) carries the compact-open topology.
Proposition 3.2.16 The mapping p f is a Hurewicz ﬁbration. The mapping j f is a
homeomorphism onto its image and the image is a strong deformation retract of E f .
Proof First, consider the mapping p f . Let pr1 and pr2 denote the natural projections
to the ﬁrst and the second factor of Y × C(I, X), respectively.
By Proposition 3.1.1/2, p f is continuous. To see that it is a ﬁbration, consider the
lifting problem given by some g : Z × I →X and an appropriate initial condition
˜g0 : Z × {0} →E f . Then, p f ◦˜g0(z) = g(z, 0) for all z ∈Z, meaning that the curve
pr2 ◦˜g0(z) in X runs from f ◦pr1 ◦˜g0(z) to g(z, 0). Hence, for every t ∈I, we may
take the concatenation with the curve
γz,t : I →X,
γz,t(s) := g(z, st)
running from g(z, 0) to g(z, t). That the curves γz,t are indeed continuous follows
from point 3 of Proposition 3.1.1, because the mapping I × (Z × I) →X sending
(s, (z, t)) to g(z, st) is certainly continuous. In addition, this point yields that the
mapping
Z × I →C(I, X),
(z, t) →γz,t,
is continuous. Deﬁne
˜g : Z × I →E f ,
˜g(z, t) :=

pr1 ◦˜g0(z), pr2 ◦˜g0(z) · γz,t

.
Clearly, p f ◦˜g(z, t) = γz,t(1) = g(z, t), hence ˜g is a lift of g. To see that ˜g is con-
tinuous, it remains to show that the mapping from the subset
Δ := {(γ1, γ2) ∈C(I, X) × C(I, X) : γ1(1) = γ2(0)} ⊂C(I, X) × C(I, X)
to C(I, X) deﬁned by concatenation is continuous. In view of point 3 of Proposition
3.1.1, it sufﬁces to check that the mapping
Δ × I →X,
((γ1, γ2), t) →γ1 · γ2(t),
is continuous. Continuity in t for all ﬁxed (γ1, γ2) is obvious. Continuity in (γ1, γ2)
for each ﬁxed t follows from point 2 of Proposition 3.1.1, because the image is either
γ1(2t) or γ2(2t −1).

Now, consider the mapping j f . For every subset A ⊂Y, one has j f (A) =
pr−1
1 (A) ∩j f (Y). Hence, if A is open, so is j f (A) in j f (Y). This shows that j f is a
homeomorphism onto its image. Given γ ∈C(I, X) and s ∈I, deﬁne γs ∈C(I, X)
by γs(t) := γ ((1 −s)t). Thus, γ0 = γ and γ1 is the constant curve at γ (0). Since the
mapping I × (C(I, X) × I) →X sending

t, (γ, s)

to γs(t) is continuous, Propo-
sition 3.1.1/3 implies that the mapping C(I, X) × I →C(I, X) sending (γ, s) to γs
is continuous. Hence, so is the mapping
E f × I →E f ,

(y, γ ), s

It provides a strong deformation retraction of E f to the subset j f (Y).

Remark 3.2.17 One can show that the ﬁbres p−1(x) over a pathwise connected
component of a ﬁbration f : Y →X are all homotopy equivalent [288, Prop. 4.61].
The homotopy type of the ﬁbres is usually referred to as the homotopy ﬁbre of
the ﬁbration. Proposition 3.2.16 allows to extend this notion to arbitrary mappings
f : Y →X by deﬁning the homotopy ﬁbre of f to be the homotopy ﬁbre of the
associated ﬁbration p f .

The Covering Homotopy Theorem
We are now addressing the classiﬁcation problem of principal bundles. The ﬁnal
result will be that, for a given Lie group G and a given smooth base manifold M, the
vertical isomorphism classes of smooth principal G-bundles over M are in bijective
correspondence with the homotopy classes of continuous mappings from M to some
topological space BG to be constructed. We will solve the classiﬁcation problem for
topological principal bundles under the additional assumptions that G is a Lie group
with ﬁnitely many connected components and that the base space is paracompact
Hausdorff and of CW-homotopy type, meaning that it is homotopy equivalent to a
CW-complex. This situation is particularly simple, and it is all we need.
We will proceed in three steps. First, in the present section, we prove the Covering
Homotopy Theorem. Then, in Sect.3.4, we classify topological principal bundles.

3.3 The Covering Homotopy Theorem
213
Finally, in Sect.3.6, we show that the vertical isomorphism classes of smooth princi-
pal G-bundles over M are in bijective correspondence with the vertical isomorphism
classes of topological principal bundles over M.
Let X be a paracompact Hausdorff space and let I = [0, 1]. Since we want to
relate bundle isomorphisms with homotopies of mappings deﬁned on X, we need to
know how topological principal bundles over X × I look like. One particular type
is given by bundles of the form Q × I, where Q is a topological principal G-bundle
over X and where G acts trivially on I.
Theorem 3.3.1 (Topological principal bundles over X × I) Let G be a Lie group
and let X be a paracompact Hausdorff space. Every topological principal G-bundle
P over X × I is vertically isomorphic to P0 × I, where P0 = P↾X×{0} is viewed as
a bundle over X. The isomorphism can be chosen so that its restriction to P0 ⊂P
coincides with the inclusion P0 →P0 × I given by p0 →(p0, 0).
Undertheassumptionthat X isaCW-complex,theassertionfollowsfromProposition
3.2.3/1 and the fact that topological ﬁbre bundles are Serre ﬁbrations (Exercise 3.3.1).
For the proof, we need the following fact.
Lemma 3.3.2 Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.3.1, there exists a locally ﬁnite
open covering {Ui : i = 1, 2, . . . } of X such that P is trivial over Ui × I for all i.
Proof of the Lemma. We proceed in two steps. First, we show that every x ∈X
possesses an open neighbourhood U such that P is trivial over U × I. Second, from
the open covering so obtained, we construct a locally ﬁnite and countable one.
Let x ∈X be given. By local triviality, for every t ∈I, there exists an open
neighbourhood Vt of x and an open interval It containing t such that P is trivial
over Vt × It. By compactness of I, we can ﬁnd 0 < t1 < · · · < tk < 1 such that
It1, . . . , Itk cover I. Denote Vi := Vti and Ii := Iti and deﬁne

Clearly, P is trivial over U1 × J1. We will show that a trivialization χ1 of P over
U1 × J1 and a trivialization ˜χ2 of P over V2 × I2 induce a trivialization χ2 of P over
U2 × J2. We have
(U1 × J1) ∩(V2 × I2) = U2 × (J1 ∩I2).
If J1 ∩I2 is empty, we can choose χ2 = χ1 on P↾U1×J1 and χ2 = ˜χ2 on P↾V2×I2.
If J1 ⊂I2 or I2 ⊂J1, we can choose χ2 = ˜χ2 or χ2 = χ1, respectively. Otherwise,
consider the transition function ρ : U2 × (J1 ∩I2) →G deﬁned by χ1(p) = ˜χ2(p) ·

yields a trivialization of P over U2 × J2. By iterating this argument, we ﬁnally obtain
that P is trivial over U × I, where U = Uk. As a result, we ﬁnd an open covering
U = {Uα : α ∈A} of X such that P is trivial over Uα × I for all α.
Next, from U , we construct an open covering which is locally ﬁnite and countable.
Since X is paracompact, we may assume that U is locally ﬁnite. Since X is in
addition Hausdorff, there exists a subordinate partition of unity { fα : α ∈A}, that is,
supp( fα) ⊂Uα for all α. For a given ﬁnite subset S ⊂A, deﬁne a subset US of X by
US := {x ∈X :

fα −fα′
(x) > 0 for all α ∈S, α′ /∈S}.
The subsets US are open: for every x ∈US, there exists an open neighbourhood Vx
of x in X such that fα′(x) ̸= 0 for only ﬁnitely many α′. Hence, US ∩Vx is the subset
of Vx where a given ﬁnite number of continuous functions take nonzero values. It
follows that US ∩Vx is open in Vx and hence in X. This shows that US is open in X.
Now, for i = 1, 2, . . . , let Ui be the union of all US with S ⊂A having i elements.
The family {Ui : i = 1, 2, . . . } covers X, because x ∈Uix, where ix is the number
of elements α of A such that fα ̸= 0 in some neighbourhood of x. It is locally ﬁnite,
because x /∈Ui for all i > ix.
It remains to show that P is trivial over Ui × I for each i. On the one hand, P is
trivial over US × I for all S, because US ⊂supp( fα) and hence US ⊂Uα for every
α ∈S. On the other hand, the US with S ⊂A having i elements form a disjoint
decomposition of Ui, because if S ̸= S′, then S \ S′ contains an element α and S′ \ S
contains an element α′. Elements x of US ∩US′ would fulﬁl fα(x) > fα′(x) and
fα(x) < fα′(x), which is a contradiction.
■
Proof of Theorem 3.3.1. By Lemma 3.3.2, there exists a locally ﬁnite open covering
U = {Ui : i = 1, 2, . . . } of X such that P is trivial over Ui × I for all i. For each
i, let χi be a trivialization of P↾Ui×I and let ˆχi denote the induced trivialization of
(P0↾Ui) × I.
Since X is paracompact Hausdorff, there exists a closed covering {Wi : i =
1, 2, . . . } subordinate to U , that is, Wi ⊂Ui,8 and this covering is locally ﬁnite,
too. Consider the nested sequence of closed subsets covering X which is formed by
the unions ˜Wi := i
j=1 W j. We will construct the desired isomorphism by induction
8For example, one may choose Wi = supp( fi) for a partition of unity subordinate to U .

3.3 The Covering Homotopy Theorem

on i, that is, we will successively construct open neighbourhoods Vi of ˜Wi and ver-
tical isomorphisms Φi over Vi × I. Since P↾U1×I and hence (P0↾U1) × I are trivial,
we may put V1 = U1 and choose a vertical isomorphism
Φ1 : P↾V1×I →(P0↾V1) × I
so that (Φ1)↾(P0↾V1) = id(P0↾V1). Now, assume that we have found an open neighbour-
hood Vi of ˜Wi and a vertical isomorphism
Φi : P↾Vi×I →(P0↾Vi) × I
satisfying (Φi)↾(P0↾Vi ) = id(P0↾Vi ). Via the trivializations χi+1 and ˆχi+1, Φi is repre-
sented over (Vi × I) ∩(Ui+1 × I) = (Vi ∩Ui+1) × I by a continuous mapping
g : (Vi ∩Ui+1) × I →G
satisfying g(x, 0) = 1G for all x ∈Vi ∩Ui+1. Since paracompact Hausdorff spaces
are normal, there exist open subsets O1, O2 such that
˜Wi ⊂O1,
O1 ⊂O2,
O2 ⊂Vi
and, by Urysohn's Lemma, a continuous function h : Vi ∪Ui+1 →I which takes
the constant value 1 on O1 and has support in O2. Using h, we deﬁne a mapping
˜g : Ui+1 × I →G,
˜g(x, t) :=

g

x, h(x)t

| x ∈O2,

| x /∈O2.
Via the trivializations χi+1 and ˆχi+1, the mapping ˜g represents a vertical isomorphism
˜Φ : P↾Ui+1×I →(P0↾Ui+1) × I.
Let Vi+1 := O1 ∪Ui+1. Since on (Ui+1 × I) ∩(O1 × I) = (Ui+1 ∩O1) × I, the
mapping ˜g coincides with g, the isomorphisms ˜Φ and (Φi)↾(P↾O1×I ) coincide on their
common domain. Hence, they combine to a vertical isomorphism
Φi+1 : P↾Vi+1×I →(P0↾Vi+1) × I.
Finally, since ˜g(x, 0) = 1G for all x ∈Ui+1, we have ˜Φ↾(P0↾Ui+1) = id(P0↾Ui+1) and
hence (Φi+1)↾(P0↾Vi+1) = id(P0↾Vi+1). This proves the theorem.

Corollary 3.3.4 (Covering Homotopy Theorem) Let X and Y be paracompact Hau-
dorff spaces and let P and Q be topological principal G-bundles over X and
Y, respectively. Let H : X × I →Y be a continuous mapping. Every principal
G-bundle morphism P →Q covering H0 has a prolongation to a principal G-
bundle morphism P × I →Q covering H.
Since the projection Q →Y is a Serre ﬁbration, we already know from Proposition
3.2.3/1 that the lifting problem deﬁned by the mapping H ◦(πP × idI) : P × I →
M and the initial condition ˜H0 has a solution. What the Covering Homotopy Theorem
states in addition is that the solution can be chosen to consist of principal G-bundle
morphisms.

The other consequence of Theorem 3.3.1 leads, in effect, to the idea of classifying
principal bundles in terms of homotopy classes of mappings.
Corollary 3.3.5 (Homotopy implies isomorphism) Let G be a Lie group and let
Q be a topological principal G-bundle over a topological space B. Let X be a
paracompact Hausdorff space and let f, g : X →B be continuous mappings. If f
and g are homotopic, then the topological principal G-bundles f ∗Q and g∗Q over
K are vertically isomorphic.
Proof Let H : X × I →B be a homotopy from f to g, that is, H(·, 0) = f and
H(·, 1) = g. Consider the topological principal G-bundle P := H ∗Q over X × I.
Let Pt := P↾X×{t}, viewed as a bundle over X. Clearly, P0 = f ∗Q and P1 = g∗Q. By
Theorem 3.3.1, P is vertically isomorphic to P0 × I. By restricting an isomorphism

3.4
Universal Principal Bundles
In this section, we classify topological principal bundles over paracompact Hausdorff
spaces of CW-homotopy type up to vertical isomorphisms.
For a Lie group G and a topological space X, let PFB(G, X) denote the totality
of vertical isomorphism classes of topological principal G-bundles over X. As a
consequence of Corollary 3.3.5, given a topological principal G-bundle Q over B,
for every paracompact Hausdorff space X, the assignment of the pullback bundle
f ∗Q to a continuous mapping f : X →B induces a mapping
[X, B] →PFB(G, X).
(3.4.1)
Deﬁnition 3.4.1 (Topological universal bundle) Let G be a Lie group and let E be
a pathwise connected topological principal G-bundle over a paracompact Hausdorff
space B of CW-homotopy type.
1. E is called a universal bundle for G and B is called a classifying space for G
if the mapping (3.4.1) is a bijection for all paracompact Hausdorff spaces X of
CW-homotopy type.
2. For n = 1, 2, . . . , E is called an n-universal bundle for G and B is called an
n-classifying space for G if the mapping (3.4.1) is a bijection for all paracompact
Hausdorff spaces X of the homotopy type of a CW-complex of dimension n or
less.
In either case, given a principal G-bundle P over a space X, any mapping f : X →B
such that P ∼= f ∗E is said to be a classifying mapping for P.
Clearly, a topological principal G-bundle is universal iff it is n-universal for all n.
In what follows, we ﬁrst discuss uniqueness and then existence of universal bun-
dles. Uniqueness is a direct consequence of the fact that, by our deﬁnition, the base
space of a universal bundle is paracompact Hausdorff of CW-homotopy type.
Deﬁnition 3.4.2 Two topological principal G-bundles P1 over X1 and P2 over X2
are said to be G-homotopy equivalent if there exist G-morphisms F1 : P1 →P2 and
F2 : P2 →P1 such that F2 ◦F1 and F1 ◦F2 are homotopic through G-morphisms
to vertical automorphisms of P1 and P2, respectively.

Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
Clearly, G-homotopy equivalent principal G-bundles have homotopy equivalent base
spaces.
Proposition 3.4.3 Any two classifying spaces for G are homotopy equivalent. Any
two universal bundles for G are G-homotopy equivalent.
It is, therefore, common to speak of the universal bundle and the classifying space for
G, and to write EG and BG for (representatives9 of) the corresponding equivalence
classes.
Proof Let Ei be universal G-bundles over Bi, i = 1, 2. Since E2 is universal, and
since B1 isparacompactHausdorffofCW-homotopytype, E1 isverticallyisomorphic
to f ∗
1 E2 for an appropriate classifying mapping f1 : B1 →B2. By analogy, E2 is
vertically isomorphic to f ∗
2 E1 for an appropriate classifying mapping f2 : B2 →B1.
Then, E1 is vertically isomorphic to f ∗
1 ( f ∗
2 E1) and hence to ( f2 ◦f1)∗E1. Since E1
is universal, and since E1 = id∗
B1 E1, it follows that f2 ◦f1 is homotopic to idB1.
An analogous argument shows that f1 ◦f2 is homotopic to idB2. Hence, f1 and f2
provide a homotopy equivalence between B1 and B2.
Now, consider the total spaces E1 and E2. The natural G-morphism f ∗
1 E2 →E2
combines with a vertical isomorphism E1 →f ∗
1 E2 to a G-morphism F1 : E1 →E2
covering f1. Analogously, we obtain a G-morphism F2 : E2 →E1 covering f2.
Then, F2 ◦F1 is a G-automorphism of E1 covering f2 ◦f1. Since f2 ◦f1 is homo-
topic to idB1, by the Covering Homotopy Theorem 3.3.4, there exists a homotopy
through G-morphisms from F2 ◦F1 to some G-morphism of E1 covering idB1, that
is, to some vertical automorphism of E1. An analogous argument shows that F1 ◦F2
is homotopic through G-morphisms to a vertical automorphism of E2. Thus, F1 and
F2 provide a G-homotopy equivalence between E1 and E2.
■
Now, we are going to discuss the existence of universal bundles. Before entering the
actual construction, we derive a criterion for universality in terms of the homotopy
groups of the total space E. We start with a criterion for the extendability of sections10
in topological ﬁbre bundles over CW-complexes.
Lemma 3.4.4 (Prolongation of sections) Let K be a CW-complex and let L ⊂K
be a subcomplex. Let E be a topological ﬁbre bundle over K with typical ﬁbre V . If
πi(V ) = 0 for all i < dim K, then every section of E↾L can be extended to a section
of E.
Proof We give the argument for an inﬁnite dimensional CW-complex. The ﬁnite
dimensional case is then obvious.
By possibly reﬁning the CW-complex structure, we may assume that E is trivial
over every cell of K. For i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , let K (i) denote the i-skeleton of K. We
will prove the assertion by induction on i. Since K (0) is discrete, the given section
of E over L extends to a section s0 over L ∪K (0). Thus, for i > 0, assume that
9A particular representative is called a model of the classifying space for G.
10Recall that sections in topological ﬁbre bundles are assumed to be continuous.

3.4 Universal Principal Bundles
219
si is a section of E over L ∪K (i) and let α : Di+1 →K be an (i + 1)-cell. Since
α(∂Di+1) ⊂K (i), si induces a section ˜si of (α∗E)↾∂Di+1. We have to show that ˜si
extends to a section of α∗E. By the assumption that E is trivial over every cell of
K, α∗E is a trivial ﬁbre bundle over Di+1 with typical ﬁbre V . Hence, sections
correspond to mappings Di+1 →V and we have to show that every continuous
mapping fi : ∂Di+1 →V extends to a continuous mapping fi+1 : Di+1 →V . Since
πi(V ) = 0, fi is homotopic to a constant mapping via H : ∂Di+1 × I →V . Since
H1 maps ∂Di+1 to the base point of V , H induces a continuous mapping ˆH from
the cone over ∂Di+1 to V . Since the cone over ∂Di+1 is homeomorphic to Di+1, we
obtain an extension fi+1.
As a result, we obtain a family of sections {si : i = 0, 1, 2, . . . } over the skeleta.
By Proposition 3.1.12, this family deﬁnes a continuous mapping s : K →E. By
construction, s is a section.
■
By applying Lemma 3.4.4 to the case where L consists of a single point, we obtain
the following.
Corollary 3.4.5 (Existence of sections) Let E be a topological ﬁbre bundle over a
CW-complex K with typical ﬁbre V . If πi(V ) = 0 for all i < dim K, then E admits
a section.
■
Now, we can formulate the criterion for universality announced above.
Theorem 3.4.6 (Universality criterion) Let G be a Lie group and let E be a topo-
logical principal G-bundle over a paracompact Hausdorff space B of CW-homotopy
type. If πi(E) = 0 for all i ≤n, then E is n-universal for G. If πi(E) = 0 for all i,11
then E is universal.
Proof Clearly, it sufﬁces to prove n-universality. Let K be a CW-complex of dimen-
sion dim(K) ≤n. First, we show that the mapping (3.4.1) is bijective for X = K.
To check surjectivity, let P be a topological principal G-bundle over K. It sufﬁces
to ﬁnd a G-morphism P →E, because the pullback of E by the projection of
such a morphism is vertically isomorphic to P. For that purpose, recall that the G-
morphisms P →E correspond to the sections in the associated ﬁbre bundle P ×G E.
Since this bundle has typical ﬁbre E and since πi(E) = 0 for all i < n, the assertion
follows from Corollary 3.4.5.
To check injectivity, let there be given continuous mappings f0, f1 : K →B
and assume that there exists a vertical isomorphism Φ : f ∗
0 E →f ∗
1 E. Let Fi :
f ∗
i E →E be the natural G-morphisms. Then, F1 ◦Φ : f ∗
0 E →E is a G-morphism
covering f1. It sufﬁces to ﬁnd a G-morphism H : f ∗
0 E × I →E such that
H(·, 0) = F0,
H(·, 1) = F1 ◦Φ,
because the projection h : K × I →B of H then satisﬁes
11That is, if E is weakly contractible.

220

Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
h(·, 0) = f0,
h(·, 1) = f1
and thus yields a homotopy from f0 to f1. To ﬁnd H, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a section in the
associated ﬁbre bundle ( f ∗
0 E × I) ×G E whose restrictions to K × {0} and K × {1}
correspond to the morphisms F0 and F1 ◦Φ, respectively. Since this bundle has
typical ﬁbre E, and since πi(E) = 0 for all i < dim(K × I) ≤n + 1, the existence
of such a section follows from the Prolongation Lemma 3.4.4. This proves injectivity.
Now, let X be a paracompact Hausdorff space which is homotopy equivalent to
K. Let h : X →K and k : K →X be a homotopy equivalence.
To see that the mapping (3.4.1) is surjective, let P be a topological principal G-
bundle over X. Then, k∗P is a topological principal G-bundle over K and hence
vertically isomorphic to f ∗E for some continuous mapping f : K →B. It follows
that we have the vertical isomorphisms
( f ◦h)∗E →h∗( f ∗E) →h∗(k∗P) →(k ◦h)∗P →P,
where the last one is due to Corollary 3.3.5.
To see that the mapping (3.4.1) is injective, let there be given continuous map-
pings f1, f2 : X →B and assume that f ∗
1 E be vertically isomorphic to f ∗
2 E. Then,
the topological principal G-bundles k∗( f ∗
1 E) and k∗( f ∗
2 E) over K are vertically
isomorphic. Hence, f1 ◦k is homotopic to f2 ◦k and thus f1 ◦k ◦h is homotopic
to f2 ◦k ◦h. Since k ◦h is homotopic to idX, then f1 is homotopic to f2.
■
In addition to Theorem 3.4.6, we will also need a criterion which applies to universal
bundles for closed subgroups of G. Let E be a topological principal G-bundle over
B and let H ⊂G be a closed subgroup. Recall that the action of G on E reduces
to an action of H and that the latter makes E into a principal H-bundle over the
topological quotient E/H.
Lemma 3.4.7 Let G be a compact Lie group and let E be a topological principal
G-bundle over a paracompact Hausdorff space B of CW-homotopy type. For every
closed subgroup H ⊂G, the quotient space E/H is paracompact Hausdorff of CW-
homotopy type.
Proof We use that the induced projection E/H →B is a topological ﬁbre bun-
dle with typical ﬁbre being the homogeneous space G/H. Since B and G/H are
Hausdorff, so is E/H (Exercise 3.4.1). Since B is paracompact, by Proposition 3.2.6,
the induced projection is a Hurewicz ﬁbration. Since, in addition, B is pathwise con-
nected and both G/H and B are of CW-homotopy type, Theorem 5.4.2 in [221]
yields that E/H is of CW-homotopy type.
To see that E/H is paracompact, let U = {Ui : i ∈I} be an open covering of
E/H. We have to ﬁnd a locally ﬁnite open reﬁnement of U . Since B is paracompact,
π admits a system of local trivializations {(Vα, χα) : α ∈A} such that the open
covering V = {Vα : α ∈A} is locally ﬁnite. For each α, we ﬁnd an open subset
Wα ⊂Vα such that the closure Wα ⊂Vα and {Wα : α ∈A} is an open covering
of B; for example one may put Wα = {x ∈B : fα(x) ̸= 0} for a partition of unity
{ fα : α ∈A} subordinate to V . By intersecting the members of U with π−1(Wα),

3.4 Universal Principal Bundles
221
we obtain an open covering Uα of π−1(Wα). Since this space is homeomorphic to
the direct product of the paracompact space Wα with the compact space G/H, it
is paracompact.12 Hence, Uα admits a locally ﬁnite reﬁnement. By intersecting the
members of Uα with π−1(Wα), we obtain a locally ﬁnite family of open subsets of
E/H covering π−1(Wα). By taking the union of these families over all α, we then
obtain an open reﬁnement of U . It is locally ﬁnite, because so is V and hence the
family {π−1(Wα) : α ∈A}.
■
In view of Lemma 3.4.7, Theorem 3.4.6 implies the following.
Corollary 3.4.8 Let G be a compact Lie group and let H ⊂G be a closed subgroup.
Let E be a topological principal G-bundle over a paracompact Hausdorff space B
of CW-homotopy type. If πi(E) = 0 for all i ≤n, the induced principal H-bundle
E →E/H is n-universal for H. If πi(E) = 0 for all i, this bundle is universal
for H.
■
Remark 3.4.9 If πi(E) = 0 for all i ≤n, the exact homotopy sequence (3.2.6)
implies
π1(BG) = G/G0,
πi(BG) = πi−1(G) for 2 ≤i ≤n,
(3.4.2)
where G0 denotes the identity component of G.
♦
Now, we are going to prove that universal bundles exist for all Lie groups with a ﬁnite
number of connected components. We start with discussing the classical compact
Lie groups O(k), U(k) and Sp(k).
Let K = R, C or H and let k < l be positive integers. Consider the Stiefel bundle
SK(k,l) →GK(k,l),
where SK(k,l) denotes the Stiefel manifold of k-frames in Kl and GK(k,l) denotes
the Graßmann manifold of k-dimensional subspaces of Kl and the projection assigns
to a frame the subspace spanned by that frame. According to Example 1.1.24, the
Stiefel bundle is a smooth principal bundle with structure group O(k) in case K = R,
U(k) in case K = C and Sp(k) in case K = H.
Theorem 3.4.10 The Stiefel bundle SK(k,l) →GK(k,l) fulﬁls πi

SK(k,l)

= 0 for
all i ≤n and is thus n-universal
1. for O(k) in case K = R and l ≥n + 1 + k,
2. for U(k) in case K = C and l ≥n/2 + k,
3. for Sp(k) in case K = H and l ≥n/4 −1/2 + k.
Proof Since the base spaces are manifolds, they are paracompact Hausdorff of CW-
homotopy type.13 Hence, according to Theorem 3.4.6, it sufﬁces to check the homo-
topy groups of the Stiefel manifolds. We claim that
12This argument is the reason why G is assumed to be compact.
13In fact, GK(k,l) admits a canonical CW-complex structure, see Sect.6 in [451].

Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
πi(SK(k,l)) = 0 for all i ≤d(l −k) + d −2,
(3.4.3)
where d denotes the dimension of K over R. From this, one obtains points 1-3 by
plugging in n for i.
Consider the case K = R. The exact sequence of homotopy groups (3.2.6) for the
principal O(l −k)-bundle
O(l) →O(l)/O(l −k) ∼= SR(k,l)
contains the pieces
πi(O(l −k))
ι∗→πi(O(l)) →πi(SR(k,l))
∂→πi−1(O(l −k))
ι∗→πi−1(O(l)),
(3.4.4)
where
ι : O(l −k) →O(l),
ι(a) =

.
We decompose ι into the sequence of embeddings
O(l −k)
ι1
−→O(l −k + 1)
ι2
−→· · ·
ιk
−→O(l).
Since ι1 makes O(l −k + 1) into a principal bundle over Sl−k with structure group
O(l −k), from (3.2.6) we obtain exact sequences
πi+1(Sl−k) −→πi(O(l −k))
ι1 ∗
−→πi(O(l −k + 1)) −→πi(Sl−k),
showingthatι1 ∗isanisomorphismfori < l −k −1andsurjectivefori = l −k −1.
By replacing k by k −1, . . . , 1 in this argument, we obtain that the homomorphisms
of the i-th homotopy groups induced by, respectively, ι2, . . . , ιk are isomorphisms
for all i ≤l −k −1. Consequently,
ι∗= ι1 ∗◦· · · ◦ιk ∗: πi

is an isomorphism for all i < l −k −1 and surjective for i = l −k −1. Now,
exactness of (3.4.4) implies that for i ≤l −k −1, we have πi

SR(k,l)

= 0.
This proves (3.4.3) for K = R. The arguments for K = C and K = H are similar
(Exercise 3.4.2).
■
For the Lie groups O(1) ∼= Z2, U(1) and Sp(1), Theorem 3.4.10 yields, respectively,
the n-universal bundles
Sl →RPl, l ≥n + 2,
S2l+1 →CPl, l ≥n/2,
S4l+3 →HPl
l ≥n/4 −1/2.

As a consequence of Corollary 3.4.8, by embedding the cyclic group Zr as
Zr →U(1),
s →e2πis/r,
(3.4.5)
from the Stiefel bundle S2l+1 →CPl, we obtain the n-universal bundle
S2l+1 →L2l+1
r
≡S2l+1/Zr,
l ≥n/2,
for Zr. The quotient manifold L2l+1
r
is referred to as a lens space. It has the structure
of a smooth principal bundle over CPl with structure group U(1)/Zr ∼= U(1).
As another consequence of Corollary 3.4.8, for the subgroups SO(k) ⊂O(k) and
SU(k) ⊂U(k), Theorem 3.4.10 yields, respectively, the n-universal bundles
SR(k,l) →˜GR(k,l) ≡SR(k,l)/SO(k),
l ≥n + k + 1,
SC(k,l) →˜GC(k,l) ≡SC(k,l)/SU(k),
l ≥n/2 + k.
The quotient manifold ˜GR(k,l) has the structure of a smooth principal bundle over
GR(k,l) with structure group O(k)/SO(k) ∼= O(1). Accordingly, the quotient man-
ifold ˜GC(k,l) has the structure of a smooth principal bundle over GC(k,l) with
structure group U(k)/SU(k) ∼= U(1).
Remark 3.4.11
1. The principal bundle structure in the classifying spaces of Zr, SO(k) and SU(k)
observed here generalizes to arbitrary closed normal subgroups, see Proposition
3.7.5 below.
2. In the situation of a closed subgroup H of O(k), it is actually not necessary to
use Lemma 3.4.7 to prove Corollary 3.4.8, because the action of O(k) on SR(k,l)
restricts to a smooth free proper action of H on SR(k,l) and Corollary 6.5.1
in Part I implies that the topological quotient SR(k,l)/H is a smooth manifold.
Hence, it is automatically paracompact Hausdorff of CW-homotopy type. A sim-
ilar statement holds true for closed subgroups of U(k) and Sp(k).
♦
Theexistenceofn-universalbundlesfortheorthogonalgroupsentailstheexistenceof
n-universal bundles for all Lie groups with a ﬁnite number of connected components
by the following argument.
First, by a theorem due to Iwasawa [341] and Malcev [420], there exists a maximal
compact subgroup K ⊂G and a submanifold N ⊂G, diffeomorphic to a real vector
space, such that the mapping
μ : K × N →G,
μ(k, n) := kn,

is a diffeomorphism.14 This generalizes the polar decomposition of GL(n, R) and
GL(n, C), cf. Exercise 5.1.9 in Part I. In the case where G is simply connected, the
theorem is due to É. Cartan [122].
Second, being compact, K admits a ﬁnite-dimensional faithful real representation,
see Remark 3.4.14 below. By Proposition 5.5.6 in Part I, this representation admits
an invariant scalar product. Thus, by choosing an orthonormal basis, we obtain a Lie
subgroup embedding K →O(k) for some k. Then, the action of O(k) on SR(k,l)
restricts to a smooth free proper action of K, thus turning SR(k,l) into a smooth
principal K-bundle over SR(k,l)/K. By extending the structure group from K to G,
we ﬁnally obtain the smooth principal G-bundle
SR(k,l) ×K G →SR(k,l)/K.
(3.4.7)
Corollary 3.4.12 Let G be a Lie group with ﬁnitely many connected components, let
K be a maximal compact subgroup of G and let K ⊂O(k) via a faithful orthogonal
representation. For l ≥n + k + 1, the topological principal G-bundle underlying
(3.4.7) fulﬁls πi(SR(k,l) ×K G) = 0 for all i ≤n and is thus n-universal for G.
In particular, n-universal bundles exist for all Lie groups with a ﬁnite number of
connected components and all n.
Proof Denote E := SR(k,l). Since by Theorem 3.4.10, the assertion holds true for
E, it sufﬁces to show that E ×K G is a deformation retract of E. In the following
argument, details are left to the reader (Exercise 3.4.3).
Let I = [0, 1] and let prK : G →K and prN : G →N denote the mappings
obtained by composing the inverse of the diffeomorphism (3.4.6) with the natural
projections in the direct product K × N. Since N is diffeomorphic to a vector space,
there exists a strong deformation retraction ϕN : N × I →N of N onto the one-point
subset {1}. Then,
ϕG : G × I →G,
ϕG(a, t) := μ

prK(a), ϕN

is a strong deformation retraction of G onto K. For all a ∈G, k ∈K and t ∈I, we
have prK(ka) = k prK(a) and prN(ka) = prN(a), and hence ϕG(ka, t) = kϕG(a, t).
Therefore, ϕG induces a mapping
ϕ : (E ×K G) × I →E ×K G,
ϕ ([(e, a)] , t) := [(e, ϕG(a, t))] .
It is not hard to see that ϕ is a strong deformation retraction of E ×K G onto the
subset E ×K K = E. This proves the corollary.
■
Example 3.4.13 (Principal bundles over spheres) Consider the case where M = Sn
and G is a connected Lie group. Let E →B be an n-universal bundle for G. Since
E is pathwise connected, so is B. Since G is connected, (3.4.2) yields π1(B) = 0.
14For a detailed proof, see Sect.3.7 of [302] or Theorem XV.3.1 of [310].

3.4 Universal Principal Bundles

Since for a pathwise connected topological space X, the mapping πn(X) →[Sn, X]
induced by the natural inclusion mapping C∗(Sn, X) →C(Sn, X) descends to a
bijection from πn(X)/π1(X) onto [Sn, X], this implies [Sn, B] = πn(B).15 On the
other hand, according to (3.4.2), we have πn(B) ∼= πn−1(G). It follows that the ver-
tical isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles over Sn are in bijective correspon-
dence with the elements of πn−1(G). This is consistent with the ˇCech cohomological
description of these bundles in terms of transition mappings: we can cover Sn by
two contractible open subsets whose intersection can be retracted to the equator
Sn−1. Hence, according to Proposition 1.1.10 and Theorem 1.1.11, since G is con-
nected, vertical isomorphism classes of topological principal G-bundles over Sn are
in bijective correspondence with homotopy classes of continuous mappings from
Sn−1 →G.
For example, in case G = U(1), we obtain that nontrivial U(1)-bundles over Sn
exist for n = 2 only and that, in this case, they are classiﬁed by an integer. For a
detailed discussion of principal bundles over spheres, we refer to [599].
♦
Remark 3.4.14 The fact that every compact Lie group G admits a ﬁnite-dimensional
faithful representation is a consequence of a central result in the theory of compact Lie
groups, the Peter-Weyl Theorem. This theorem states that the representative functions
form a dense subset of the Hilbert space L2(G, v) of real or complex valued functions
on G which are square integrable with respect to a bi-invariant volume form16 v, see
for example [105, Theorem III.3.1]. Recall that a representative function is a linear
combination of functions of the form
G →K,
a →⟨η, ρ(a)v⟩
(3.4.8)
where v ∈V and η ∈V ∗for some C-vector space V carrying a ﬁnite-dimensional
irreducible representation ρ : G →Aut(V ). To conclude from this that G admits a
ﬁnite-dimensional faithful representation, let a1 ∈G such that a1 ̸= 1. Since the
elements of L2(G, v) separate the points of G and since functions of the form
(3.4.8) are dense in L2(G, v), there exists a function of this form satisfying f (a1) ̸=
f (1). This means that there exists a ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible K-representation
ρ1 : G →Aut(V1) such that a1 /∈ker(ρ1) and hence K1 := ker(ρ1) is properly con-
tained in G. If ρ1 is faithful, we are done. Otherwise, there exists a2 ∈K1 such that
a2 ̸= 1. By the same argument as above, we can ﬁnd a function f of the form (3.4.8)
such that f (a2) ̸= f (1), and hence a ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible K-representation
ρ2 : G →Aut(V2) such that a2 /∈ker(ρ2). Then, K2 := K1 ∩ker(ρ2) is properly
contained in K1. Iterating this argument, we obtain a sequence K1, K2, . . . of closed
subgroups of G with Ki+1 being properly contained in Ki. Since G is compact, so
are the Ki. By the Theorem on Invariance of Domain,17 if Ki and Ki+1 have the same
dimension, then Ki+1 is open in Ki and hence is a union of connected components of
15The quotient πn(X)/π1(X) is the set of orbits of the natural action of π1(X) on πn(X). The latter
was explained prior to Proposition 3.2.9.

Ki. Thus, each Ki+1 must have smaller dimension or fewer connected components
than Ki. Since, by compactness, the number of connected components is ﬁnite, the
sequence must be ﬁnite, and hence must end with the subgroup Kr = {1}. Then, the
representation
ρ1 × · · · × ρr : G →Aut (V1 ⊕· · · ⊕Vr)
has kernel ker(ρ1) ∩· · · ∩ker(ρr) = K1 ∩· · · ∩Kr = {1} and is thus faithful.
♦
From the Stiefel bundles SK(k,l) →GK(k,l) we can construct universal bundles by
taking the direct limits l →∞. To be deﬁnite, let us explain the construction for the
case K = R.
Let R∞be the direct sum of countably many copies of R. Recall that R∞is a
real vector space whose elements are inﬁnite sequences (x1, x2, . . . ) with xi ̸= 0 for
only ﬁnitely many i. It carries an obvious scalar product. Let SR(k, ∞) denote the
set of orthonormal k-frames in R∞and let GR(k, ∞) denote the set of k-dimensional
subspaces of R∞. GR(k, ∞) is known as the inﬁnite Graßmannian. Every element of
Rl can be made into an element of R∞by appending zero entries. This way, we may
identify Rl with a subset of R∞, SR(k,l) with a subset of SR(k, ∞) and GR(k,l)
with a subset of GR(k, ∞). By construction, then Rl is a subset of Rl+1, SR(k,l)
is a subset of SR(k,l + 1) and GR(k,l) is a subset of GR(k,l + 1) for every l. We
topologize SR(k, ∞) and GR(k, ∞) by the ﬁnal topologies deﬁned by the natural
inclusion mappings SR(k,l) →SR(k, ∞) and GR(k,l) →GR(k, ∞), respectively.
That is, a subset of SR(k, ∞) is open iff its intersection with the subset SR(k,l) is open
for all l. An analogous statement holds for GR(k, ∞). Note that SR(k, ∞) may be
identiﬁed with the direct limit of the directed system given by the topological spaces
SR(k,l) and the natural inclusion mappings SR(k,l) →SR(k,l + 1), l = 1, 2, . . . .
Again, a similar statement holds for GR(k, ∞). To make SR(k, ∞) into a principal
O(k)-bundle over GR(k, ∞), we deﬁne a mapping
π : SR(k, ∞) →GR(k, ∞)
(3.4.9)
by assigning to a k-frame in R∞the subspace spanned by this k-frame and a mapping
Ψ : SR(k, ∞) × O(k) →SR(k, ∞)
(3.4.10)
by letting O(k) act on the ﬁrst k entries of the elements of R∞. This is a free action.
Then, denoting the natural projection SR(k,l) →GR(k,l) by π(l) and the action of
O(k) on SR(k,l) by Ψ (l), we have
π↾SR(k,l) = π(l),
Ψ↾SR(k,l)×O(k) = Ψ (l),
(3.4.11)
where we have omitted the natural inclusion mappings. This implies that π is con-
tinuous and that Ψ is a topological right action (Exercise 3.4.4).

3.4 Universal Principal Bundles

Lemma 3.4.15 The tuple

SR(k, ∞), GR(k, ∞), O(k), π, Ψ

is a principal ﬁbre
bundle.
This bundle is referred to as the inﬁnite real Stiefel bundle.
Proof It remains to construct local trivializations. Thus, let W0 ∈GR(k, ∞) be given.
We construct a local section in (3.4.9) at W0 as follows. There exists l0 such that
W0 ∈GR(k,l0). Deﬁne
Ul0 := {W ∈GR(k,l0) : dim PW(W0) = k},
where PW : Rl0 →Rl0 denotes orthogonal projection to W. Choose an orthonormal
basis {ei} in Rl0 whose ﬁrst k elements span W0. For every W ∈Ul0,

PW(e1), . . . , PW(ek), PW ⊥(ek+1), . . . , PW ⊥(el0)

is a basis in Rl0. By applying the standard orthonormalization procedure to this
basis, we obtain an orthonormal basis {ei(W)} whose ﬁrst k elements span W and
thus deﬁne an element sl0(W) belonging to the ﬁbre over W of the Stiefel bun-
dle SR(k,l0) →GR(k,l0). To see that the mapping W →sl0(W) is continuous and
hence a local section in that bundle, we view SR(k,l0) as the homogeneous space
O(l0)/O(l0 −k). Then, sl0(W) is given by the coset of the matrix built from the
columns e1(W), . . . , el0(W). Using that PW(v) depends continuously on W for all
v ∈Rl0, it is not hard to see that each of the vectors ei(W) depends continuously
on W. Hence, so does the corresponding matrix and, therefore, its coset. Now, we
view W0 as an element of GR(k,l0 + 1), deﬁne Ul0+1 in the same way as before and
construct a local section sl0+1 : Ul0+1 →SR(k,l0 + 1) using an orthonormal basis
in Rl0+1 whose ﬁrst l0 elements coincide with the elements of the basis used before.
Then, Ul0 ⊂Ul0+1 and sl0+1 coincides with sl0 on Ul0. Continuing in this way, we
obtain a family of continuous mappings sl : Ul →SR(k,l), l ≥l0, where Ul is an
open neighbourhood of W0 in GR(k,l) and
Ul ⊂Ul+1,
sl+1↾Ul = sl
for all l. By Proposition 3.1.14, this family deﬁnes a continuous mapping s from

l≥l0 Ul to SR(k, ∞) and this mapping is a local section of the projection (3.4.9). ■
In a similar way, one constructs the inﬁnite complex and quaternionic Stiefel bundles.
Theorem 3.4.16 The inﬁnite Stiefel bundle fulﬁls πi

SK(k, ∞)

= 0 for all i. It is
universal for O(k) in case K = R, for U(k) in case K = C, and for Sp(k) in case
K = H.
Proof Again, we apply Theorem 3.4.6. The Graßmannian GR(k,l) admits a canoni-
cal cell decomposition consisting of a total of
l
k

cells [177, 451]. The cell complex
structure so obtained has the property that GR(k,l) is a subcomplex of GR(k,l + 1)

228

for every l > k. It follows that the inﬁnite Graßmannian GR(k, ∞) inherits a natural
CW-complex structure.18 In particular, it is paracompact Hausdorff. To check that
πi

SK(k, ∞)

= 0 for all i, let f : Si →SK(k, ∞) be a continuous mapping. Since
Si and hence f (Si) is compact, there existsl0 such that f (Si) is contained in SK(k,l0)
and hence in SK(k,l) for any l ≥l0. By (3.4.3), for large enough l, f is homotopic
in SK(k,l) to a constant mapping. Hence, it is so in SK(k, ∞).
■
Example 3.4.17
1. For k = 1, Theorem 3.4.16 states that the bundle S∞→KP∞is universal for
O(1) in case K = R, U(1) in case K = C and Sp(1) in case K = H.
2. In view of the fact that πi(SK(k, ∞) = 0 for all i, Corollary 3.4.8 yields that via
the embedding (3.4.5), from the case K = C we obtain the universal bundle
S∞→L∞
r
≡S∞/Zr
for the cyclic group Zr. Here, L∞
r is the inﬁnite lense space. Like in ﬁnite dimen-
sion, L∞
r is a topological principal U(1)-bundle over the inﬁnite complex projec-
tive space CP∞.
3. Corollary 3.4.8 yields the universal bundles
SR(k, ∞) →˜GR(k, ∞) ≡SR(k, ∞)/SO(k),
SC(k, ∞) →˜GC(k, ∞) ≡SC(k, ∞)/SU(k)
for SO(k) and SU(k), respectively. Here, ˜GR(k, ∞) is a topological principal
O(1)-bundle over GR(k, ∞) and ˜GC(k, ∞) is a topological principal U(1)-bundle
over GC(k, ∞).
♦
As in the n-universal case, the existence of universal bundles for the orthogonal
groups entails the existence of universal bundles for all Lie groups with a ﬁnite
number of connected components.
Corollary 3.4.18 Let G be a Lie group with a ﬁnite number of connected compo-
nents, let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G and let K ⊂O(k) via a faithful
orthogonal representation. Then, the principal G-bundle
SR(k, ∞) ×K G →SR(k, ∞)/K
is universal for G. In particular, universal bundles exist for all Lie groups with a
ﬁnite number of connected components.
Proof By Lemma 3.4.7, SR(k, ∞)/K is paracompact Hausdorff of CW-homotopy
type. By the argument used in the proof of Corollary 3.4.12, SR(k, ∞) ×K G is a
deformation retract of SR(k, ∞).
■
18The number of r-cells of this structure coincides with the number of ways to write r as a sum of
at most k positive integers. For a detailed description, see Sect.6 in [451].

3.4 Universal Principal Bundles

Remark 3.4.19 According to Proposition 3.4.3, the classifying space BG may be
chosen to be a CW-complex.
♦
Having constructed universal bundles, we can now show that the universality criterion
given in Theorem 3.4.6 is sharp. By Proposition 3.4.3, every universal G-bundle
E is G-homotopy equivalent to SR(k, ∞) ×K G for some faithful k-dimensional
orthogonal representation of a maximal compact subgroup K. As was shown in the
proof of Theorem 3.4.16, then πi(E) = 0 for all i. Hence, Theorem 3.4.6 implies
the following.
Proposition 3.4.20 Let G be a Lie group with ﬁnitely many connected components.
A topological principal G-bundle E is universal iff πi(E) = 0 for all i.
■
In view of this, Corollary 3.4.8 translates into the following statement.
Corollary 3.4.21 Let G be compact and let H ⊂G be a closed subgroup. Then, the
induced bundle EG →EG/H is universal for H and the quotient space EG/H is
a classifying space for H.
■
Remark 3.4.22 Let G1 and G2 be Lie groups with a ﬁnite number of connected
components. By Proposition 3.4.20, one has
πi(EG1 × EG2) = πi(EG1) × πi(EG2) = 0

Finally, let us summarize the discussion of this section.
Theorem 3.4.23 (Classiﬁcation Theorem) For every Lie group G with a ﬁnite
number of connected components, there exists a topological principal G-bundle
EG →BG with the following property. For every paracompact Hausdorff topolog-
ical space X of CW-homotopy type, the vertical isomorphism classes of topological
principal G-bundles over X are in bijective correspondence with homotopy classes
of continuous mappings f : X →BG. The correspondence is given by assigning to
f the bundle f ∗EG.

The Milnor Construction
In this section, we discuss the Milnor construction, which provides a topological
principal G-bundle whose total space is contractible rather than weakly contractible.
While being less intuitive than the construction of the inﬁnite Stiefel bundles, the
Milnor construction has two advantages. First, it applies to any Hausdorff topological
group. In particular, in the case of a Lie group there is no need to assume a ﬁnite
number of connected components. Second, it classiﬁes topological principal bundles
over all paracompact Hausdorff spaces, and not just those of CW-homotopy type.
In fact, it classiﬁes all principal bundles admitting a system of trivializations with a
subordinate partition of unity. Such bundles are called numerable.
In a ﬁrst step, we construct a topological principal G-bundle G(l) →B(l) for
every positive integer l. Let I = [0, 1]. In what follows, elements of the direct prod-
ucts Gl and I l will be denoted by a = (a1, . . . , al) and t = (t1, . . . , tl), respectively.
The l-join G(l) is the topological quotient of the subset

(a, t) ∈Gl × I l : t1 + · · · + tl = 1

(3.5.1)
of Gl × I l with respect to the equivalence relation
(a, t) ∼(b, u) iff t = u and ai = bi for all i such that ti > 0.

Elements of G(l) will be denoted by [(a, t)]. The free right action of G on Gl × I l

leaves the subset (3.5.1) invariant and hence descends to a topological free right
action Ψ (l) of G on G(l). Let B(l) denote the topological quotient of this action and
let π(l) : G(l) →B(l) denote the natural projection to orbits. To see that Ψ (l) makes
G(l) into a topological principal G-bundle over B(l), it sufﬁces to cover B(l) by local
sections of π(l), that is, by continuous mappings s : U →G(l), where U ⊂B(l) is
open, satisfying π(l) ◦s = idU. For i = 1, . . . ,l, deﬁne subsets

:= {[(a, t)] : ai = 1, ti > 0},
U (l)
i

{[(a, t)] : ti > 0}

of G(l) and B(l), respectively. The subsets U (l)
i
cover B(l). They are open, because
π(l) is an open mapping.19 Since U (l)

S(l)
i

, by restriction, π(l) induces a
continuous surjective mapping
π(l)

It is easy to see that π(l)
i
is injective. We show that it is open. Let [(a, t)] ∈S(l)

have to show that π(l)

in B(l). For an open neighbourhood W of 1 in G and ε > 0, let
V (W, ε) denote the open subset of G(l) obtained by intersecting

(b, s) ∈Gl × I l : bi ∈aiW, si ∈(ti −ε, ti + ε) ∩I

with the subset (3.5.1) and passing to classes with respect to the equivalence relation
(3.5.2). Every neighbourhood of [(a, t)] in S(l)
i
contains a neighbourhood of the form
V (W, ε) ∩S(l)
i
with appropriately chosen W and ε. By continuity of the multipli-
cation and inversion mappings of G, we can ﬁnd an open neighbourhood ˜W ⊂W
of 1 in G such that ˜W ˜W −1 ⊂W. Then, V ( ˜W, ε) is a neighbourhood of [(a, t)] in
G(l) and hence, since π(l)
i
is an open mapping, π(l)
i

V ( ˜W, ε)

is a neighbourhood
of π(l)
i

[(a, t)]

in B(l). Then, so is π(l)
i

V (W, ε) ∩S(l)

This shows that the mappings π(l)

are open and hence homeomorphisms. By inverting
them, we obtain the desired local sections

As a result, for every l, G(l) is a topological principal G-bundle over B(l).
In a second step, we use the bundles G(l) →B(l) to construct a topological
principal bundle G-bundle G(∞) →B(∞) in much the same way as the inﬁnite
Stiefel bundles. Let G∞denote the set of inﬁnite sequences a = (a1, a2, . . . ) with
ai ∈G. Let I ∞denote the set of inﬁnite sequences t = (t1, t2, . . . ) with ti ∈I and
only ﬁnitely many ti > 0. Deﬁne the inﬁnite join G(∞) to be the set of equivalence
classes of the elements of the subset
{(a, t) ∈G∞× I ∞: t1 + t2 + · · · = 1}
(3.5.3)
of G∞× I ∞with respect to the equivalence relation (3.5.2). The free right action
of G on Gl × I l given by

g, (a, t)

→

(a1g, a2g, . . . ), (t1, t2, . . . )

leaves invariant the subset (3.5.3) and hence descends to a free right action Ψ (∞) of G
on the set G(∞). Let B(∞) denote the set of orbits and let π(∞) : G(∞) →B(∞)
denote the natural projection. To equip G(∞) and B(∞) with a topology, we observe
that every element of Gl can be made into an element of G∞by appending an inﬁnite
sequence with entries 1 and every element of I l can be made into an element of I ∞
by appending an inﬁnite sequence with zero entries. It is easy to check that, in
this way, G(l) and B(l) are made into subsets of G(∞) and B(∞), respectively, for
every n. Thus, we can topologize G(∞) and B(∞) by the ﬁnal topologies deﬁned by
the corresponding natural inclusion mappings. These topologies coincide with those
inherited from the ﬁnal topology on G∞× I ∞induced by the family of natural
inclusion mappings Gl × I l →G∞× I ∞by taking subsets and quotients. Then,
the obvious relations
π(∞)
↾G(l) = π(l),
Ψ (∞)
↾G×G(l) = Ψ (l),
holding for all l ≥i, imply that π(∞) and Ψ (∞) are continuous. To construct local
sections of the projection π(∞) : G(∞) →B(∞), for every positive integer i we
deﬁne a subset
Ui := π(∞)
{[(a, t)] ∈G(∞) : ti > 0}

of B(∞) and a mapping
si : Ui →G(∞)
by assigning to π(∞)
[(a, t)]

the unique representative with ai = 1. This mapping
is continuous, because its restriction to U (l)
i
coincides with s(l)
i
for all l ≥i, and it
satisﬁes π(∞) ◦si = idUi. Since the subsets Ui cover B(∞), this shows that G(∞)
is a topological principal G-bundle over B(∞).

3.5 The Milnor Construction
233
Theorem 3.5.1 The assignment (3.4.1) induced by the topological principal G-
bundle G(∞) over B(∞) is a bijection for all paracompact Hausdorff spaces X.
Proof First, assume that we are given a topological principal G-bundle π : P →X.
We aim at constructing a classifying mapping f : X →B(∞).
By applying Lemma 3.3.2 to the bundle P × I, we ﬁnd a locally ﬁnite open
covering {Ui : i = 1, 2, . . . } of X such that P is trivial over Ui for each i. Since X
is paracompact, there exists a subordinate partition of unity {ϕi : i = 1, 2, . . . }. That
is, supp(ϕi) ⊂Ui for all i.
Using a system of local trivializations {χi}, we can deﬁne the associated map-
pings κi := prG ◦χi : π−1(Ui) →G. Extending them to all of P by assigning to
p /∈π−1(Ui) the value 1, we can deﬁne a mapping
P →G(∞),
p →

κ1(p), κ2(p), . . .

,

ϕ1 ◦π(p), ϕ2 ◦π(p), . . .

.
It is easy to see that this mapping is continuous and a principal G-bundle morphism.
According to Remark 1.1.9/1, the projection f : X →B(∞) yields the desired clas-
sifying mapping.
Conversely, let f0, f1 : X →B(∞) be continuous mappings such that there exists
anisomorphismλ : f ∗
0 G(∞) →f ∗
1 G(∞)andlet Fi : f ∗
i G(∞) →G(∞),i = 0, 1,
denote the corresponding natural morphisms. To prove that f0 and f1 are homotopic,
we deﬁne mappings F± : G(∞) →G(∞) by
F−

Since, for every l, the restriction of F± to G(l) is a composition of the natural inclu-
sion mappings G(l) →G(2l) and G(2l) →G(∞) with an intermediate mapping
G(2l) →G(2l) induced by a simultaneous permutation of the entries of the elements
of G2l × I 2l, the mappings F± are continuous. In fact, they are principal G-bundle
morphisms. We show that they are homotopic through principal G-bundle morphisms
to idG(∞), and hence that their projections f ± : B(∞) →B(∞) are homotopic to
idB(∞). Consider the mappings

in case of H +. By an explicit calculation one can check that the deﬁnition is consistent
for s = 2k, where n can be chosen as k or as k −1. Continuity follows by observing
that, for every l, the restriction of H ± to G(l) × I is a composition of a certain
mapping G(l) × I →G(2l), which can be read off from the deﬁnition of H ± and
which is obviously continuous, with the natural inclusion mapping G(2l) →G(∞).
Since H ± is equivariant with respect to the action of G, it yields the desired homotopy
through principal G-bundle morphisms between F± and idG(∞).
As a result of these considerations, it sufﬁces to show that f −◦f0 is homotopic
to f + ◦f1. For that purpose, we deﬁne a mapping H : f ∗
0 G(∞) × I →G(∞) by
H(x, s) :=

if ti = 0 or ui = 0 (sothatai or bi areindeterminate), then, respectively, (1 −s)ti = 0
or sui = 0. To see that H is continuous, we write it as a composition of the mapping
(F−◦F0) × (F+ ◦F1 ◦λ) : G(∞) →G(∞) × G(∞)
with the mapping G(∞) × G(∞) →G(∞) which assigns to a pair

and check that the restriction to G(l) × G(l) of the latter mapping is continuous
for all l. Since H is equivariant, it yields a homotopy through principal G-bundle
morphisms between F−◦F0 and F+ ◦F1 ◦λ and hence a homotopy between the
respective projections, that is between f −◦f0 and f + ◦f1. This completes the proof
of the theorem.

Remark 3.5.2
1. From the construction of classifying mappings used in the proof of Theorem
3.5.1, it is clear that none of the topological principal G-bundles G(l) →B(l)
can be n-universal for some n > 1, in contrast to the Stiefel bundles.
2. Let G be a Hausdorff topological group. On the one hand, the principal G-bundle
G(∞) →B(∞) is numerable, because for i = 1, 2, . . . , the assignment of ti to
[(a, t)] descends to a continuous function fi on B(∞). Clearly, the family of these
functions is a partition of unity. Moreover, G(∞) is trivial over Ui := f −1

(0, 1],
with trivialization given by

On the other hand, it is not hard to see that the proofs of the Covering Homotopy
Theorem 3.3.1 and of Theorem 3.5.1 work for numerable principal G-bundles
as well. As a consequence, the assignment (3.4.1) induced by G(∞) →B(∞)
is well deﬁned for all topological spaces X and it maps [X, B(∞)] bijectively
onto the isomorphism classes of numerable topological principal G-bundles over
X. Thus, for an arbitrary Hausdorff topological group G, and in particular for a
Lie group, the principal G-bundle G(∞) →B(∞) is universal in the realm of
numerable principal G-bundles.
3. The total space G(∞) is contractible [628, Theorem 14.4.6].

Classiﬁcation of Smooth Principal Bundles
In this section, we use the classiﬁcation result for topological principal bundles
to complete the classiﬁcation of smooth principal bundles. In addition, from the
classiﬁcation of principal bundles, we derive the classiﬁcation of vector bundles.
We start with showing that for a given Lie group G, every topological principal G-
bundle over a smooth manifold admits a compatible smooth structure. The argument
is based on the following fact.
Theorem 3.6.1 For smooth manifolds M and N, every continuous mapping M →
N is homotopic to a smooth mapping.
Proof This is an immediate consequence of the fact that C∞(M, N) is dense in
C0(M, N) in the strong topology20 and hence in the weaker compact-open topology
[303, Theorem 2.2.6].
■
Combining this with the observation that the n-universal G-bundle provided by
Corollary 3.4.12 happens to be smooth, we obtain the following result.
Proposition 3.6.2 Let G be a Lie group and let M be a smooth manifold. Every
topological principal G-bundle over M is continuously vertically isomorphic to a
smooth principal G-bundle over M.
Thus, every topological principal G-bundle over a smooth manifold admits a com-
patible smooth structure.
20For given f ∈C0(M, N), a basis for the neighbourhoods of f in the strong topology is given
by the following subsets. Let {(Ui, κi) : i ∈I} be a locally ﬁnite atlas on M, let {Ki : i ∈I} be
a family of compact subsets of M satisfying Ki ⊂Ui for all i, let {(Vi, κi) : i ∈I} be an atlas
on N satisfying f (Ki) ⊂Vi for all i, and let {εi : i ∈I} be a sequence of positive numbers. The
neighbourhoodof f deﬁnedbythesedataconsistsofallmappings g : M →N suchthat g(Ki) ⊂Vi
and supKi |ρi ◦g ◦κi −ρi ◦f ◦κi| < εi for all i ∈I. See [303, Sect.2.1] for details.

Proof According to Corollary 3.4.12, there exists a smooth principal G-bundle
E →B such that the mapping [M, B] →PFB(G, M) deﬁned by f →f ∗E is a
bijection for M. Hence, for every topological principal G-bundle P over M, there
exists a continuous mapping f : M →B such that P is vertically isomorphic to the
topological principal G-bundle f ∗E. By Theorem 3.6.1, f is homotopic to a smooth
mapping g : M →B. Hence, P is continuously vertically isomorphic to the smooth
principal G-bundle g∗E.
■
Next, we show that smooth principal G-bundles over M are vertically isomorphic if
so are their underlying topological principal bundles. The crucial step is the following
smoothening result.
Lemma 3.6.3 Let E be a smooth ﬁbre bundle over a smooth manifold M. If E admits
a continuous section, then it admits a smooth section.
Proof Let F be the typical ﬁbre of E. Let ϕ0 be a continuous section in E. By
Lemma 3.3.2 and Remark 3.3.3, we can choose a locally ﬁnite open covering {Ui :
i = 1, 2, . . . } of M such that E is trivial over each Ui. Then, there exists a closed
covering {Bi : i = 1, 2, . . . } such that Bi ⊂Ui; for example given by the supports
of a partition of unity subordinate to the Ui. Since manifolds are normal spaces, for
every i, there exists an open subset Wi such that Bi ⊂Wi and Wi ⊂Ui. Starting
with ϕ0, by induction on i, we will construct continuous sections ϕi of E which are
smooth on a neighbourhood ˜Ui of ˜Bi := i
j=1 B j and coincide with ϕi outside Wi.
Clearly, ϕ0 may be chosen to be smooth. Thus, assume that we have constructed ϕi.
Since E is trivial over Ui+1, the restriction ϕi ↾Ui+1 is represented by a continuous
mapping fi : Ui+1 →F which is smooth on ˜Ui ∩Ui+1. We choose a countable atlas
for F and cover Ui+1 by open subsets Vα, α = 1, 2, . . . , such that fi(Vα) is contained
in the domain of a single chart of that atlas on F and such that either Vα ⊂Wi+1 or
Vα ∩Bi+1 = ∅; see Fig.3.1. Now, we apply to fi the usual smoothening procedure
by induction on α from the proof that C∞(Ui+1, F) is dense in C0(Ui+1, F) in the

3.6 Classiﬁcation of Smooth Principal Bundles
237
strong topology,21 with the following modiﬁcation. If Vα ∩Bi+1 = ∅, the mapping is
left unchanged in step α. This way, we obtain a continuous mapping fi+1 : Ui+1 →F
which is smooth in a neighbourhood ˜Vi+1 of Bi+1 and coincides with fi+1 outside
Wi+1. This mapping corresponds to a continuous section ˜ϕi+1 in E↾Ui+1 which is
smooth on ˜Vi+1 and coincides with ϕi on Ui+1 \ Wi+1. It follows that
ϕi+1(m) :=

ϕi(m)
| m ∈M \ Wi+1,
˜ϕi+1(m) | m ∈Ui+1
deﬁnes a continuous section in E which is smooth on the neighbourhood ˜Ui+1 :=
˜Ui ∪˜Vi+1 of ˜Bi+1 and which coincides with ϕi outside Wi+1. This completes the
proof of the existence of the sections ϕi.
Now,letm ∈M.Since Wi ⊂Ui foralli andsincethecovering{Ui : i = 1, 2, . . . }
is locally ﬁnite, there exists a neighbourhood V of m in M such that V ∩Wi is
nonempty for only ﬁnitely many i. Out of these, let i1, . . . , ir be the numbers for
which m /∈Wi. Then, ˜V := V \ (Wi1 ∪· · · ∪Wir ) is an open neighbourhood of m.
This shows that the function
m →i(m) := max{i ∈N : m ∈Wi}
is well deﬁned and locally constant. We deﬁne a section ϕ of E by
ϕ(m) := ϕi(m)(m),
m ∈M.
Since the function m →i(m) is locally constant, ϕ coincides with ϕi(m) on some
neighbourhood of any m. On the other hand, since Bi ⊂Wi and m /∈Wi for all
i > i(m), every m belongs to some Bi with i ≤i(m) and hence to ˜Bi(m). Since ϕi(m)
is smooth in a neighbourhood of ˜Bi(m), it follows that ϕ is smooth in a neighbourhood
of m for every m ∈M. This proves the lemma.

Let P and Q be smooth principal G-bundles over M. By Corollary 1.2.7, smooth ver-
tical isomorphisms P →Q correspond bijectively to smooth sections of the smooth
ﬁbre bundle P ×G,M Q over M. An analogous statement holds for continuous ver-
tical isomorphisms and continuous sections of this bundle. Hence, Lemma 3.6.3
implies
Proposition 3.6.4 Let G be a Lie group, let M be a smooth manifold and let P and
Q be smooth principal G-bundles over M. If P and Q are vertically isomorphic as
topological principal G-bundles, they are vertically isomorphic as smooth principal
G-bundles.
■
Remark 3.6.5 Using Proposition 1.2.6, one can prove a similar result for
G-morphisms P →Q, where P and Q are smooth principal G-bundles over dif-
ferent manifolds. Since we do not need this, we leave it to the interested reader to
21See, for example, [303, Theorem 2.2.6].

Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
work out a proof. The problem is that such morphisms need not be isomorphisms,
so that one has to make sure that the smoothened morphism can be chosen to be an
isomorphism. This requires the following arguments.
1. The smoothened section of Lemma 3.6.3 can be chosen arbitrarily close to the
original section in the strong topology induced from C0(M, P ×G Q).
2. The assignment of morphisms to sections is continuous in the strong topologies
induced from C0(M, P ×G Q) and C0(P, Q), respectively.
The assertion then follows from the fact that the subset of homeomorphisms is open
in C0(P, Q) in the strong topology [303, Theorem 1.1.7].
♦
Now, we can prove that vertical isomorphism classes of smooth principal G-bundles
over a smooth manifold M correspond bijectively to vertical isomorphism classes of
topological principal G-bundles over M.
Theorem 3.6.6 Let G be a Lie group and let M be a smooth manifold. Forgetting
about the smooth structure deﬁnes a bijection from the set of vertical isomorphism
classes of smooth principal G-bundles over M onto the set of vertical isomorphism
classes of topological principal G-bundles over M.
Proof Forgetting about the smooth structure clearly deﬁnes an assignment on the
level of vertical isomorphism classes. By Proposition 3.6.2, this assignment is sur-
jective. By Proposition 3.6.4, it is injective.
■
Combining this with Corollary 3.4.12, we obtain that, given a smooth manifold
of dimension dim(M) ≤n, every n-universal bundle E →B for G establishes a
bijection between vertical isomorphism classes of smooth principal G-bundles over
M and homotopy classes of continuous mappings M →B. However, since smooth
n-universal bundles exist, it makes sense to use them for directly classifying smooth
principal G-bundles in terms of smooth classifying mappings, without taking the
detour through topological bundles.
Theorem 3.6.7 (Classiﬁcation Theorem) Let G be a Lie group, let E →B be an
n-universal bundle for G which is smooth, and let M be a smooth manifold with
dim(M) ≤n. Then, the assignment of f ∗E to f : M →B induces a bijection from
the set of (continuous) homotopy classes of smooth mappings to vertical isomorphism
classes of smooth principal G-bundles over M.
Proof The assignment induces a mapping of the classes: if f, g : M →B are smooth
mappings which are homotopic through a continuous homotopy, then f ∗E and g∗E
are vertically isomorphic as topological principal bundles. By Proposition 3.6.4, they
are isomorphic as smooth principal bundles then.
The induced mapping is surjective: let P be a smooth principal G-bundle over
M. Since E is n-universal, P is vertically isomorphic, as a topological principal
G-bundle, to f ∗E for some continuous mapping f : M →B. By Theorem 3.6.1, f
is homotopic to a smooth mapping g : M →B. By Corollary 3.3.5, then P and g∗E

3.6 Classiﬁcation of Smooth Principal Bundles

are vertically isomorphic as topological principal G-bundles. By Proposition 3.6.4,
they are vertically isomophic as smooth principal G-bundles then.
The induced mapping is injective: let f, g : M →B be smooth mappings. If f ∗E
and g∗E are vertically isomorphic as smooth principal G-bundles, they are vertically
isomorphic as topological principal G-bundles. Since E is n-universal, then f and
g are homotopic.
■
To conclude this section, we use the classiﬁcation results for principal bundles
obtained above to classify vector bundles.
Let M be a smooth manifold and let k be a positive integer. As in Example 1.2.9/2,
for K = R, C or H, let UK(k) denote, respectively, the group O(k), U(k) or Sp(k).
Given a principal UK(k)-bundle P over M, one has the associated K-vector bundle
of rank k given by P ×UK(k) Kk, where UK(k) acts on Kk via the basic representation.
This bundle carries a natural ﬁbre metric, induced from the natural scalar product on
Kk.
Theorem 3.6.8 For K = R, C, H, the assignment P →P ×UK(k) Kk induces a
bijection between the isomorphism classes of principal UK(k)-bundles over M and
the isomorphism classes of K-vector bundles of rank k over M.
Proof By Proposition 1.2.8/3, the assignment P →P ×UK(k) Kk induces a mapping
of isomorphism classes. By Example 1.2.9/2, the induced mapping is surjective.
The induced mapping is injective: it sufﬁces to show that for every principal
UK(k)-bundle P over M, P is isomorphic to the orthonormal frame bundle O(E)
of the associated K-vector bundle E = P ×UK(k) Kk, equipped with its natural ﬁbre
metric. Consider the mapping
P →O(E),
p →

[(p, e1)], . . . , [(p, ek)]

,
(3.6.1)
where e1, . . . , ek are the elements of the standard basis of Kk. It is injective, because
[(p, e1)] = [(q, e1)] implies p = q. It is surjective, because every ordered orthonor-
mal basis in a ﬁbre of P ×UK(k) Kk is of the form [(p, a j ie j)] = [(Ψa(p), ei)] for
some p ∈P and some a ∈UK(k) and hence is the image of Ψa(p). Finally, the local
representative of (3.6.1) with respect to the local trivialization of P induced by a
local section s and a local trivialization of P ×UK(k) Kk induced by the local frame
m →

s(m), ei

is given by the identical mapping. Thus, (3.6.1) is an isomorphism
of principal UK(k)-bundles over M. This proves the theorem.
■
Combining Theorem 3.6.8 with Theorems 3.6.6 and 3.6.7, as well as Theorems 3.4.10
and 3.4.16, we obtain the following.
Corollary 3.6.9 Let K = R, C or H, let M be a smooth manifold of dimension n,
let k be a positive integer and let d = dimR(K).
1. For everyl ≥n+2
d
+ k −1, the assignment f →f ∗
SK(k,l) ×UK(k) Kk
induces
a bijection between homotopy classes of smooth mappings M →GK(k,l) and
isomorphism classes of smooth K-vector bundles over M of rank k.

2. Forgetting about the smooth structure induces a bijection from the set of iso-
morphism classes of smooth K-vector bundles over M of rank k onto the set of
isomorphism classes of topological K-vector bundles over M of rank k.
3. The assignment f →f ∗
SK(k, ∞) ×UK(k) Kk
induces a bijection between
homotopy classes of continuous mappings M →GK(k, ∞) and isomorphism
classes of topological K-vector bundles over M of rank k.
■
Remark 3.6.10
1. According to point 3 of Corollary 3.6.9, for every topological K-vector
bundle E of rank k over B, there exists a classifying mapping, that is, a con-
tinuous mapping f : B →GK(k, ∞) such that E is vertically isomorphic to
f ∗
SK(k, ∞) ×UK(k) Kk
, and this mapping is unique up to homotopy. According
to Proposition 1.2.8/4, up to homotopy, a principal UK(k)-bundle P has the same
classifying mapping as the associated vector bundle P ×UK(k) Kk, and a K-vector
bundle of rank k has the same classifying mapping as its orthonormal frame
bundle O(E) with respect to some chosen positive deﬁnite ﬁbre metric.
2. The notions of n-universal principal bundle and universal principal bundle carry
over in an obvious way to vector bundles of a prescribed rank. Using this, points
1 and 3 of Corollary 3.6.9 may be restated as follows.
1. For every l ≥n+2
d
+ k −1, the associated vector bundle SK(k,l) ×UK(k) Kk
is n-universal for K-vector bundles of rank k.
3. The associated vector bundle SK(k, ∞) ×UK(k) Kk is universal for K-vector
bundles of rank k.
If, on the other hand, one just wants to classify vector bundles, one may skip the
detour through principal bundles and construct smooth n-universal vector bundles
EK(k,l) →GK(k,l) of rank k directly by deﬁning
EK(k,l) := {(W, v) ∈GK(k,l) × Kk : v ∈W},
where l ≥n+2
d
+ k −1. In complete analogy with the construction of the inﬁnite
Stiefel bundles, by taking the direct limit l →∞, one obtains a universal topo-
logical vector bundle EK(k, ∞) →GK(k, ∞) of rank k, see Sect.1.2 in [287].

Classifying Mappings Associated with Lie Group
Homomorphisms
Throughout this section, let G, H be Lie groups with ﬁnitely many connected com-
ponents and let X be a paracompact Hausdorff space of CW-homotopy type. We
choose universal bundles EG →BG and EH →BH.

3.7 Classifying Mappings Associated with Lie Group Homomorphisms
241
Given a Lie group homomorphism λ : G →H, we can form the associated bundle
EG[λ] = EG ×G H, cf. (1.2.8). Right translation on H deﬁnes an action of H on
EG[λ] and this action makes EG[λ] into a topological principal H-bundle over BG.
Deﬁnition 3.7.1 ThemappingBλ : BG →BH associatedwithλisdeﬁnedtobethe
classifying mapping of the principal H-bundle EG[λ], that is, the mapping fulﬁlling
EG[λ] ∼= (Bλ)∗(EH).
(3.7.1)
Clearly, the mapping Bλ is determined up to homotopy. In what follows, we discuss
its properties.
Proposition 3.7.2 Let λ : G →H be a Lie group homomorphism.
1. Let P be a topological principal G-bundle over X and let f be a classifying
mapping for P. Then, Bλ ◦f is a classifying mapping for P[λ].
2. Let Q be a topological principal H-bundle over X and let g be a classifying
mapping for Q. The vertical isomorphism classes of topological principal G-
bundles P over X having the property that P[λ] is vertically isomorphic to Q
correspond bijectively to the homotopy classes of mappings f : X →BG such
that Bλ ◦f is homotopic to g.
Proof 1. By deﬁnition of Bλ, the principal H-bundle (Bλ)∗EH over BG is ver-
tically isomorphic to EG[λ]. Combining this with Proposition 1.2.5, we obtain the
vertical isomorphisms
(Bλ ◦f )∗EH ∼= f ∗(Bλ)∗EH ∼= f ∗(EG[λ]) ∼= ( f ∗EG)[λ] ∼= P[λ].
2. It sufﬁces to show that for a continuous mapping f : X →BG, the composi-
tion Bλ ◦f is homotopic to g iff ( f ∗EG)[λ] is vertically isomorphic to Q. By point
1, Bλ ◦f is a classifying mapping for ( f ∗EG)[λ]. Hence, the assertion follows from
the universality of EH.
■
Point 2 of Proposition 3.7.2 applies in particular to Lie subgroup embeddings.
Corollary 3.7.3 The vertical isomorphism classes of reductions of a topological
principal H-bundle Q over X to a Lie subgroup λ : G →H correspond bijectively
to the homotopy classes of mappings f : X →BG such that Bλ ◦f is a classifying
mapping for Q.
■
Next, we discuss the functorial properties of Bλ.
Proposition 3.7.4 Up to homotopy, the following holds true.
1. For λ1 : G →H and λ2 : H →K, one has B(λ2 ◦λ1) = Bλ2 ◦Bλ1.
2. One has B idG = idBG. More generally, if λ is an inner automorphism of G, then
Bλ = idBG.
3. For the constant homomorphism, Bλ is homotopic to a constant mapping.

Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
Proof 1. By deﬁnition, B(λ2 ◦λ1) is a classifying mapping for EG[λ2◦λ1]. By Propo-
sition 3.7.2/1, Bλ2 ◦Bλ1 is a classifying mapping for

EG[λ1][λ2]. We leave it to the
reader to check that the mapping
EG × K →(EG × H) × K,
(y, k) →

(y, 1H), k

(3.7.2)
descends to a vertical K-morphism, and hence isomorphism, from EG[λ2◦λ1] onto

EG[λ1][λ2] (Exercise 3.7.1).
2. The action mapping Ψ : EG × G →EG descends to a vertical isomorphism
EG[idG] →EG. More generally, let λ be given by conjugation by b ∈G, that is,
λ(a) = bab−1. We leave it to the reader to prove that the mapping EG × G →EG
deﬁned by (y, g) →Ψb−1g(y) descends to a vertical isomorphism from EG[λ] onto
EG.
3. The mapping π × idH : EG × H →BG × H descends to a vertical isomor-
phism EG[λ] →BG × H.
■
In the special case where λ : G →H is a Lie subgroup embedding, Bλ inherits a
bundle structure.
Proposition 3.7.5 Let G be a compact Lie group.
1. If λ : H →G is a Lie subgroup embedding, then the classifying mapping Bλ :
BH →BG can be realized as the projection in the topological ﬁbre bundle
EG/H →BG with typical ﬁbre G/H.
2. If λ : H →G is a normal Lie subgroup embedding, then BH can be realized as a
topological principal bundle over BG with structure group G/H and projection
Bλ. This bundle has classifying mapping Bp, where p : G →G/H is the natural
projection.
Proof 1. By Corollary 3.4.21, the induced bundle EG →EG/H, with H acting
via λ, is universal for H. Hence, EH = EG up to H-homotopy equivalence and
BH = EG/H up to homotopy equivalence. Moreover, the induced projection f :
BH ≡EG/H →BG is a topological ﬁbre bundle with typical ﬁbre G/H. To see
that f realizes Bλ, it sufﬁces to check that the principal G-bundles f ∗EG and EH [λ]
are vertically isomorphic. We leave it to the reader to show that the mapping
EG × G →BH × EG,
(y, h) →

π(y), Ψh(y)

(3.7.3)
where π : EG →EG/H ≡BH denotes projection to orbits and Ψ denotes the
action of G on EG, induces a vertical isomorphism EH [λ] →f ∗EG (Exercise 3.7.2).
2. The ﬁrst assertion follows from point 1 by recalling that, in the present case,
the induced projection EG/H →BG has the structure of a principal bundle with
structure group G/H. For the second assertion, we observe that the mapping EG →
EG × (G/H) descends to a vertical G/H-morphism, and hence isomorphism, from
BH to EG[p].

3.7 Classifying Mappings Associated with Lie Group Homomorphisms
243
Proposition 3.7.6 Let P, Q be topological principal bundles over topological
spaces BP, BQ with structure groups G, H, respectively, and let F : P →Q be a
morphism with Lie group homomorphism λ : G →H and projection f : BP →BQ.
1. If fP : BP →BG and fQ : BQ →BH are classifying mappings for P and Q,
respectively, then fQ ◦f is homotopic to Bλ ◦fP. That is, the diagram

2. If f is a homeomorphism, then the mapping P × H →Q, (p, h) →Ψ Q
h

F(p)

descends to a principal H-bundle isomorphism P[λ] →Q projecting to f .
Proof 1. Consider the associated principal H-bundle P[λ]. One can check that the
mapping
P × H →BP × Q,
(p, h) →

πP(p), Ψ Q
h (F(p))

(3.7.4)
takes values in f ∗Q ⊂BP × Q and that it descends to a vertical isomorphism of
principal H-bundles from P[λ] to f ∗Q (Exercise 3.7.3). Hence, according to Propo-
sition 3.7.2/1, Bλ ◦fP : BP →BH is a classifying mapping for f ∗Q. It is therefore
homotopic to fQ ◦f .
2. The mapping under consideration is the composition of (3.7.4), viewed as a
mapping to f ∗Q ⊂BP × Q, with the natural principal bundle morphism f ∗Q →Q
given by projecting to the second entry. Since the latter is an isomorphism if f is a
homeomorphism, the assertion follows.
■
Finally, recall from Remark 3.4.22 that the universal bundle and the classifying space
for a direct product G1 × G2 of Lie groups with ﬁnitely many connected components
may be realized by the direct products EG1 × EG2 and BG1 × BG2, respectively.
Under this assumption, we have the following.
Proposition 3.7.7 Up to homotopy, the following holds true.
1. For i = 1, 2, let Gi,
Hi
be Lie groups with ﬁnitely many connected
components and let λi : Gi →Hi be Lie group homomorphisms. Then,
B(λ1 × λ2) = Bλ1 × Bλ2.
2. For the diagonal mappings ΔG : G →G × G and ΔBG : BG →BG × BG, one
has BΔG = ΔBG.
Proof 1. By Proposition 1.2.5/3, we have the vertical isomorphisms

Universal Connections
In this section, we extend the discussion of n-universal objects from bundles to
bundles with connections.
Deﬁnition 3.8.1 A connection ω0 on an n-universal principal G-bundle E →B is
called n-universal if for every connection ω on a principal G-bundle P →M with
dim(M) ≤n there exists a G-morphism ϑ : P →E such that ω = ϑ∗ω0.
Necessarily, the projection of ϑ is then a classifying mapping for P. We will proceed
in two steps.
(a) We present the classical result of Narasimhan and Ramanan [476] for compact
Liegroups,seealso[560]and,foranalgebraicreformulation,[396].Inparticular,
the natural connections on the Stiefel bundles, given in Example 1.3.20, provide
n-universal connections for the classical compact Lie groups.

3.8 Universal Connections
245
(b) For the case of an arbitrary Lie group, there are at least two different approaches.
The one of Narasimhan and Ramanan [477] is, similarly to their method used
in the compact case, by patching together local solutions. The one presented in
[81] is more geometric and uses the tautological connection on the section jet
bundle of an n-universal G-bundle.22 This is the approach we follow here.
Unfortunately, the result in the compact case seemingly cannot be obtained directly
as a special case of (b).
To start with, recall the canonical connection ωc on the Stiefel bundle
SK(k, n) ∼= UK(n)/UK(n −k) →GK(k, n) ∼= UK(n)/(UK(n −k) × UK(k)) ,
cf. Example 1.3.20. According to (1.3.19), in terms of the matrix-valued function u
which assigns to the k-frame built from uα = a j αe j the (n × k)-matrix a j α, it reads
ωc = u†du.
(3.8.1)
By Theorem 3.4.10, the Stiefel bundles are n-universal for the classical compact Lie
groups. We will show that ωc provides universal connections for these groups. In
our presentation we follow [476]. To be deﬁnite, we restrict attention to the unitary
group, that is, K = C. The starting point is the following technical lemma. For the
proof we refer to Sect.3 in [476].
Lemma 3.8.2 Let U ⊂Rn be an open subset and let V ⊂U be a relatively compact
subset whose closure is contained in U. Let l = (2n + 1)k2. For every 1-form α with
values in u(k), there exist smooth mappings f1, . . . , fl : V →Mk(C) such that
l
i=1
f †
i fi = 1k,
l

i d fi = α.
■
Lemma 3.8.3 Let P be a principal U(k)-bundle over a manifold M of dimension
≤n and let ω be a connection form on P. Let V ⊂M be a relatively compact open
subset whose closure is contained in a coordinate neighbourhood U over which P
is trivial. Then, there exists a bundle morphism ϑ : PV →SC(k,lk) such that
ϑ∗ωc = ω↾PV ,
where PV is the restriction of P to V .
Proof Recallthatthematrix-valuedfunctionu onSC(k,lk)mentionedaboverealizes
SC(k,lk) as the subset of the vector space of complex (lk) × k-matrices which is

deﬁned by the relation A†A = 1k. In this realization, the action of the structure group
U(k) is given by right multiplication.
Let π : P →M denote the canonical projection. Choose a local trivialization of
P over U, let κ : PU →U(k) be the corresponding equivariant mapping and let s :
U →P be the associated local section. Consider the local representative A := s∗ω.
By Lemma 3.8.2, using a chart on U, we can ﬁnd smooth mappings f1, . . . , fl :

so that ϑ takes values in SC(k,lk), indeed. It is easy to see that ϑ is equivariant
and hence a morphism of principal U(k)-bundles. Using (3.8.1) and κ ◦s = 1k, we
ﬁnally compute
s∗ϑ∗ωc = s∗(ϑ†dϑ) = (ϑ ◦s)†d(ϑ ◦s) =

Hence, ϑ∗ωc = ω over V .

Theorem 3.8.4 Let P be a principal U(k)-bundle over a manifold M of dimension
≤n and let m := (n + 1)kl. For every connection form ω on P, there exists a bundle
morphism ϑ : P →SC(k, m) such that ϑ∗ωc = ω.
Proof According to [480], there exists an open covering {W1, . . . , Wn+1} of M such
that each Wi decomposes into a disjoint union of relatively compact open subsets Vi j
whose closure is contained in a coordinate neighbourhood over which P is trivial. To
each Vi j, we can apply Lemma 3.8.3. For each ﬁxed i, the resulting U(k)-morphisms
ϑi j : PVi j →SC(k,lk) combine to U(k)-morphisms ϑi : PVi →SC(k,lk) satisfying
ω↾PVi = ϑ∗
i ωc. Extend the ϑi arbitrarily to smooth mappings from P to the space of

Corollary 3.8.5 Let G be a compact Lie group and let P be a principal G-bundle.
There exists a principal G-bundle E →B and a connection form ω0 on E such
that for every connection form ω on P, there exists a bundle morphism ϑ : P →E
fulﬁlling ϑ∗ω0 = ω.
Proof By [105, Theorem 4.1], G admits a faithful unitary representation on Ck for
some k. Let λ : G →U(k) be the corresponding Lie subgroup embedding. Consider
the principal U(k)-bundle P[λ] and let j : P →P[λ] be the induced mapping, given
by j(p) = [(p, 1k)]. By Corollary 1.3.14, there exists a unique connection ω1 on
P[λ] such that j∗ω1 = dλ ◦ω. By Theorem 3.8.4, there exists a positive integer
m and a U(k)-morphism ϑ1 : P[λ] →SC(k, m) such that ϑ∗
1 ωc = ω1. Via λ, the
structure group G acts freely and properly on E := SC(k, m) and thus turns E into
a principal G-bundle over the quotient manifold B := E/G. On the one hand, there
exists a unique G-morphism ϑ : P →E satisfying ϑ1 ◦j = ϑ. On the other hand,
since U(k) is compact, we have a reductive decomposition u(k) = dλ(g) ⊕m. Let
prg : u(k) →dλ(g) →g denote the corresponding projection. One can check that
ω0 := prg ◦ωc is a connection form on the principal G-bundle E →B (Exercise
3.8.1, cf. also Example 1.3.19). We compute
ϑ∗ω0 = prg ◦(ϑ∗ωc) = prg ◦( j∗ϑ∗
1 ωc) = prg ◦( j∗ω1) = prg ◦dλ ◦ω = ω.
■
Now, we turn to the discussion of universal connections for arbitrary Lie groups.
Let P be a principal G-bundle over the base manifold M with action Ψ and
projection π. By point 2 of Remark 1.3.3, every connection ω on P deﬁnes a hor-
izontal lift ℓω
p : Tπ(p)M →Tp P for every p ∈P. It is evident that the assignment
p →ℓω
p deﬁnes a smooth section in the vector bundle Hom(π∗TM, TP) over P and
that this section takes values in the subset

τ : Hom(π∗TM, TP) →End(π∗TM),
τ(ℓp) := π′
p ◦ℓp.
According to Example 2.7.7 of Part I, ker τ is a vertical vector subbundle of
Hom(π∗TM, TP) of rank r = dim(M) · dim(G). It is not hard to see that, for every
p ∈P, the subset J1
p P is an afﬁne subspace of Hom

(π∗TM)p, Tp P

with trans-
lation vector space given by the linear subspace ker τp. Given p0 ∈P, we ﬁnd an
open neighbourhood U ⊂P, a local frame {s1, . . . , sr} in ker τ over U ⊂P and a
local section s in Hom(π∗TM, TP) over U taking values in J1P (for example, the
section deﬁned by a connection on P). Then, the mapping
ψ : U × Rr →π−1
1 (U),
ψ(p, x) := s(p) +
r

i=1
xisi(p),
(3.8.3)
is a bijection. We leave it to the reader to check that the transition mappings between
two such bijections are smooth (Exercise 3.8.2). Hence, the collection of mappings
(3.8.3) deﬁnes on J1P the structure of a smooth manifold. With respect to this struc-
ture, J1P endowed with the projection π1 : J1P →P is a ﬁbre bundle with typical
ﬁbre Rr. More precisely, it is an afﬁne bundle with translation vector bundle ker τ
and an afﬁne subbundle of Hom(π∗TM, TP). Note that J1P is a concrete realization
of the ﬁrst jet manifold of sections in P. It is therefore referred to as the ﬁrst section
jet bundle of P.
Next, we are going to endow J1P with the structure of a principal G-bundle. Recall
from Example 6.1.2/5 of Part I that the action Ψ of G on P induces an action of G
on TP by the tangent mappings (Ψa)′, a ∈G. Moreover, G acts on the vector bundle
π∗TM by

a, (p, X)

→

Ψa(p), X

. Since both these actions cover Ψ , they induce
a smooth action of G on Hom

π∗TM, TP

by assigning to an element ℓp in the
ﬁbre over p the element (Ψa)′
p ◦ℓp in the ﬁbre over Ψa(p) (Exercise 3.8.3). Since
for ℓp ∈J1P we have
π′
Ψa(p) ◦(Ψa)′
p ◦ℓp = π′
p ◦ℓp = idTπ(p)M,

3.8 Universal Connections

the submanifold J1P is invariant under this action. Since J1P is a vertical sub-
bundle of Hom(π∗TM, TP), an argument similar to that for vertical vector sub-
bundles in Example 2.7.2 of Part I shows that J1P is an embedded submanifold
of Hom(π∗TM, TP) (Exercise 3.8.4). Hence, by restriction, the action of G on
Hom(π∗TM, TP) induces the action
Ψ 1 : G × J1P →J1P,
Ψ 1
a (ℓp) = (Ψa)′
p ◦ℓp,
(3.8.4)
of G on J1P. By construction, the action Ψ 1 covers Ψ . By Remark 6.3.9 of Part I,
this implies that it is free and proper. As a consequence, the orbit space
C1P := (J1P)/G
carries a unique smooth manifold structure such that the natural projection
ρ : J1P →C1P
to classes is a submersion. With respect to this structure, J1P is a principal G-bundle
over C1P with action Ψ 1 and projection ρ, cf. Sect.6.5 of Part I.
Another consequence of the fact that Ψ 1 covers Ψ is that the projection π1 :
J1P →P is a morphism of G-bundles. The induced mapping of the base manifolds
δ : C1P →M
is a surjective submersion. To summarize, we have the commutative diagram

Using the mappings (3.8.3) and local sections σ of P over V ⊂M, one can cover
C1P by local diffeomorphisms of the type
ρ ◦χ ◦(σ × idRr ) : V × Rr →δ−1(V ).
Hence, C1P inherits from J1P the structure of a ﬁbre bundle over M with typical ﬁbre
Rr (Exercise 3.8.5). In fact, one can show that it inherits the structure of an afﬁne
bundle with translation vector bundle Hom(TM, Ad(P)).
Lemma 3.8.6 If (U, χ) is a local trivialization of P, then
˜χ : π−1
0 (U) →δ−1(U) × G,
˜χ(ℓ) :=

ρ(ℓ), prG ◦χ ◦π1(ℓ)

is a local trivialization of ρ.

Homotopy Theory of Principal Fibre Bundles. Classiﬁcation
Proof As in Chap.1, we denote κ := prG ◦χ. It sufﬁces to show that the subset
S := {ℓ∈π−1
0 (U) : κ ◦π1(ℓ) = 1}
of π−1
0 (U) is an embedded submanifold transversal to the ﬁbres of ρ, because, then,
ρ induces a diffeomorphism from S onto δ−1(U). Obviously, the inverse of this
diffeomorphism is a local section of ρ over δ−1(U) and ˜χ is the corresponding local
trivialization.
Since κ and π1 are submersions, κ ◦π1 is a submersion, too. Hence, by Corollary
1.8.3 of Part I, S is an embedded submanifold and TℓS = ker(κ ◦π1)′
ℓfor all ℓ∈S.
To check that S is transversal to the ﬁbres of ρ, let A ∈g and let A1
∗denote the
Killing vector ﬁeld on J1P generated by A. We have to show that (κ ◦π1)′
ℓ(A1
∗)ℓ= 0
implies (A1
∗)ℓ= 0. Since π1 and κ are equivariant, we have
(κ ◦π1)′
ℓ(A1

Since left translation by κ ◦π1(ℓ) is a diffeomorphism of G and hence

  is
bijective, it follows that A = 0 and hence (A1
∗)ℓ= 0, as asserted.
■
Now, we will relate connections on P to sections of π1 and δ. As noted above, every
connection ω on P deﬁnes a section ˇω of π1 by assigning to p ∈P the horizontal
lift ℓω
p : Tπ(p)M →Tp P. By the equivariance property of connections, we have
ℓω
Ψa(p) = (Ψa)′
pℓω
p.
Therefore, ˇω is equivariant and hence a morphism of principal G-bundles. As a conse-
quence, it projects to a smooth mapping ˆω : M →C1P and we have the commutative
diagram

Since ˇω is a section of π1, ˆω is a section of δ.
Proposition 3.8.7 Let P be a principal G-bundle over M.
1. The assignment ω →ˇω deﬁnes a bijection between connections on P and G-
equivariant sections of π1 : J1P →P or, equivalently, principal G-bundle mor-
phisms P →J1P satisfying π1 ◦ˇω = idP.
2. Theassignmentω →ˆω deﬁnesabijectionbetweenconnectionson P andsections

P by assigning to p the subspace im



p ◦σ(p) = idTπ(p)M,

3.8 Universal Connections
251
this distribution is complementary to VP and hence deﬁnes a connection σ. We have
ˇσ = σ and ˇω = ω.
2. Given a section σ of δ, we deﬁne a section ˇσ : P →J1P by assigning to p the
unique representative of the class σ

π(p)

in the ﬁbre (J1P)p. Since Ψ 1 projects to
Ψ , this section is equivariant. Let χ be a local trivialization of P. Composing ˇσ with
the induced local trivialization ˜χ of ρ provided by Lemma 3.8.6, we obtain
˜χ ◦ˇσ(p) =

σ ◦π(p), prG ◦χ(p)

.
Hence, ˇσ is smooth. This shows that for every section σ of δ there exists a
unique equivariant section of π1 projecting to σ. In view of point 1, this yields the
assertion.
■
As a consequence of point 2 of Proposition 3.8.7, C1P is usually referred to as
the bundle of connections. However, more appropriately, it could also be called the
manifold of equivariant tangent lifts of P. Accordingly, the jet manifold J1P could
also be called the manifold of tangent lifts of P.
Our next aim is to show that the principal G-bundle ρ : J1P →C1P carries a
tautological connection. The key observation is that we have a tautological mapping
h : T(J1P) →TP,
h(Xℓ) := ℓ(π′
0Xℓ).
(3.8.5)
Associated with h, we have the mapping
v : T(J1P) →TP,
v := π′
1 −h .
(3.8.6)
Lemma 3.8.8 The mappings h and v are equivariant23 vector bundle morphisms
covering π1.
Proof It sufﬁces to prove the assertion for h, because, then, both h and π′
1 project to
π1 and the assertion for v follows.
Obviously, h preserves ﬁbres, projects to π1 and is ﬁbrewise linear. To see that it
is smooth, we decompose it into the smooth mapping
T(J1P) →J1P × π∗TM,
Xℓ→

ℓ, τ(π′


,
restricted in range to the embedded submanifold J1P ×P π∗TM, and the evaluation
mapping
Hom(π∗TM, TP) ×P π∗TM →TP,
(ℓ, X) →ℓ(X).
For a proof that the latter is smooth, see Exercise 3.8.6. Equivariance is obvious. ■
The vector bundle morphisms h and v satisfy the obvious relations
23W.r.t. the actions induced by Ψ 1 and Ψ on the tangent bundles T(J1P) and TP, respectively.

π′ ◦h = π′
0,
π′ ◦v = 0.
(3.8.7)
According to the last relation, v maps T(J1P) to the vertical subbundle VP ⊂TP.
Hence, we can view it as a mapping v : T(J1P) →VP and thus compose it with the
mapping K : VP →g deﬁned on the ﬁbre over p ∈P as the inverse of Ψ ′
p to obtain
a smooth mapping
ω0 := K ◦v : T(J1P) →g.
(3.8.8)
Since v and K are ﬁbrewise linear, so is ω0. Hence, it deﬁnes a 1-form on J1P with
values in g. This 1-form will be denoted by the same symbol.
Proposition 3.8.9 The 1-form ω0 deﬁned by (3.8.8) is a connection form on the
principal G-bundle ρ : J1P →C1P.
Proof According to Proposition 1.3.6, we have to check conditions 2 and 3 of
Proposition 1.3.5. First, let a ∈G. Since v and K are equivariant, one has ω0 ◦
(Ψ 1
a )′ = Ad(a−1) ◦ω0. If we interpret ω0 as a g-valued 1-form, this equation reads
(Ψ 1
a )∗ω0 = Ad(a−1) ◦ω0.
Now, let A ∈g and let A1
∗and A∗denote the Killing vector ﬁelds generated
by A on J1P and P, respectively. Since π0 ◦Ψ 1
a = π0, for every ℓ∈J1P, we have

Deﬁnition 3.8.10 The connection deﬁned by ω0 is called the tautological connection
of the principal G-bundle ρ : J1P →C1P.
The most important property of ω0 is that via pullback it can reproduce every con-
nection on P.
Proposition 3.8.11 For every connection ω on P and the corresponding equivariant
section (or principal G-bundle morphism) ˇω : P →J1P, one has ˇω∗ω0 = ω.
Proof Let ω be given and let p ∈P and X ∈Tp P. Then, ˇω′(X) is a tangent vector
of J1P at ℓω

Remark 3.8.12 The tautological connection ω0 is the unique connection on the prin-
cipal G-bundle ρ : J1P →C1P with the property stated in Proposition 3.8.11, see
Exercise 3.8.7. That is, one may deﬁne it by that property.
♦
With the tautological connection of ρ : J1P →C1P we have a connection at hand
which is universal for the connections on P. To obtain the desired n-universal connec-
tion, we apply the above construction to the following principal G-bundle. By Corol-
lary 3.4.12, there exists a smooth principal G-bundle πE : E →B with πi(E) = 0
for all i ≤n. Deﬁne
˜B := B × R2n,
˜E := E × R2n
and let G act on ˜E by acting on the ﬁrst factor. Obviously, ˜E is a principal G-bundle
over ˜B, where the projection is given by the direct product of πE with the identical
mapping of R2n. It is not hard to see that the mapping
˜E →pr∗
B E,
(e, x) →

πE(e), x

is a principal G-bundle isomorphism over ˜B.
Theorem 3.8.13
1. The principal G-bundle ˜ρ : J1 ˜E →C1 ˜E is n-universal.
2. The tautological connection on ˜ρ : J1 ˜E →C1 ˜E is n-universal.
Proof 1. Since J1 ˜E →˜E is a ﬁbre bundle with contractible ﬁbres, the exact homo-
topy sequence (3.2.6) yields πi(J1 ˜E) = πi( ˜E) for all i. Since R2n is contractible, we
have πi( ˜E) = πi(E) for all i. Since πi(E) = 0 for all i ≤n, Theorem 3.4.6 yields
the assertion.
2. Denote the tautological connection on J1 ˜E by ω0. Let π : P →M be a prin-
cipal G-bundle over M with dim(M) ≤n and let ω be a connection on P. We have
to construct a morphism of principal G-bundles ϑ : P →J1 ˜E such that ϑ∗ω0 = ω.
By Corollary 3.4.12, there exists a smooth mapping f1 : M →B such that
P ∼= f ∗
1 E. By the strong Whitney Embedding Theorem,25 there exists a smooth
embedding f2 : M →R2n. Deﬁne
f : M →˜B,
f (m) :=

f1(m), f2(m)

.
Since f2 is an embedding, so is f . Hence, by the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem
for embedded submanifolds,26 there exists a diffeomorphism χ from an open neigh-
bourhood U of f (M) in ˜B onto an open neighbourhood of the zero section s0 in the
normal bundle NM ⊂f ∗T ˜B such that χ ◦f = s0. Deﬁne

This mapping is a smooth strong deformation retraction of U to the subset f (M).
There exists a unique mapping ϕ : U →M such that f ◦ϕ = H1. In the terminology
of Part I, ϕ is the restriction in range of H1 to the embedded submanifold (M, f ).
By Proposition 1.6.10 of Part I, ϕ is smooth. Consider the pullback bundle ϕ∗P over
U. Using ϕ∗P, we will construct three morphisms ϑ1, ϑ2 and ϑ3 whose composition
will yield the desired morphism ϑ.
First,sinceϕ ◦f = idM,wehaveϕ ◦f ◦π = π.Hence,wecandeﬁneamapping
ϑ1 : P →ϕ∗P,
ϑ1(p) :=

f ◦π(p), p

.
This mapping is easily seen to be a principal G-bundle morphism projecting to f .
Second, let ˜EU denote the restriction of ˜E to U. We claim that there exists an
isomorphism
ϑ2 : ϕ∗P →˜EU.
To see this, let prB : ˜B →B denote the projection to the ﬁrst factor. It is easy to see
that pr∗
B E is isomorphic over ˜B to ˜E. Using this and prB ◦f = f1, we ﬁnd that
P ∼= f ∗
1 E = f ∗pr∗
B E ∼= f ∗˜E
over M. Viewing f as a mapping to U rather than to ˜B, we may replace ˜E by ˜EU
on the right hand side. Taking now the pullback by ϕ, using that f ◦ϕ = H1 is
homotopic to H0 = idU and applying Corollary 3.3.5, we ﬁnd that
ϕ∗P ∼= ϕ∗f ∗˜EU = H ∗
1 ˜EU ∼= ˜EU
over U, as asserted.
Third, via the natural bundle morphism Φ : ϕ∗P →P given by Φ(x, p) = p,
the connection ω on P induces the connection Φ∗ω on the pullback bundle ϕ∗P and
hence the connection (ϑ−1
2 )∗Φ∗ω on ˜EU. Let
ϑ3 : ˜EU →J1 ˜EU ⊂J1 ˜E
be the corresponding principal G-bundle morphism provided by Proposition 3.8.7.
Finally, we compose ϑ1, ϑ2 and ϑ3 to obtain the principal G-bundle morphism
ϑ : P
ϑ1
−→ϕ∗P
ϑ2
−→˜EU
ϑ3
−→J1 ˜E.
To check that it has the desired property, using Proposition 3.8.11 and the obvious
identity Φ ◦ϑ1 = idP, we compute

2 ϑ∗
3 ω0 = ϑ∗

Hint. Show that for a vector bundle π : E →M, the tangent space at a point e ∈E
is spanned by vertical vectors and by tangent vectors of the form σ ′X, where σ is
a (global) section of E with e in its image and X ∈Tπ(e)M. Use a section in the
afﬁne bundle δ : C1P →M to carry over this statement from the translation vector
bundle. Use this and Proposition 3.8.7/2 to prove that for every ℓ∈J1P, the subspace
of Tℓ(J1P) spanned by vectors of the form ˇω′(X), where ω is a connection on P and
X ∈Tπ1(ℓ)P, contains a complement of the tangent space of the G-orbit through ℓ.
Since connections on ρ : J1P →C1P necessarily coincide on the latter subspace,
this proves the assertion.

Chapter 4
Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles.
Characteristic Classes
In Chap.3, we have seen that principal bundles with a given structure group and
a given base manifold are classiﬁed up to vertical isomorphisms by the homotopy
classes of continuous mappings from the base manifold to the classifying space of the
structure group. While this description is complete in that it provides exact labels for
the isomorphism classes, for many problems it is ineffective. Characteristic classes,
on the other hand, allow for applying the machinery of algebraic topology. The price
one has to pay for this is that they are only able to distinguish between the isomor-
phism classes to the extent to which cohomology can resolve homotopy. We will
view characteristic classes as being deﬁned by generators of the cohomology ring
of the classifying space, rather than being deﬁned axiomatically. Accordingly, we
proceed as follows. In Sect.4.2, we study the cohomology rings with coefﬁcients
in Z or Z2 of the classifying spaces for the classical compact Lie groups and use
their generators to deﬁne the Chern, Pontryagin and Stiefel-Whitney classes. The
main tool here is the Euler class of an oriented real vector bundle and the corre-
sponding Gysin sequence. Then, in Sects.4.3 and 4.4, we derive the main properties
of the characteristic classes so constructed, including the Whitney Sum Formula,
the Splitting Principle and the relations induced by ﬁeld extension and ﬁeld restric-
tion. In Sect.4.6, we discuss the Weil homomorphism, which provides a geometric
description of characteristic classes in terms of de Rham cohomology. In Sect.4.7,
we deal with genera and the Chern character as examples of formal power series
in the characteristic classes. Finally, in Sect.4.8, we explain a method to construct
an approximation of the classifying space in terms of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces,
known as the Postnikov tower. It allows for proving, for example, that the Chern
classes classify U(n)-bundles over manifolds of small dimension. This method will
also be used in the discussion of gauge orbit types in Chap.8.

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
4.1
Basics
We assume the reader to be familiar with the basics of homology and cohomology
theory. To ﬁx the notation, let a topological space X be given. We denote
• the group of singular k-chains in X by Ck(X),
• the k-th singular homology group of X by Hk(X),
• the k-th singular cohomology group with coefﬁcients in the commutative ring R
by Hk
R(X),
• H∗
R(X) = ∞
k=0 Hk
R(X).
Recall that Hk
R(X) is a module over R and that H∗
R(X) is a ring with respect to the cup
product. The cup product of α, β ∈H∗
R(X) will be denoted by α ∪β or simply by αβ.
We use the convention Hk
R(X) = 0 for k < 0. Given a subset A ⊂X, let Ck(X, A),
Hk(X, A), Hk
R(X, A) and H∗
R(X, A) denote the corresponding relative objects. We will
use a number of basic tools from algebraic topology, notably
• the Hurewicz Theorem, cf. Sect.VII.10 in [104],
• the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorems, cf. Sect.5.5 in [598],
• the Künneth Theorem for cohomology, cf. [598, Theorem 5.5.11].
In the ﬁrst part of this section, we introduce the notion of characteristic class and
discuss its basic properties. While characteristic classes can be deﬁned for general
ﬁbre bundles, we restrict our attention to the case of principal bundles and vector
bundles.
Deﬁnition 4.1.1 Let G be a Lie group and let R be a commutative ring. An R-valued
characteristic class for principal G-bundles assigns to every topological principal G-
bundle P →B a cohomology class α(P) ∈H∗
R(B) such that the following holds. For
every continuous mapping f : B′ →B one has
α(f ∗P) = f ∗α(P) .
Characteristic classes for vector bundles are deﬁned by analogy.
First, let us discuss characteristic classes for principal G-bundles. These are
closely related to the cohomology of the classifying space BG. Let ξ ∈H∗
R(BG).
For a topological principal G-bundle P over B, deﬁne
α(P) := f ∗
P ξ
(4.1.1)
with some classifying mapping fP : B →BG for P. This makes sense, because fP
is determined up to homotopy, and homotopic mappings induce the same homo-
morphism in cohomology. For the same reason, by the universality of the principal
G-bundle EG →BG, one has α(P1) = α(P2) whenever P1 and P2 are vertically
isomorphic.

4.1 Basics
259
Proposition 4.1.2 For every cohomology class ξ ∈H∗
R(BG), the assignment (4.1.1)
deﬁnes an R-valued characteristic class for principal G-bundles. Every R-valued
characteristic class for principal G-bundles arises in this way.
Proof To see that α deﬁned by (4.1.1) is a characteristic class, let f : B′ →B be
given. If fP : B →BG is a classifying mapping for P, then fP ◦f : B′ →BG is a
classifying mapping for f ∗P. Hence,
α(f ∗P) = (fP ◦f )∗ξ = f ∗◦f ∗

ξ := ˜α(EG) ∈H∗
R(BG)
and let α denote the characteristic class deﬁned by ξ via (4.1.1). Since ˜α is a char-
acteristic class, for any principal G-bundle P with classifying mapping fP, we have
˜α(P) = f ∗
P ˜α(EG) = f ∗
P ξ = α(P) .
■
Since the cohomology elements of the classifying space BG correspond bijectively
to the characteristic classes for principal G-bundles, they are often referred to as the
universal characteristic classes for G.
Proposition 4.1.3 Let λ : G1 →G2 be a Lie group homomorphism and let ξ ∈
H∗
R(BG2). Let α be the characteristic class for G2-bundles deﬁned by ξ and let ˜α be
the characteristic class for G1-bundles deﬁned by (Bλ)∗ξ ∈H∗
R(BG1). Then, given
topological principal Gi-bundles Pi over Bi and a morphism ϑ : P1 →P2 whose
group homomorphism coincides with λ, we have
˜α(P1) = f ∗α(P2) ,
where f : B1 →B2 denotes the projection of ϑ.
Proof Let fi : Bi →BGi be classifying mappings for Pi, i = 1, 2. According to
Proposition 3.7.6, then f2 ◦f is homotopic to Bλ ◦f1. Hence,
f ∗α(P2) = f ∗(f ∗

In the special case where P2 = P1[λ] and ϑ : P1 →P2 is the natural morphism send-
ing p to [(p, 1G2)], Proposition 4.1.3 yields the following.
Corollary 4.1.4 Let λ : G1 →G2 be a Lie group homomorphism and let ξ ∈

Now, let us turn to characteristic classes for vector bundles. Let K = R, C, H and
let UK(n) denote O(n) for K = R, U(n) for K = C and Sp(n) for K = H. Let ξ ∈
H∗
R(BUK(n)). For a K-vector bundle E of rank n over a topological space B, deﬁne
α(E) := f ∗
E ξ
(4.1.2)
with some classifying mapping fE : B →BUK(n) = GK(n, ∞) for E, cf. Remark
3.6.10/1. By the same argument as in the case of principal bundles, this makes sense
and one has α(E1) = α(E2) whenever E1 and E2 are vertically isomorphic.
Proposition 4.1.5 For every ξ ∈H∗
R(BUK(n)), the assignment (4.1.2) deﬁnes an
R-valued characteristic class for K-vector bundles of rank n. Every R-valued char-
acteristic class for K-vector bundles of rank n arises in this way.
Proof The argument proving that α deﬁned by (4.1.2) is a characteristic class is
analogous to that for principal bundles. To see that every characteristic class arises
in this way, let ˜α be a characteristic class for K-vector bundles of rank n. Deﬁne
ξ := ˜α

EUK(n) ×UK(n) Kn

and let α denote the characteristic class deﬁned by ξ via (4.1.2). Since ˜α is a charac-

have
˜α(E) = f ∗
E ˜α

EUK(n) ×UK(n) Kn

E ξ = α(E) ,
because E is vertically isomorphic to f ∗

■
Remark 4.1.6
1. Let ξ ∈H∗
R(BUK(n)) and let α stand for both the corresponding characteristic
class for principal UK(n)-bundles and the corresponding characteristic class for
K-vector bundles of rank n. According to Remark 3.6.10/1, for every principal
UK(n)-bundle P, one has α(P) = α(P ×U(n) Kn) and for every K-vector bundle
E of rank n one has α(E) = α(O(E)), where the orthonormal frame bundle is
taken with respect to some chosen positive deﬁnite ﬁbre metric.
2. Since a trivial principal G-bundle P over M has constant classifying mapping,
for any characteristic class of degree k > 0, one has α(P) = 0. An analogous
statement holds for trivial vector bundles.
♦
In the second part of this section, we discuss the main tools needed for the study
of the characteristic classes for the classical compact Lie groups. Our discussion is
based, in effect, on the Leray-Hirsch Theorem, which we cite here for completeness.

4.1 Basics
261
Given a topological ﬁbre bundle E over B with projection π and a commutative ring
R, we can deﬁne a mapping
H∗
R(B) × H∗
R(E) →H∗
R(E) ,
(α, γ ) 
→(π∗α) ∪γ .
This yields an action of the ring H∗
R(B) on the Abelian group H∗
R(E) and thus makes
H∗
R(E) into a module over H∗
R(B). For b ∈B, let jb : Eb →E denote the natural
inclusion mapping of the ﬁbres. Recall that a ﬁnitely generated module M over a
ring R is said to be free if it is isomorphic to the Cartesian product Rr for some r,
and that a basis of M is said to be free if it corresponds to such an isomorphism.
Theorem 4.1.7 (Leray-Hirsch) Let E be a topological ﬁbre bundle over B with
projection π and typical ﬁbre Fand let R be a commutative ring. Assume that H∗
R(F)
is a ﬁnitely generated free R-module and that there exist elements τ1, . . . , τr ∈Hki
R (E)
such that j∗
bτ1, . . . , j∗
bτr form a free basis of H∗
R(Eb) as an R-module for every b ∈B.
Then, τ1, . . . , τr form a free basis of H∗
R(E) as a H∗
R(B)-module.
■
For the proof we refer to [287]. Explicitly, this theorem states that the mapping
(H∗
R(B))r →H∗
R(E) ,
(α1, . . . , αr) 
→
r

i=1
(π∗αi) ∪τi ,
(4.1.3)
is an isomorphism of H∗
R(B)-modules, and thus in particular of Abelian groups. As a
consequence of the Leray-Hirsch Theorem, H∗
R(E) is isomorphic, as an R-module, to
H∗
R(B) ⊗R H∗
R(F). Thus, the cohomology of a topological ﬁbre bundle whose typical
ﬁbre meets the assumption of the theorem is completely determined by that of the
base and the typical ﬁbre and does not depend on the topological type of that bundle.
As we have seen above, to determine the characteristic classes for the classical
compact Lie groups, we have to determine the cohomology of the corresponding
classifying spaces. This will be done by induction on the rank. Without loss of
generality, for given n, we choose the inclusion jn−1,n : UK(n −1) →UK(n) to be
induced by the inclusion mapping
Kn−1 →Kn ,
(x1, . . . , xn−1) 
→(x1, . . . , xn−1, 0) .
According to Proposition 3.7.5/1, the classifying space BUK(n −1) can be realized
as a topological ﬁbre bundle over BUK(n) with projection Bjn−1,n and typical ﬁbre
UK(n)/UK(n −1). Since
UK(n)/UK(n −1) ∼= Sdn−1,
where d is the dimension of K over R, the typical ﬁbres are spheres. For sphere
bundles, the Gysin sequence, to be discussed below, connects the cohomology groups
of the base space with those of the total space, and it does so using the Euler class.

262

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
Both the Euler class and the Gysin sequence are provided by the Thom Isomorphism
Theorem, which we will give now without proof.
Let B be a topological space and let E be a Riemannian vector bundle of rank n
over B with projection π. For e ∈E, let ∥e∥denote the corresponding ﬁbre norm.
Deﬁne subsets
DE := {e ∈E : ∥e∥≤1} ,
SE := {e ∈E : ∥e∥= 1} .
In the respective relative topology, DE is a vertical subbundle of E with typical ﬁbre
Dn and SE is a vertical subbundle of DE with typical ﬁbre Sn−1. Let
πD : DE →B ,
πS : SE →B
denote the corresponding projections, induced from π by restriction. Thus, DE is a
disk bundle and SE is its boundary sphere bundle. Recall that an orientation of E is
given by a covering by local trivializations whose transition mappings have positive
determinant. Via these local trivializations, an orientation of E deﬁnes an orientation
of every ﬁbre Eb of E. The latter deﬁnes a generator of Hn
Z(DEb, SEb) as follows.
By the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem, Hn
Z(DEb, SEb) = Hom

Hn(DEb, SEb), Z

.
The desired generator corresponds to the homomorphism which assigns the value 1
to the generator of Hn(DEb, SEb) represented by the orientation preserving homeo-
morphisms of the n-simplex to DEb ⊂Eb.
In what follows, let p : Ck(DE) →Ck(DE, SE) denote the natural projection to
classes. Recall that the cup product induces a bi-additive mapping
∪: H∗
R(DE) × H∗
R(DE, SE) →H∗
R(DE, SE)
by the condition that
p∗(α ∪β) = α ∪p∗β
(4.1.4)
for all α ∈H∗
R(DE) and β ∈H∗
R(DE, SE). Note that jb induces a pair mapping
(DEb, SEb) →(DE, SE) denoted by the same symbol.
Theorem 4.1.8 (Thom Isomorphism Theorem) Let E be a Riemannian vector bun-
dle of rank n over a connected topological space B with projection π. Let R = Z2,
or let R = Z and assume that E is oriented.
1. There exists a unique element τ ∈Hn
R(DE, SE) such that for every b ∈B, j∗
bτ
is the generator of Hn
R(DEb, SEb) (deﬁned by the induced orientation in case
R = Z).
2. The homomorphism Hk
R(B) →Hk+n
R
(DE, SE) deﬁned by α 
→(π∗
Dα) ∪τ is an
isomorphism for all k ≥0 and Hk
R(DE, SE) = 0 for all k < n.
Proof The proof uses a relative version of the Leray-Hirsch Theorem, see Theorem
4D.10 and Corollary 4D.9 in [287].
■

4.1 Basics
263
Point 2 states that the single element τ forms a free basis of the module H∗
R(DE, SE)
over H∗
R(B). For further use, we note that the theorem implies, in particular, that
j∗
b : Hk
R(DE, SE) →Hk
R(DEb, SEb) is an isomorphism in dimension k ≤n for all
b ∈B.
Deﬁnition 4.1.9 (Thom class and Euler class) Let E be a Riemannian vector bundle
of rank n over a connected topological space B. Let R = Z2, or let R = Z and assume
that E is oriented.
1. The class τ ∈Hn
R(DE, SE) provided by Theorem 4.1.8 is called the Thom class
of E.
2. Let sD : B →DE denote the zero section. The class e(E) := s∗
D ◦p∗(τ) in Hn
R(B)
is called the Euler class of E.
Thus, every Riemannian vector bundle has an Euler class in Z2-cohomology. If it is
oriented, it has in addition an Euler class in Z-cohomology.
For a topological space X and a commutative ring R, let
δ : Hom

Ck(X), R



Ck+1(X), R

denote the coboundary operator and let Zk
R(X) ⊂Hom

Ck(X), R

denote its kernel
(that is, the subgroup of closed singular cochains in X with coefﬁcients in R).
Theorem 4.1.10 (Gysin sequence) Let E be a Riemannian vector bundle of rank n
over a connected topological space B. Let R = Z2, or let R = Z and assume that E
is oriented. Then one has a long exact sequence of Abelian groups

Ck+n(SE) to Ck+n(DE).

According to the Thom Isomorphism Theorem, we can replace Hk

To read off ϕ from the last equation, we apply s∗

(4.1.6), we obtain
ϕ([γ ]) ∪e(E) = s∗
D[δ ˜γ ] .
This yields the asserted formula for ϕ.
■
Remark 4.1.11 The Euler class and the Gysin sequence exist for any sphere bundle
(ﬁbre bundle with typical ﬁbre a sphere). In the general case, the role of DE is
played by the mapping cone of the projection of that sphere bundle. While the Thom
class depends on the ﬁbre metric of E, the Euler class does not. The latter follows by
observing that the disk bundles DE deﬁned by different ﬁbre metrics are deformation
retracts of each other.
♦
Proposition 4.1.12 (Properties of the Euler class)
1. If the rank of a connected oriented real vector bundle E is odd, then 2e(E) = 0.
2. The Z2-Euler class of a connected oriented real vector bundle coincides with the
Z2-reduction of the integral Euler class of that bundle.
3. Let E1, E2 be connected real vector bundles over B1, B2, respectively. Let F :
E1 →E2 be a vector bundle morphism and let f : B1 →B2 be its projection.
Let R = Z2 or let R = Z and assume that E1 and E2 are oriented and that F
preserves the orientations. If the ﬁbre mappings of F are isomorphisms, then
f ∗e(E2) = e(E1).
4. Let E1 and E2 be connected real vector bundles over B. Let R = Z2 or let R = Z
and assume that E1 and E2 are oriented and that E1 ⊕E2 carries the orientation
induced by concatenation of frames. Then, e(E1 ⊕E2) = e(E1) ∪e(E2).
Proof 1. This holds trivially true in the case R = Z2. Thus, assume that E is oriented
and that R = Z. Choose an auxiliary Riemannian ﬁbre metric on E and let τ denote
the corresponding Thom class. Multiplication by −1 deﬁnes an isometric vertical

4.1 Basics
265
vector bundle automorphism of E and, thus, a vertical bundle automorphism F of
DE. Since F is vertical, for all b ∈B, we have j∗
b ◦F∗(τ) = F∗
b ◦j∗
b(τ). Since n is
odd, Fb reverses the orientation of the ﬁbre (DE)b. Hence, F∗
b ◦j∗
b(τ) = −j∗
b(τ). By
uniqueness of τ, this implies F∗τ = −τ. Using F ◦sD = sD and p∗◦F∗= F∗◦p∗,
we ﬁnally obtain e = −e. This yields the assertion.
2. It sufﬁces to show that the Z2-Thom class of an oriented connected vector
bundle coincides with the Z2-reduction of the integral Thom class. In view of the
Thom Isomorphism Theorem, this follows from the fact that the Z2-reduction of a
generator of Hn
Z((DE)b, (SE)b) is a generator of Hn
Z2((DE)b, (SE)b).
3. Since F is ﬁbrewise a vector space isomorphism, E1 and E2 must have the
same rank n. We can choose Riemannian ﬁbre metrics on E1 and E2 such that F
is isometric (Exercise 4.1.1). Then, F induces a bundle morphism F : DE1 →DE2,
denoted by the same symbol, which sends SE1 to SE2 and whose ﬁbre mappings are
homeomorphisms. Let τi ∈Hn
R(DEi, SEi) denote the Thom class of Ei, i = 1, 2. For
every b ∈B1,
j∗
b ◦F∗(τ2) = F∗
b ◦j∗
f (b)(τ2) .
As a consequence of the Thom Isomorphism Theorem, j∗
f (b)(τ2) is a generator of
Hn
R((DE2)f (b), (SE2)f (b)). Since Fb is a homeomorphism, F∗
b maps this generator to
a generator of Hn
R((DE1)b, (SE1)b). Since Fb preserves the orientations, the latter
coincides with j∗
bτ1. Since j∗
b is an isomorphism in dimension n, we conclude that
F∗(τ2) = τ1 . The assertion now follows by observing that the zero sections si : Bi →
DEi fulﬁl F ◦s1 = s2 ◦f .
4. We give the proof for R = Z. The proof for R = Z2 can be obtained by forgetting
about the orientation.
Denote E⊕:= E1 ⊕E2. We choose auxiliary Riemannian ﬁbre metrics on E1 and
E2 and equip E⊕with their direct sum. For i = 1, 2, ⊕, let ni denote the rank of
Ei, write Di := DEi and Si := SEi, and let τi ∈Hni
Z (Di, Si) denote the Thom class
of Ei. Moreover, deﬁne D× := D1 ×B D2 and S× := (S1 ×B D2) ∪(D1 ×B S2). For
i = 1, 2, ⊕, ×,letji,b : Di,b →Di denotethenaturalinclusionmappingsoftheﬁbres.
Deﬁne a mapping
F : E⊕→E⊕,
F(e1, e2) :=
 max{∥e1∥,∥e2∥}
∥(e1,e2)∥
(e1, e2) (e1, e2) ̸= 0 ,
0
(e1, e2) = 0 .
Since
max{∥e1∥, ∥e2∥} ≤∥(e1, e2)∥≤
√
2 max{∥e1∥, ∥e2∥} ,
F is a homeomorphism and thus a ﬁbre bundle isomorphism. Since
∥F(e1, e2)∥= max{∥e1∥, ∥e2∥} ,
it maps D× onto D⊕and S× onto S⊕and hence induces a pair homeomorphism
(D×, S×) →(D⊕, S⊕), denoted by the same symbol. For every b ∈B, we have

Since the ﬁbre mappings Fb are pair homeomorphisms and since they preserve

corresponding to the product orientation. On the other hand, consider the relative
cohomology cross product1
τ1 × τ2 ∈Hn1+n2
Z
(D1 × D2, S1 × D2 ∪D1 × S2)
and the natural inclusion mapping ι : D× →D1 × D2. One can check that one has
j1,b × j2,b = ι ◦j×,b and that j1,b × j2,b and ι induce pair mappings from (D×,b, S×,b)

orientation. Thus,

⊕,b is an
isomorphism in degree n⊕, so is j∗
×,b. Therefore, (4.1.8) implies
ι∗(τ1 × τ2) = F∗τ⊕.
(4.1.9)
Now, for i = 1, 2, ⊕, ×, let pi : Cni(Di) →Cni(Di, Si) denote the natural projections

Characteristic Classes for the Classical Groups
In this section, we determine the integral cohomology rings for BU(n), BSU(n) and
BSp(n) and the Z2-cohomology rings of BO(n) and BSO(n). All of these rings will
turn out to be polynomial. The integral cohomology of BO(n) and BSO(n) is more
involved and will be given without proof in Theorem 4.2.23.
To begin with, let us introduce some terminology and notation. Given a ﬁnite
set X = {x1, . . . , xN} and an Abelian group A, the ring of formal polynomials in the
commuting variables xi with coefﬁcients from A will be referred to as the polynomial
ring generated over A by X.
For a K-vector space V and a subﬁeld L ⊂K, let VL denote the L-vector space
obtained from V by ﬁeld restriction, that is, by restricting multiplication by scalars to
the subﬁeld L. The same notation will be used for vector bundles. For details about
ﬁeld restriction and ﬁeld extension we refer to Appendix A. For our construction of
characteristic classes for U(n) and Sp(n), we will use the concrete real vector space
isomorphisms R2n →Cn
R given by
(x1, . . . , x2n) 
→(x1 + x2i, . . . , x2n−1 + x2ni) ,
(4.2.1)

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
Given a complex vector bundle E, the real vector bundle ER obtained from E by
ﬁeld restriction is called the realiﬁcation of E. We endow ER with an orientation2 as
follows. If (e1, . . . , en) is an ordered local frame in E, then
(e1, ie1, . . . , en, ien)
(4.2.5)
is an ordered local frame in ER. Clearly, the transition mapping between two local
frames of the form (4.2.5) is given by the composition of the transition mapping
between the original frames in E with the Lie subgroup embedding GL(n, C) →
GL(2n, R) deﬁned by the isomorphism (4.2.1). Since the latter takes values in
the identity connected component, the transition mapping has positive determinant.
Thus, the ordered local frames in ER of the form (4.2.5) deﬁne an orientation in ER.
We will refer to this orientation as the orientation induced by E.3 In terms of local
trivializations, the induced orientation is given by the family of local trivializations
of ER which are obtained from local trivializations of E by composition with the
isomorphisms (4.2.1).
An analogous argument applies in the case where E is a quaternionic vector
bundle. Here, the induced orientation of the realiﬁcation ER is deﬁned by the ordered
local frames of the form
(e1, e1i, e1j, e1k, . . . , en, eni, enj, enk) ,
(4.2.6)
for some ordered local frame (e1, . . . , en) in E.
Both for complex and quaternionic vector bundles, the induced orientation on the
realiﬁcation has the property that every real vector bundle morphism (E1)R →(E2)R
which is obtained by ﬁeld restriction from a complex or quaternionic vector bundle
morphism E1 →E2 automatically preserves the orientations. Moreover, in case E1
and E2 have the same base, the induced orientation in (E1 ⊕E2)R coincides with the
orientation in (E1)R ⊕(E2)R deﬁned by the induced orientations in (E1)R and (E2)R
and by concatenation of ordered local frames.
Now, we are prepared to discuss the characteristic classes of the classical groups.
We start with the integral characteristic classes for the unitary groups U(n). Deﬁne
E
U
n :=

EU(n) ×U(n) Cn
R ,
where U(n) acts on Cn in the basic representation, and endow EU
n with the induced
orientation. From the characterization of this orientation in terms of local trivial-
izations it is clear that, ﬁbrewise and via the isomorphism (4.2.1), this orientation
corresponds to the standard orientation of R2n. Let cU(n)
n
∈H2n
Z (BU(n)) denote the
corresponding Euler class, that is,

The ring H∗
Z(BU(n)) is the polynomial ring over Z in the generators c

Proof As explained earlier, the strategy of the proof is to relate the cohomology of
BU(n −1) with that of BU(n) by means of the Gysin sequence. Taking the real part
of the standard scalar product on the complex vector space Cn, we obtain a scalar
product on the real vector space Cn
R and thus a Riemannian ﬁbre metric on the real
vector bundle EU
n. Then,
DE

SE
U
n = EU(n) ×U(n) S2n−1 ,
where D2n and S2n−1 stand for the unit disk and the unit sphere in Cn
R. The sphere
bundle SEU
n is related to the sphere bundle BjU
n−1,n : BU(n −1) →BU(n) as fol-
lows. By Proposition 3.7.5/1, in the latter, the total space BU(n −1) is realized as
EU(n)/U(n −1).4 By point 1 of Example 1.2.4, there exists a vertical ﬁbre bundle
isomorphism
F : BU(n −1) →SE

for all n = 1, 2, . . . Using this isomorphism, in the Gysin sequence of EU
n, we
can replace Hk

Z(BU(n −1)), the homomorphism π∗
S by F∗◦π∗
S =
(BjU
n−1,n)∗and the connecting homomorphism ϕ by ϕ ◦(F∗)−1, which we continue
to denote by ϕ. This way, for l ∈Z and n = 1, 2, . . . , we obtain the exact sequence

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
For n = 1, we have to show that H∗
Z(BU(1)) is the free polynomial ring in the
generator c
U(1)
1 . Since U(0) is the trivial group, the total space BU(0) coincides with
EU(1) and BjU
0,1 coincides with the bundle projection EU(1) →BU(1). Since EU(1)
is contractible, Hk
Z(EU(1)) = 0 for k ̸= 0. Hence, (4.2.9) yields that multiplication
by c
U(1)
1
deﬁnes an isomorphism from Hl
Z(BU(1)) onto Hl+2
Z (BU(1)) for all l ̸= −2.
It follows that Hl
Z(BU(1)) = 0 for odd l. Moreover, since BU(1) is connected and
hence H0
Z(BU(1)) is the free Abelian group generated by 1BU(1), it follows that for
every non-negative integer k, H2k
Z (BU(1)) is the free Abelian group generated by

c
U(1)
1
k. Thus, H∗
Z(BU(1)) is the free polynomial ring in the generator c
U(1)
1 , indeed.
Now, assume that the assertion holds for n −1. We aim at showing that it holds
true for n. First, we construct the classes c
U(n)
k
for k = 1, . . . , n −1. If, for such k, we
plug l = 2(k −n) into (4.2.9), we ﬁnd that (BjU
n−1,n)∗is an isomorphism in degree
2k. Hence, there exists a unique element c
U(n)
k
of H2k
Z (BU(n)) such that

Bj

U(n)

It remains to prove that H∗
Z(BU(n)) is the polynomial ring in the generators
c
U(n)
1 , . . . , cU(n)
n . For that purpose, we ﬁrst show that ϕ = 0 in (4.2.9). By the induction
assumption, Hl
Z(BU(n −1)) is the free Abelian group generated by all monomi-
als of degree l in c
U(n−1)
1
, . . . , c
U(n−1)
n−1 . Since

BjU
n−1,n
∗preserves products, each of
these monomials is the image under

BjU
n−1,n
∗of the corresponding monomial in
c
U(n)
1 , . . . , c
U(n)
n−1. Therefore,

BjU
n−1,n
∗is surjective. By exactness of (4.2.9), it follows
that ϕ = 0, indeed. As a result, (4.2.9) splits into the short exact sequences
0 →Hl

∪cU(n)

−−−→Hl+2n
Z
(BU(n))
(BjU
n−1,n)∗
−−−−−→Hl+2n
Z
(BU(n −1)) →0 .
(4.2.10)
We use this sequence to show that, for all k, Hk
Z(BU(n)) is the free Abelian group
generated by the monomials of degree k in c
U(n)
1 , . . . , cU(n)
n .
For l < 0, (4.2.10) implies that

BjU
n−1,n
∗is an isomorphism in degree k < 2n.
Hence, here the assertion follows from the induction assumption and the fact that a
monomial of degree k < 2n cannot contain cU(n)
n .
For l ≥0, since we know Hl+2n
Z
(BU(n −1)), the sequence (4.2.10) allows for
reconstructing Hl+2n
Z
(BU(n)) from Hl
Z(BU(n)). As a consequence, it sufﬁces to show
that if the assertion holds in degree l, then it holds in degree l + 2n. Thus, assume that
the assertion holds for l. Then, by exactness, Hl
Z(BU(n)) ∪cU(n)
n
is the free Abelian
group generated by the monomials of degree l + 2n in c
U(n)
1 , . . . , cU(n)
n
with at least one
factor cU(n)
n . On the other hand, consider the subgroup A of Hl+2n
Z
(BU(n)) generated
by the monomials of degree l + 2n in c
U(n)
1 , . . . , c
U(n)
n−1. These monomials are mapped
via

BjU
n−1,n
∗to the corresponding monomials in c
U(n−1)
1
, . . . , c
U(n−1)
n−1 . By the induction
assumption, the latter are free generators of Hl+2n
Z
(BU(n −1)). Hence, the former are

free generators of A and

BjU
n−1,n
∗maps A isomorphically onto Hl+2n
Z
(BU(n −1)).
This ﬁnally implies that Hl+2n
Z
(BU(n)) is the direct sum of Hl
Z(BU(n)) ∪cU(n)
n
and A.
Thus, the assertion is true for l + 2n. It follows that the assertion holds for all k ≥2n.

In view of Theorem 4.2.1, equation (4.2.11) implies that (BjU

that its kernel coincides with the ideal in H∗
Z(BU(n)) generated by c
U(n)

In particular, (BjU

is the only element of H2k
Z (BU(n)) satisfying (4.2.11).
2. Owing to the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem for cohomology in the form of
Theorem 5.5.10 of [598],5 Theorem 4.2.1 implies that H∗
R(BU(n)) is the poly-
nomial ring over R in the Chern classes. and that H∗
Z2(BU(n)) is the polynomial
ring over Z2 in the mod 2 reductions of the Chern classes.

Remark 4.2.4
1. The top Chern class cn(E) of a complex vector bundle E of rank n coincides
with the Euler class of the real vector bundle ER obtained by ﬁeld restriction and
endowed with the induced orientation,
cn(E) = e(ER) .
(4.2.12)
To see this, let B be the base space of E and let f : B →BU(n) be a classifying
mapping for E. By deﬁnition of cU(n)
n ,
cn(E) = f ∗c
U(n)
n
= f ∗e(E
U
n) .
Let F : E →EU(n) ×U(n) Cn be the complex vector bundle morphism obtained
by composing a vertical isomorphism E →f ∗(EU(n) ×U(n) Cn) with the natural
morphism associated with the pullback. The morphism F projects to f . By ﬁeld
restriction, it induces a real vector bundle morphism ER →EU
n. Since the latter
preserves the induced orientations, Proposition 4.1.12/3 yields e(ER) = f ∗e(EU
n).
This proves (4.2.12).
2. In view of Remark 4.1.6, it follows from point 1 that the top Chern class cn(P) of
a principal U(n)-bundle P coincides with the Euler class of the real vector bundle
obtained by ﬁeld restriction from the complex vector bundle P ×U(n) Cn associ-
ated with P via the basic representation, endowed with the induced orientation:

(4.2.13)
3. Let P be a principal U(n)-bundle over a manifold M. Via the natural surjective
homomorphism H2k
Z (M) →Hom(H2k(M), Z), the Chern classes ck(P) deﬁne
homomorphisms H2k(M) →Z. Given a set of generators {s1, . . . , sr} of H2k(M),
the integers obtained by evaluating ck(P) on the si are called the Chern indices
of P and are denoted by ck,1(P), . . . , ck,r(P). Accordingly, one deﬁnes the Chern
indices ck,i(E) of a complex vector bundle E.

Next, we discuss the special unitary groups SU(n). Let jSU,U

the natural inclusion mapping. Since SU(n) is a normal subgroup of U(n),
Bj
SU,U
n
: BSU(n) →BU(n)
is a principal bundle with structure group U(n)/SU(n) ∼= U(1), cf. Proposition

n
denote the real vector bundle obtained by ﬁeld restriction from the
associated vector bundle EU(n) ×U(n) C, where U(n) acts on C via the determinant,
and endow Edet
n
with the induced orientation.
We claim that the Euler class of Edet
n
is given by c
U(n)
1 . For n = 1, this holds
trivially, because Edet
1
= EU
1 as oriented vector bundles. For n > 1, we realize BU(1)
as EU(n)/U(1), where U(1) acts on EU(n) via jU
1,n. Then, Edet
1
= EU(n) ×U(1) CR,
and the natural projection to classes EU(n) × CR →Edet
n
descends to an orientation-
preserving vector bundle morphism Edet

which projects to BjU

Corollary 4.2.8 (Obstructions to orientability in the complex case)
1. Let P be a principal SU(n)-bundle and let Q be the extension of P to the structure
group U(n). Then,
c(Q) = c(P) .
In particular, if a principal U(n)-bundle Q admits a reduction to the structure
group SU(n), then c1(Q) = 0.
2. If a complex vector bundle E is orientable, then c1(E) = 0.
In Sect.4.8 we will prove that the vanishing of the ﬁrst Chern class is also sufﬁcient
for a principal U(n)-bundle to admit a reduction to the structure group SU(n) and
for a complex vector bundle to be orientable, cf. Corollary 4.8.2.
Proof
1. Let f be a classifying mapping for P. According to Proposition 3.7.2/1, then
BjSU,U

◦f is a classifying mapping for the extension Q. Hence, (4.2.15) yields
c(Q) = f ∗◦

SU(n) = c(P) .
If now Q is a principal U(n)-bundle and P is a reduction of Q to the structure group
SU(n), then Q is vertically isomorphic to the extension of P to the structure group
U(n). Since vertically isomorphic principal bundles have the same characteristic
classes, c(Q) coincides with the total Chern class of the extension. As was just
shown, then c(Q) = c(P) and, therefore, c1(Q) = 0.
2. This follows from point 1 by observing that if E is orientable, then the orthonor-
mal frame bundle of E with respect to some auxiliary ﬁbre metric admits a reduction
to the structure group SU(n) (Exercise 4.2.1).

Next, we pass to the discussion of the compact symplectic groups Sp(n). The argu-

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
Remark 4.2.3 carries over in an obvious way to the present case (Exercise 4.2.3).
The classes p
Sp(n)
k
and pSp(n) deﬁne characteristic classes for principal Sp(n)-bundles
and quaternionic vector bundles. The latter are denoted, respectively, by pk(P), p(P),
pk(E) and p(E). By construction,
p(P) = 1 + p1(P) + · · · + pn(P) ,
p(E) = 1 + p1(E) + · · · + pn(E) .
By means of the natural homomorphism H4k
Z (M) →Hom(H4k(M), Z), for every
principal Sp(n)-bundle P and every quaternionic vector bundle one can deﬁne the
Pontryagin indices pk,i(P) and pk,i(E), respectively, relative to a chosen set of gen-
erators of H4k(M).
Finally, we discuss the orthogonal groups O(n) and the special orthogonal groups
SO(n). The standard action of O(n) on Rn, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , deﬁnes the associated
real vector bundle
E
O
n = EO(n) ×O(n) Rn .
Since EO
n is universal for real vector bundles of rank n, it cannot be orientable, because
otherwise every real vector bundle of rank n would be orientable. It is known that
this is not true. An argument will be given below. Thus, EO
n has an Euler class in
Z2-cohomology only, and the Gysin sequence of EO
n can provide information about
the Z2-cohomology of BO(n) only. Nevertheless, Gysin sequences allow for deriving
the integral cohomology of H∗
Z(BSO(n)) and H∗
Z(BO(n)). The arguments involved
are sophisticated though.

with the Z2-Euler class of that vector bundle.
3. The top Stiefel-Whitney class wn(P) of a principal O(n)-bundle P coincides with
the Z2-Euler class of the real vector bundle P ×O(n) Rn associated with P by
means of the basic representation of O(n).

Now, we turn to the discussion of the special orthogonal groups SO(n). We derive
the Z2-cohomology of BSO(n) from that of BO(n) in complete analogy with the dis-

The proof of the following corollary of Theorem 4.2.14 is completely analogous to
that of Corollary 4.2.17 and is left to the reader.

4.2 Characteristic Classes for the Classical Groups
279
Corollary 4.2.17 (Obstructions to orientability in the real case)
1. Let P be a principal SO(n)-bundle and let Q be the extension of P to the structure
group O(n). Then,
w(Q) = w(P) .
In particular, if a principal O(n)-bundle Q admits a reduction to the structure
group SO(n), then w1(Q) = 0.
2. If a real vector bundle E is orientable, then w1(E) = 0.
■
In Sect.4.8, we will prove that the vanishing of the ﬁrst Stiefel-Whitney class is
also sufﬁcient for a principal O(n)-bundle to admit a reduction to the structure group
SO(n) and for a real vector bundle to be orientable, cf. Corollary 4.8.4.
Example 4.2.18 We determine the Chern class of the canonical U(1)-bundle Pn =
SC(1, n + 1) over GC(1, n + 1) = CPn, cf. Remark 1.1.21/3 and Example 1.1.24.
Let Ln denote the tautological line bundle over CPn, obtained by attaching to each
point of CPn the subspace of Cn+1 represented by this point. One can check that the
mapping
Pn ×U(1) C →Ln ,
[(z, ζ)] 
→ζz ,
is a vertical isomorphism. Hence, c(Pn) = c(Ln). We show that c1(Ln) is a generator
of H2
Z(CPn). For that purpose, we write down the integral Gysin sequence of the
realiﬁcation (Ln)R endowed with the induced orientation and with the Riemannian
ﬁbre metric induced from the standard scalar product on Cn+1

SLn = {(p, z) ∈CPn × Cn+1 : z ∈p , ∥z∥= 1} = {(p, z) ∈CPn×S2n+1 : z ∈p} ,
we can deﬁne mutually inverse continuous mappings
SLn →S2n+1 , (p, z) 
→z ,
S2n+1 →SLn , z

That is, SLn is homeomorphic to S2n+1. Hence, for k < 2n −1, the Gysin sequence
splits into the pieces

(4.2.22)
By setting k = 0, we obtain that c1(Ln) = c1(Pn) is a generator of H2
Z(CPn). Thus,
H∗
Z(CPn) is the free Abelian group generated by 1, c1(Ln), . . . , c1(Ln)n. As a special
case, we obtain that the ﬁrst Chern class of the complex Hopf bundle is a generator
of the second integral cohomology group of CP1 ∼= S2.

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
The arguments given for CPn can be adapted to RPn and HPn. This leads to the
following results (Exercise 4.2.18).
1. The ﬁrst Stiefel-Whitney class of the canonical O(1)-bundle PR
n (canonical real
line bundle LR
n ) over RPn is a generator of H1
Z2(RPn) and hence H∗
Z2(RPn) is
the Z2-module freely generated by 1, w1(LR
n ), . . . , w1(LR
n )n. In particular, the
ﬁrst Stiefel-Whitney class of the real Hopf bundle is a generator of the ﬁrst
Z2-cohomology group of RP1 ∼= S1.
2. The ﬁrst Pontryagin class of the canonical Sp(1)-bundle PH
n (canonical quater-
nionic line bundle LH
n ) over HPn is a generator of H1
Z(HPn) and hence H∗
Z(HPn)
is the free Abelian group generated by 1, p1(LH
n ), . . . , p1(LH
n )n. In particular, the
ﬁrst Pontryagin class of the quaternionic Hopf bundle is a generator of the fourth
integral cohomology group of HP1 ∼= S4.
♦
To conclude this section, we give a survey of the integral cohomology of BO(n) and
BSO(n). This was worked out independently in [107, 193]. We will conﬁne ourselves
to citing the result and adding a comment on how to derive it using Gysin sequences.

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
The universal Pontryagin and integral Stiefel-Whitney classes deﬁne characteristic
classes for principal O(n)-bundles, principal SO(n)-bundles and real vector bundles.
These are denoted, respectively, by pk(P), p(P), WI(P), pk(E), p(E), and WI(E). In
addition, the universal Euler class deﬁnes a characteristic class for principal SO(n)-
bundles and for oriented real vector bundles, denoted by e(P) and e(E), respectively,
where the latter is due to the fact that ESO(n) ×SO(n) Rn is universal for oriented real
vector bundles.

1. In terms of the integral cohomology class W
O(n)
{ 1

1 ), the necessary ori-
entability condition of Corollary 4.2.17 reads as follows. If a principal O(n)-
bundle P admits a reduction to the subgroup SO(n), then W{ 1
2 }(P) = 0. If a real
vector bundle E is orientable, then W{ 1
2 }(E) = 0.
2. By analogy with the structure groups U(n) and Sp(n), using the natural homo-
morphism H4k
Z (M) →Hom(H4k(M), Z), for every principal O(n)-bundle P and
every real vector bundle E one can deﬁne the Pontryagin indices pk,i(P) and
pk,i(E), respectively, relative to a given set of generators of H4k(M).

2. Theorem 4.2.23 and the relations given in point 1 can be proved by fairly elemen-
tary means, using the Gysin sequence with integral coefﬁcients of the oriented
universal vector bundle ESO(n) ×SO(n) Rn to derive H∗
Z(BSO(n)) and the Gysin
sequence with local coefﬁcients for the (non-oriented) universal vector bundle
EO(n) ×O(n) Rn to derive H∗
Z(BO(n)) from H∗
Z(BSO(n)).
3. In view of the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem for cohomology in the form of
Theorem 5.5.10 of [598], point 1 of Corollary 4.2.24 implies that it sufﬁces to
control the real and the Z2-valued cohomology of BSO(n) and BO(n). While the
latter is given by Theorems 4.2.11 and 4.2.14, the former can be read off from
point 2 of Corollary 4.2.24. Thus, H∗
R(BSO(n)) is the polynomial ring over R in
the Pontryagin classes p

Whitney Sum Formula and Splitting Principle
We start with deriving the Whitney Sum Formula. This formula expresses the char-
acteristic classes of the direct sum of vector bundles in terms of the characteristic
classes of the constituents.
In the course of the discussion, we will use that the classifying space of a direct
product of Lie groups G1 × G2 can be realised by BG1 × BG2. Recall that for ele-
ments αi ∈Hk
Z(BGi), the cohomology cross product α1 × α2 ∈Hk+l
Z (BG1 × BG2)
is deﬁned by
α1 × α2 := (pr∗
1 α1) ∪(pr∗
2 α2) ,
(4.3.1)
where pri : BG1 × BG2 →BGi for i = 1, 2 denotes the natural projection to the
i-th factor. For further use, we note that
(α1 × α2) ∪(β1 × β2) = (−1)deg(α2) deg(β1)(α1 ∪β1) × (α2 ∪β2) .
(4.3.2)
Moreover, for the diagonal mapping ΔB : B →B × B,
Δ∗
B(α1 × α2) = α1 ∪α2 .
(4.3.3)
The Whitney Sum Formula will be a consequence of the following.
Theorem 4.3.1
For the standard blockwise embeddings
jO : O(n1) × O(n2) →O(n1 + n2) ,
jU : U(n1) × U(n2) →U(n1 + n2) ,
jSp : Sp(n1) × Sp(n2) →Sp(n1 + n2) ,
one has

Analogous formulae hold for the special orthogonal and the special unitary groups
(Exercise 4.3.2).
Proof To be deﬁnite, we give the proof for the unitary groups and leave the rest to
the reader. Let us write j ≡jU and n = n1 + n2 and let us put c

prove (4.3.4) by induction on n, starting with n = k. Thus, let k be chosen and let
n1, n2 be such that n = k. Consider the pullback principal U(n)-bundle (Bj)∗EU(n).
By deﬁnition of Bj, it is vertically isomorphic to the associated principal U(n)-
bundle P :=

a vertical isomorphism

Consider a given i with 0 ≤i ≤k. Since k < n = n1 + n2, either i < n1 or k −i <
n2. Without loss of generality, we give the argument for the ﬁrst case and leave it to
the reader to adapt this to the second case. Replacing n1 by i in the above argument,
we obtain homomorphisms

Let

α(E1 ⊕E2) = α(E1)α(E2) ,
where α stands for the total Stiefel-Whitney class w in case K = R, for the total
Chern class c in case K = C and for the total symplectic Pontryagin class p in case
K = H.
Proof As before, we give the proof for the complex case. Let ni be the rank of Ei and
let n = n1 + n2. Choose auxiliary ﬁbre metrics on E1 and E2. Their orthogonal direct
sum deﬁnes a ﬁbre metric on E1 ⊕E2. Let Pi and P⊕denote the corresponding ortho-
normal frame bundles of Ei and E1 ⊕E2, respectively. Pi has structure group U(ni)
and P⊕has structure group U(n). Choose classifying mappings fi : B →BU(ni) for
Pi and f⊕: B →BU(n) for P⊕. By deﬁnition,

-bundle P1 ×B P2. It has the classifying map-
ping (f1 × f2) ◦Δ, where Δ : B →B × B is the diagonal mapping. By combining
orthonormal frames in (E1)b with orthonormal frames in (E2)b to orthonormal frames
in (E1 ⊕E2)b = (E1)b ⊕(E2)b, we obtain a vertical morphism of principal bundles
P1 ×B P2 →P⊕with associated Lie group homomorphism given by the standard
blockwise embedding j : U(n1) × U(n2) →U(n). Hence, Proposition 3.7.6 yields
that f⊕is homotopic to Bj ◦(f1 × f2) ◦Δ. Using this, together with formula (4.3.8)

Recall that two K-vector bundles E1, E2 over a topological space B are said to be
stably equivalent if there exist non-negative integers r1, r2 such that E1 ⊕(B × Kr1)
is vertically isomorphic to E2 ⊕(B × Kr2).
Corollary 4.3.3 Stably equivalent real (complex, quaternionic) vector bundles have
the same Stiefel-Whitney (Chern, symplectic Pontryagin) classes.
Proof We give the argument for the complex case. Let E1 and E2 be complex vector
bundles over B. If the vector bundles E1 ⊕(B × Cr1) and E2 ⊕(B × Cr2) are ver-
tically isomorphic, they have the same Chern class. By Remark 4.1.6/2, we have
c(M × Cri) = 1. Hence, the Whitney Sum Formula implies

This yields the assertion.
■
Corollary 4.3.3 implies that the Chern (Stiefel-Whitney, Pontryagin) classes yield
invariants in complex (real, quaternionic) K-theory.
Another important consequence of the Whitney Sum Formula is the following.
Let σk(x1, . . . , xn) denote the elementary symmetric polynomial of order k in the
indeterminates x1, . . . , xn, that is,
σk(x1, . . . , xn) =

i1<···<ik
xi1 · · · xik .
Corollary 4.3.4 Let K = R, C or H and let L1, . . . , Ln be K-line bundles over a
topological space B. Then,
αk (L1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ln) = σk

α1(L1), . . . , α1(Ln)

,
where α = w in case K = R, α = c in case K = C and α = p in case K = H.
Proof Let E := L1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ln. In the complex case, by the Whitney Sum Formula,
c(E) =
n

i=1
c(Li) .
By plugging in c(Li) = 1 + c1(Li) and expanding the product, we obtain

The real and the quaternionic case are analogous.
■
The characteristic classes c1(L1), . . . , c1(Ln) are referred to as the Chern roots of E.
By analogy, one speaks of the Stiefel-Whitney roots of E in the real case and the
Pontryagin roots of E in the quaternionic case. Thus, Corollary 4.3.4 states that if a
complex vector bundle splits into a sum of line bundles, its Chern classes are given
by the elementary symmetric polynomials in the ﬁrst Chern classes of its factors,
and that analogous statements hold for real and quaternionic vector bundles.
Behind Corollary 4.3.4, there is a relation between the corresponding universal
characteristic classes, which we now derive from Theorem 4.3.1. We show that by
iterated application of this theorem, we can embed H∗
Z(BU(n)) into H∗
Z(BU(1)n),

coefﬁcients in Z coincides with the polynomial ring generated over Z by the elemen-
tary symmetric polynomials [399, Sect.IV.6], it follows that (BjU
n)∗is injective and
that its image is the subring of H∗

In view of Corollary 4.1.4 and the fact that a principal G-bundle P admits a reduction

of a reduction Q are referred to
as the Chern roots of P. By analogy, one speaks of the Stiefel-Whitney roots of P in
case of the structure group O(n) and the Pontryagin roots of P in case of the structure
group Sp(n).
Next, we prove that the situation of Corollaries 4.3.4 and 4.3.6 can be achieved
for every vector bundle and every principal bundle with structure group O(n), U(n)
or Sp(n) by passing to an appropriate pullback bundle. This result is known as the
Splitting Principle. We treat the case of principal bundles ﬁrst.
Theorem 4.3.7 (Splitting Principle for principal bundles) Let G = O(n), U(n) or
Sp(n) and let H denote, respectively, the subgroup O(1)n, U(1)n or Sp(1)n. Let P be
a principal G-bundle over a topological space B and let ρ : P/H →B denote the
induced projection. Let R = Z2 for G = O(n) and R = Z for G = U(n) or Sp(n).
1. The principal G-bundle ρ∗P over P/H admits a reduction to the subgroup H.
2. The induced homomorphism ρ∗: H∗
R(B) →H∗
R(P/H) is injective.
Proof 1. Let pr : P →P/H denote the natural projection to classes. One can check
that the mapping
P →ρ∗P ,
p 
→

pr(p), p

,
is well deﬁned and yields a reduction of ρ∗P to the subgroup H.
2. The proof boils down to another application of the Leray-Hirsch Theorem. To
be deﬁnite, we give it for G = U(n). Let Ψ denote the action of U(n) on P. Deﬁne
Q0 := P/

{1} × U(n −1)

,
Y0 := P/

Clearly, Q0 is a principal U(1)-bundle over Y0 and Y0 is a ﬁbre bundle over B with

U(1) × U(n −1)
 ∼= CPn−1 .
Let ρ0 : Y0 →B denote the induced projection. Choose p ∈P and let m = π(p). The
mapping Ψp : U(n) →P induced by Ψ is equivariant with respect to the action of
U(1) × U(n −1) on U(n) by right translation and thus descends to a mapping
j : CPn−1 →Y0
of CPn−1 onto the ﬁbre (Y0)m. Consider the induced principal U(1)-bundle j∗Q0 over
CPn−1. One can check that the mapping

{1} × U(n −1)
 ∼= S2n−1 as its bundle space,8 onto j∗Q0 (Exercise 4.3.3).
According to Example 4.2.18, then the cohomology classes
1, c1(j∗Q0), . . . , c1(j∗Q0)n−1
form a free basis of H∗
Z(CPn−1) as a Z-module. Since c1(j∗Q0) = j∗c1(Q0), the
Leray-Hirsch Theorem 4.1.7 implies that the cohomology classes
1, c1(Q0), . . . , c1(Q0)n−1
form a free basis of H∗
Z(Y0) as a module over H∗
Z(B). In particular, the mapping
H∗
Z(B) →H∗
Z(Y0) given by α 
→α · 1 is injective. Since α · 1 = ρ∗
0α, this means
that the induced homomorphism ρ∗
0 : H∗
Z(B) →H∗
Z(Y0) is injective.
Now, in the above argument, we replace the principal U(n)-bundle P over B by
the principal U(n −1)-bundle P1 := P/

over Y0. This yields a ﬁbre

of E. Choose a ﬁbre metric on E and consider the corresponding orthonormal frame
bundle O(E), which is a principal U(n)-bundle over B. Deﬁne Y := O(E)/U(1)n and
8In fact, this is the Stiefel bundle SC(1, n) →GC(1, n).

4.3 Whitney Sum Formula and Splitting Principle

let ρ : Y →B denote the induced projection. Then, Y is a ﬁbre bundle over B, with
typical ﬁbre U(n)/U(1)n. Point 2 of Theorem 4.3.7 yields point 2 of the corollary.
By point 1 of that theorem, ρ∗O(E) admits a reduction Q to the subgroup U(1)n.
Then, on the one hand, using Propositions 1.6.7 and 1.2.5/2 and Theorem 3.6.8, we
obtain the vertical isomorphisms
Q ×U(1)n Cn ∼=

ρ∗O(E)

where U(1)n acts on Ci via multiplication by the i-th entry.
■
Remark 4.3.9 According to the proof of Corollary 4.3.8, if E has rank n, the ﬁbre
bundle ρ : Y →B of Corollary 4.3.8 can be chosen to have typical ﬁbre O(n)/O(1)n
in case K = R, U(n)/U(1)n in case K = C and Sp(n)/Sp(1)n in case K = H.
♦
The Splitting Principle implies that for proving an algebraic relation between the
Chern (Stiefel-Whitney, Pontryagin) classes of complex (real, quaternionic) vec-
tor bundles, it sufﬁces to prove this relation under the assumption that all bundles
involved are sums of line bundles. Let us illustrate this by deriving a formula for the
total Chern class of a tensor product of complex vector bundles.
Deﬁne a polynomial Tn,m in the real variables x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , ym by
Tn,m(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym) :=
n

i=1
m

j=1
(1 + xi + yj) .
(4.3.10)
Since Tn,m is symmetric under separate permutations of the xi and the yj, it can be
written in the form
Tn,m(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym)
=Pn,m

σ1(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , σn(x1, . . . , xn) , σ1(y1, . . . , ym), . . . , σm(y1, . . . , ym)

with a unique polynomial in n + m variables Pn,m. For the explicit form of Pn,m, see
Remark 4.3.12.
Proposition 4.3.10 For complex vector bundles E of rank n and F of rank m over a
topological space B, one has
c(E ⊗F) = Pn,m

c1(E), . . . , cn(E), c1(F), . . . , cm(F)

.
Proof By the Splitting Principle, it sufﬁces to prove the assertion under the assump-
tion that E = n
i=1 Li and F = m
j=1 Kj for appropriate line bundles Li and Kj.
According to Corollary 4.3.4, then

Thus, we have to show that
c(E ⊗F) = Tn,m

.
By the Whitney Sum Formula,
c(E ⊗F) =

c(Li ⊗Kj) .
Hence, the proof boils down to showing that for arbitrary line bundles L and K, one
has
c1(L ⊗K) = c1(L) + c1(K) .
(4.3.11)
To prove this, we use that L ⊗K can be written as an associated vector bundle as fol-
lows. We may assume that L and K are associated with principal U(1)-bundles P and
Q, respectively, via the basic representation of U(1) on C. Consider the ﬁbre product
P ×B Q. This is a principal (U(1) × U(1))-bundle over B. Since U(1) is Abelian,
the multiplication mapping μ : U(1) × U(1) →U(1) is a group homomorphism.
Hence, we can form the associated principal U(1)-bundle (P ×B Q)[μ] and, in turn,
the associated line bundle
E =

(P ×B Q)[μ]
×U(1) C ,
where U(1) acts on C in the basic representation. We leave it to the reader to show
that the mapping (P × C) ×B (Q × C) →

According to Remark 3.4.22 and Proposition 3.7.2/1, if P and Q have classifying

4.3 Whitney Sum Formula and Splitting Principle
295
Plugging this into (4.3.13), we obtain (4.3.11).
■
From the proof we extract the formula for the Chern class of the tensor product of
complex line bundles L1 and L2 over B,
c(L1 ⊗L2) = 1 + c1(L1) + c1(L2) .
(4.3.15)
In combination with the Splitting Principle, this formula allows for computing the
Chern class of the dual vector bundle. To formulate the result, deﬁne the conjugate
universal Chern classes and the conjugate total universal Chern class by, respectively,
c
U(n)
k

U(n)

(4.3.16)
There correspond the conjugate Chern classes of principal U(n)-bundles and of com-
plex vector bundles.
Corollary 4.3.11 For the dual bundle E∗of a complex vector bundle E, one has
c(E∗) = c(E) .
Proof By the Splitting Principle, it sufﬁces to prove the assertion for the case where
E is a sum of line bundles, E = L1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ln. Then, E∗= L∗
1 ⊕· · · ⊕L∗
n. By the
Whitney Sum Formula,
c(E) =

1 + c1(L1)

1 + c1(Ln)

,
c(E∗) =

1 + c1(L∗
1)

· · ·

1 + c1(L∗
n)

.
To compute c1(L∗
i ), we observe that Li ⊗L∗
i ∼= End(Li) and that End(Li) is trivial,
because the identity homomorphisms of the ﬁbres of Li combine to a global nonzero
section. Hence, c1(Li ⊗L∗
i ) = 0 and (4.3.15) implies
c1(L∗
i ) = −c1(Li) ,
i = 1, . . . , n .
Thus, the Chern classes of E and E∗built from an even number of factors c1(Li)
coincide and those built from an odd number have opposite sign.
■
Remark 4.3.12 In concrete situations, the polynomial Pn,m may be read off directly
from Tn,m by expanding the product and expressing everything in terms of elementary
symmetric polynomials. For example, for m = 1, one ﬁnds

♦
Example 4.3.13 As an application, we consider a principal SU(n)-bundle P and
determine the second Chern class of the complexiﬁcation of the adjoint bundle
Ad(P) = P ×SU(n) su(n). We have

Ad(P)

C = P ×SU(n) sl(n, C) ,
where the action of SU(n) on sl(n, C) may be viewed as being induced from the repre-
sentation of SU(2) on the vector space End(Cn) deﬁned by conjugation. The natural
isomorphism End(Cn) ∼= Cn ⊗(Cn)∗intertwines this representation with the tensor
product of the basic representation of SU(n) with its dual representation. Hence, this
natural isomorphism embeds sl(n, C) as an invariant subspace of codimension 1 in
Cn ⊗(Cn)∗. By complete reducibility, the representation of SU(n) on sl(n, C) thus
differs from that on Cn ⊗(Cn)∗by taking the direct sum with a one-dimensional
representation. Since the latter is necessarily trivial, it follows that

Ad(P)

C dif-
fers from P ×SU(n)

Cn ⊗(Cn)∗
by taking the direct sum with a trivial line bun-
dle. By Corollary 4.3.3, the two bundles have the same Chern classes then. Now,
P ×SU(n)

Cn ⊗(Cn)∗
is vertically isomorphic to E ⊗E∗, where E = P ×SU(n) Cn
with SU(n) acting in the basic representation. Thus, formula (4.3.19), Corollary
4.3.11 and the identity c(E) = c(P) imply

For a ∈Mn(C), let a denote the matrix obtained from a by taking the complex
conjugate of every entry. The mapping

κ(a) := a ,

multiplication by scalars as
z · y := z y ,
z ∈C , y ∈E .

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
With this new multiplication and the original ﬁbrewise additive structure, E is a
complex vector bundle of the same rank. It is called the conjugate vector bundle of
E and is denoted by E. Let us point out the following. While the real vector bundles
ER and ER obtained by ﬁeld restriction from E and E, respectively, are identical,
their induced orientations coincide only if the rank of E is even, and are opposite
otherwise. The reason is that the induced orientation of ER is deﬁned by ordered local
frames of the form (e1, ie1, . . . , en, ien), whereas that of ER is deﬁned by ordered
local frames of the form
(e1, i · e1, . . . , en, i · en) = (e1, −ie1, . . . , en, −ien) ,
where in both cases, (e1, . . . , en) is an ordered local frame in E (and hence in E).
Recall that c denotes the conjugate Chern class, cf. formula (4.3.16).
Proposition 4.4.1 (Complex conjugation)
1. One has (Bκ)∗cU(n) = c
U(n).
2. For every complex vector bundle E, one has c(E) = c(E).
Proof 1. By deﬁnition, Bκ : BU(k) →BU(k) is the classifying mapping of the asso-
ciated principal U(k)-bundle P := EU(k) ×U(k) U(k), where U(k) acts on itself by
left translation via κ. Hence,
(Bκ)∗c
U(k)
k
= ck(P) .
By Remark 4.2.4/1,
ck(P) = e(ER) .
Here, ER denotes the oriented real vector bundle induced by the complex vector
bundle E := P ×U(k) Ck with U(k) acting on Ck in the basic representation. We
leave it to the reader to check that the mapping
F : ER →E
U
k ,
F

[( [(y, a)] , z )]

:= [(y, a z)] ,
is well deﬁned and that it yields a vertical real vector bundle isomorphism. If
(e1, . . . , ek) is an ordered local frame in E, then

F(e1), . . . , F(ek)

is an ordered
local frame in EU
k and


F(e1), −iF(e1), . . . , F(ek), −iF(ek)

It follows that F preserves the orientations iff k is even. Hence,

2. Choose an auxiliary ﬁbre metric h on E. Composition of h with subsequent
complex conjugation yields a ﬁbre metric h on E. An h-orthonormal frame in E
is, at the same time, an h-orthonormal frame in E. Hence, as a set, O(E) coincides
with O(E), and the identical mapping deﬁnes a vertical isomorphism of principal
U(n)-bundles with Lie group homomorphism κ. Then, Corollary 4.1.4 and point 1

■
If E is a real vector bundle, the complex vector bundles EC and EC are vertically
isomorphic via (A.12). Hence, point 2 of Proposition 4.4.1 implies the following.
Corollary 4.4.2 For a real vector bundle E one has 2c2k+1(EC) = 0.
■
Remark 4.4.3 Comparing point 2 of Proposition 4.4.1 with Corollary 4.3.11, we see
that c(E) = c(E∗). This is not surprising, because for every Hermitean ﬁbre metric
h on E, the mapping E →E∗deﬁned by assigning to y ∈Em the linear functional
on Em given by y′ 
→h(y, y′) is a vertical isomorphism of complex vector bundles.
In fact, one may use this argument to deduce either one of the two assertions from
the other one.
♦
Now, we turn to the discussion of the relations between real, complex and quater-
nionic characteristic classes. In effect, this amounts to calculating the homomor-
phisms induced in cohomology by the classifying mappings of the Lie subgroup

about ﬁeld restriction and ﬁeld extension needed below, we refer to Appendix A.
We start with the case of ﬁeld restriction, that is, with the homomorphisms induced
by the classifying mappings of the embeddings (4.4.2). For G = O(n) and G =
Sp(n), deﬁne the conjugate universal Pontryagin classes and the conjugate total

acting via j
U,O
k , and view EU
k as the real vector bundle obtained from the complex vector
bundle EO(2k) ×U(k) Ck by ﬁeld restriction. Then, by taking the direct product of
the identical mapping of EO(2k) with the real vector space isomorphism Ck →R2k
given by (4.2.1) and passing to quotients, we obtain a real vector bundle morphism
F : EU

Corollary 4.4.6 For a principal SO(2n)-bundle to admit a reduction to the sub-
group U(n), its Stiefel-Whitney classes must vanish in odd degree. For a princi-
pal SO(4n)-bundle to admit a reduction to the subgroup Sp(n), its Stiefel-Whitney
classes must vanish in any degree not divisible by 4. For a principal SU(2n)-bundle
to admit a reduction to the subgroup Sp(n), its Chern classes must vanish in degrees
2 mod 4.

Proof We give the proof for point 1. The other points are analogous. Choose an
auxiliary ﬁbre metric on E and consider the induced ﬁbre metric on ER, deﬁned
ﬁbrewise by (A.9). According to Lemma A.1/2, there exists a vertical morphism
of principal bundles O(E) →O(ER) with Lie group homomorphism jU,O

Corollary 4.4.8 For a real vector bundle to admit a complex (quaternionic) struc-
ture, its Stiefel-Whitney classes must vanish in odd degree (any degree not divisible
by 4).9 For a complex vector bundle to admit a quaternionic structure, its Chern
classes must vanish in degrees 2 mod 4.

Now, we turn to the discussion of the relations between Chern, Pontryagin and
Stiefel-Whitney classes which arise by ﬁeld extension. That is, we calculate the
homomorphisms induced by the classifying mappings of the embeddings (4.4.3).

In particular, the contributions to the right hand sides of (4.4.10), (4.4.12) and (4.4.14)
do indeed vanish in the degrees required by the corresponding left hand sides.

with the diagonal mapping ΔO(n) : O(n) →O(n) × O(n) and the standard blockwise

In view of Corollary 4.1.4, Proposition 4.4.9 implies the following.

p(EH) = ˆp(E)2 + W{ 1

3. For the quaternionic vector bundle EH obtained from a complex vector bundle E
by ﬁeld extension, one has p(EH) = c(E)c(E) .
Proof We give the argument for point 1. Choose an auxiliary Riemannian ﬁbre
metric h on E and let hC be the induced Hermitean ﬁbre metric on EC, deﬁned by
(A.13). According to Lemma A.2/2, there exists a vertical principal bundle morphism
O(E) →O(EC) with Lie group homomorphism jO,U
n . Now, the rest of the proof is
analogous to that of Corollary 4.4.7.
■
Combining point 1 of Corollary 4.4.12 with the Whitney Sum Formula for the
Chern class of complex vector bundles, we obtain a Whitney Sum Formula for the
Pontryagin class of real vector bundles.
Corollary 4.4.13 For real vector bundles E1 and E2 over M, one has
p(E1 ⊕E2)
= p(E1)p(E2) +

W{ 1
2 }(E1)p(E1) + W(E1)2 
W{ 1
2 }(E2)p(E2) + W(E2)2
(4.4.18)
Proof According to Corollary 4.4.12/1, Theorem 4.3.2 implies
ˆp(E1 ⊕E2) + W{ 1
2 }(E1 ⊕E2)p(E1 ⊕E2) + W(E1 ⊕E2)2
=

ˆp(E1) + W{ 1
2 }(E1)p(E1) + W(E1)2 
ˆp(E2) + W{ 1
2 }(E2)p(E2) + W(E2)2
Taking this equality in degree 0 mod 4 and changing signs in degree 4 mod 8, we
obtain the assertion.
■
Remark 4.4.14 In the case where E1 and E2 are orientable, according to Remark
4.2.22/1, the Whitney Sum Formula (4.4.18) reads
p(E1 ⊕E2) = p(E1)p(E2) + W(E1)2W(E2)2 .
(4.4.19)
In the general case, by passing to real coefﬁcients, from (4.4.18) we obtain
p(E1 ⊕E2) = p(E1)p(E2) in H∗
R(M) .
(4.4.20)
Alternatively, this can be read off directly from the Whitney Sum Formula for the
Chern class with real coefﬁcients as follows. The argument proving point 1 of Corol-
lary 4.4.12 shows that ˆpk(E) = c2k(EC) in H∗
Z(M). Combining this with Corollary

4.4 Field Restriction and Field Extension
307
4.4.2, we obtain ˆp(E) = c(EC) in H∗
R(M). Hence, the Whitney Sum Formula for c
yields ˆp(E1 ⊕E2) = ˆp(E1)ˆp(E2), which entails (4.4.20).
Let us add that this argument may be complemented as follows to provide an
alternative proof of (4.4.18), which uses computations in real and Z2-valued coho-
mology only. Since every torsion element of H∗
Z(BO(n)) has order 2, in addition to
(4.4.20), it sufﬁces to prove (4.4.18) under reduction mod 2. Using the ﬁrst formula
in Corollary 4.4.12/1, from

where wodd(E) = w1(E) + w3(E) + · · · (Exercise 4.4.3). This is the mod 2 reduction
of (4.4.18), indeed.
♦
Finally, we ﬁnd the following.
Corollary 4.4.15 Stably equivalent real vector bundles have the same Pontryagin
and integral Stiefel-Whitney classes.
Proof For the Pontryagin classes, this follows from the corresponding statement
about the Chern classes in Corollary 4.3.3 by taking the second formula in point 1
of Corollary 4.4.12 in degree 4k. For the integral Stiefel-Whitney classes, it follows
from the corresponding statement about the ordinary Stiefel-Whitney classes in the
same corollary and naturality of the Bockstein homomorphism.

Characteristic Classes for Manifolds
Via the tangent bundle, the characteristic classes for real or complex vector bun-
dles deﬁne characteristic classes for manifolds. If M is a smooth real manifold of
dimension n, the Stiefel-Whitney classes of M are deﬁned by
wi(M) := wi(TM) ,
i = 1, . . . , n ,
and the Pontryagin classes of M are deﬁned by
pi(M) := pi(TM) ,
i = 1, . . . , ¯qn = ⌊n
2⌋.
If M, and thus TM, is oriented, we can deﬁne the Euler class by
e(M) := e(TM) .
By summing over the Stiefel-Whitney and Pontryagin classes, we obtain the total
Stiefel-Whitney class w(M) and the total Pontryagin class p(M), respectively.
If the tangent bundle of M carries an additional structure, like a complex or a
quaternionic structure, one can deﬁne further characteristic classes and apply the
appropriate relations of the previous section. In particular, if dim(M) = 2n and if
TM carries a complex structure, and thus M is an almost complex manifold, we can
deﬁne the Chern classes of M by
ci(M) := ci(TM) ,
i = 1, . . . , n ,
where TM is viewed as a complex vector bundle. Then, Propositions 4.4.4 and 4.4.9
yield
w2i−1(M) = 0 ,
w2i(M) = ρ2

ci(M)

,
i = 1, . . . , n .
In particular, this applies if M is a complex manifold of complex dimension n.
Analogously, if dim(M) = 4n and if TM carries a quaternionic structure, we can
deﬁne the symplectic Pontryagin classes of M by
p
Sp
i (M) := pi(TM) ,
i = 1, . . . , n ,
where TM is viewed as a quaternionic vector bundle. Here, for i = 1, . . . , n and
d = 1, 2, 3, Propositions 4.4.4 and 4.4.9 yield
w4i−d(M) = 0 ,
w4i(M) = ρ2

Example 4.5.1 For a parallelizable manifold, TM is trivial and hence wk(M) = 0
and pk(M) = 0 for all k > 0. This applies in particular to Lie groups.

4.5 Characteristic Classes for Manifolds

Example 4.5.2 Consider M = Sn, realized as the unit sphere in Rn+1. Recall that the
tangent space of Sn at x can be realized as the subspace of Rn+1 orthogonal to x. Thus,
by attaching to x ∈Sn the subspace of Rn+1 spanned by x, we obtain a realization
of the normal bundle NSn of the submanifold Sn ⊂Rn+1. This bundle is trivial,
because by assigning to each point x ∈Sn the vector x ∈NxSn, we obtain a nowhere
vanishing section. Hence, TSn is stably equivalent to the trivial vector bundle TSn ⊕
NSn ∼= (TRn+1)↾Sn = Sn × Rn+1. By Corollaries 4.3.3 and 4.4.15, then wk(Sn) = 0
and pk(Sn) = 0 for all k > 0.
♦
Example 4.5.3 We determine the characteristic classes of M = KPn. First, we com-
pute the Chern classes of CPn. For that purpose, recall that we may view CPn both
as the manifold of one-dimensional subspaces of Cn+1 and as the quotient manifold
of the action of U(1) on the submanifold S2n+1 ⊂Cn+1 of unit vectors. Moreover,
recall that the tangent space of S2n+1 at x can be realized as the real subspace of Cn+1
orthogonal to x with respect to the scalar product (A.9) induced on the real vector
space Cn+1
R
by the standard scalar product on Cn+1.
We start with deriving a description of the tangent bundle T(CPn). Let Ln denote
the tautological line bundle over CPn, viewed as a vertical vector subbundle of
the trivial complex vector bundle CPn × Cn+1. Let E be the vector subbundle of
CPn × Cn+1 given by the orthogonal complements of the ﬁbres of Ln with respect to
the standard complex scalar product on Cn+1. Let p ∈CPn and let λ : (Ln)p →Ep
be a linear mapping. Choose an element x of the subspace p such that ∥x∥= 1.
Then, x ∈S2n+1 ⊂Cn+1 and λ(x) ∈TxS2n+1, because orthogonality in Cn+1 implies
orthogonalityinCn+1
R ,andsoEp ⊂TxS2n+1.Letpr : S2n+1 →CPn denotethenatural
projection to U(1)-orbits. Then, pr′ ◦λ(x) ∈TpCPn. If y is another element of the
subspace p with ∥y∥= 1, there exists α ∈U(1) such that y = αx. Then, by linearity
of λ,
pr′ ◦λ(y) = pr′ 
αλ(x)

= pr′ 
λ(x)

.
Hence, the assignment of pr′ ◦λ(x) to λ deﬁnes a mapping
Φ : Hom(Ln, E) →T(CPn)
and this mapping is a vertical complex vector bundle morphism. It is not hard to
see that Ep together with the value at x of the Killing vector ﬁeld of i ∈u(1) span
TxS2n+1 over the reals. Hence, Φ is ﬁbrewise surjective. By counting dimensions,
we then ﬁnd that Φ is a vertical isomorphism of complex vector bundles.
Now, since E ⊕Ln = CPn × Cn+1, we have
Hom(Ln, E) ⊕End(Ln) ∼= Hom(Ln, E ⊕Ln) = Hom(Ln, CPn×Cn+1) ∼=
n+1

k=1
L∗
n .
Since the endomorphism bundle of a line bundle is always trivial, because the identi-
cal mappings of the ﬁbres deﬁne a nowhere vanishing section, it follows that T(CPn)
is stably equivalent to the (n + 1)-fold direct sum of the dual bundle L∗
n. As a result,

(4.5.1)
Finally, by Example 4.2.18, c1(Ln) is a generator of H2
Z(CPn) and hence a ring
generator of H∗
Z(CPn). Thus, if we choose α = −c1(Ln) ≡c1(L∗
n) as a generator,
then (4.5.1) reads
c(CPn) = (1 + α)n+1 .
(4.5.2)
Since α has degree 2 and CPn has dimension 2n, the highest order term of the right
hand side is (n + 1)αn and not αn+1.
We leave it to the reader to adapt the arguments given for CPn to RPn (Exercise
4.5.1). As a result,
w(RPn) = (1 + α)n+1 ,
(4.5.3)
where α is the ﬁrst Stiefel-Whitney class of the canonical (real) line bundle over
RPn. According to Example 4.2.18, α is a generator of H1
Z2(RPn) and hence a ring
generator of H∗
Z2(RPn).
For HPn, the argument is slightly different. This has to do with the fact that the
linear mappings between quaternionic vector spaces form a real vector space only.
This applies in particular to the dual space, although the latter may be endowed with a
natural left quaternionic vector space structure. By analogy with the complex case, we
take the tautological quaternionic line bundle over HPn and construct the quaternionic
orthogonal complement E together with the mapping Φ : Hom(Ln, E) →T(HPn).
As already mentioned, here Hom(Ln, E) is just a real vector bundle and Φ is an
isomorphism of real vector bundles. Accordingly, T(HPn) is stably equivalent to the
sum of real vector bundles n+1
k=1 L∗
n. Then, Corollary 4.4.15 implies
p(T(HPn)) = p(L∗
n)n+1 .
Using that L∗
n is vertically isomorphic to the real vector bundle obtained from Ln by
ﬁeld restriction,10 as well as Corollary 4.4.7/2, we obtain
p(T(HPn)) =

1 + p1((Ln)R)
n+1 =

1 + 2p1(Ln)
n+1 .
(4.5.4)
Thus,
p(HPn) = (1 + α)n+1 ,
(4.5.5)
where α is the ﬁrst Pontryagin class of the real vector bundle obtained from the
tautological (quaternionic) line bundle over HPn by ﬁeld restriction, or twice the ﬁrst
Pontryagin class of the tautological line bundle itself. According to Example 4.2.18,
the latter generates H∗
Z(HPn).
♦
10Every quaternionic Hermitean ﬁbre metric on Ln provides an isomorphism.

Remark 4.5.4 In case n = 1, the tautological line bundle L1 over KP1 is associated
with the K-Hopf bundle, which we denote by PK here. We use this and the results
of Example 4.5.3 to compute the ﬁrst Chern index c1(PC) of the complex Hopf bun-
dle PC and the ﬁrst Pontryagin index of the quaternionic Hopf bundle PH. First,
consider the complex Hopf bundle. Here, the base space is CP1. The second homol-
ogy group H2(CP1) is generated by a single element, which may be chosen to be
represented by the diffeomorphism s : S2 →CP1 deﬁned in Remark 1.1.21/3. To
compute c1(PC), we have to evaluate the integral cohomology class c(PC) = c(L1)
on [s]. On the one hand, according to Example 4.2.18, the class c1(L1) generates
H2
Z(CP1) and hence the corresponding homomorphism H2(CP1) →Z generates
Hom(H2(CP1), Z). Therefore, ⟨c1(PC), [s]⟩= ±1. On the other hand, by (4.5.1),
we have c1(T(CP1)) = −2c1(L1). Since c1(T(CP1)) is the top Chern class of the
complex vector bundle T(CP1), according to Remark 4.2.4/1, it coincides with the
integral Euler class of the oriented real vector bundle obtained by realiﬁcation. Since
the pullback of this orientation under s coincides with the standard orientation of
S2 deﬁned by the outward coorientation as a submanifold of R3, we conclude that
⟨c1(T(CP1)), [s]⟩is positive. As a result,
c1(PC) = ⟨c1(PC), [s]⟩= −1 .
TheargumentforthequaternionicHopfbundlePH issimilar.Wechoosethegenerator
of H4(HP1) to be represented by the diffeomorphism s : S4 →HP1 deﬁned in (B.1).
In contrast to the complex case, this diffeomorphism reverses the natural orientation
of HP1 deﬁned by the quaternionic structure on T(HP1). The reason behind is that
the latter is inherited from multiplication of elements of H2 by conjugate quaternions
from the left. However, the sign we pick up here cancels against the different sign in
(4.5.4), so that, in the end, we obtain an analogous result,
p1(PH) = ⟨p1(PH), [s]⟩= −1 .
For the Chern indices, this yields c1(PH) = 0 and c2(PH) = 1.

The Weil Homomorphism
In the present section, we give a geometric description of characteristic classes using
connection theory. This will be accomplished via the Weil homomorphism, which
allows for constructing characteristic classes in de Rham cohomology from polyno-
mial invariants of the structure group. Necessarily, we have to restrict attention to
smooth principal bundles P(M, G).
The Weil homomorphism will be deﬁned on the algebra PolG(g) of real-valued
Ad-invariant polynomials on the Lie algebra g of G. Recall that a function ξ : g →R

is said to be polynomial if it can be written as a polynomial in the expansion coefﬁ-
cients of its argument with respect to some basis in g. That is, relative to a basis {ta}
in g, the function ξ is a sum of functions ξk of the form
ξk(A) = ξk(Aata) = ξa1...akAa1 . . . Aak
(4.6.1)
(summation convention) with ξa1...ak ∈R. Here, A = Aata. The system ξa1...ak may be
assumed to be symmetric under permutation of indices. It is then uniquely determined
by ξ and transforms like a tensor under a change of basis. Clearly, the Ad-invariant
polynomial functions form a subalgebra of C∞(g), denoted by PolG(g). As a vector
space,
PolG(g) =

It is easy to see that the assignment f 
→ˆf extends to a homomorphism of algebras
from SymG(g) to PolG(g) (Exercise 4.6.1). This homomorphism is referred to as the
polarization homomorphism. One has the polarization formula

forms, see formula (2.4.17) in Part I. In many textbooks, the coefﬁcient in (4.6.2) is

corresponds to the other common choice of the wedge product. These different conventions lead to
different combinatorial factors on the way, but the ﬁnal formulae for the Chern classes will be the
same. We will comment on this at the end of this section in Remark 4.6.10/2.

Lemma 4.6.1 The polarization homomorphism is an isomorphism.
Proof Injectivity follows at once from the polarization formula (4.6.4). To prove
surjectivity, let ξ ∈PolG(g) be homogeneous of degree k. Choose a basis and write
ξ in the form (4.6.1) with symmetric coefﬁcients ξa1...ak. Deﬁne a k-linear form on g
by
f (A1, . . . , Ak) := k! ξa1...akAa1

This form is symmetric and fulﬁls ˆf = ξ. Finally, by the polarization formula (4.6.4),
invariance of ξ implies invariance of f .
■
The inverse of polarization is referred to as multilinearization. Given ξ ∈PolG(g),
the multilinearization of ξ will be denoted by ˇξ. By (4.6.4),

The further analysis uses invariant horizontal forms on P(M, G). Such forms con-
stitute a subalgebra of Ω∗(P), denoted by Ω∗
G,hor(P). They are related to forms on
M as follows.
Lemma 4.6.2 Let P be a principal G-bundle over M with projection π.
1. The homomorphism π∗maps Ω∗(M) isomorphically onto Ω∗
G,hor(P).
2. For all α ∈Ω∗
G,hor(P), one has dα ∈Ω∗
G,hor(P).
3. For all α ∈Ω∗
G,hor(P) and all connections ω on P, one has Dωα = dα.
Proof 1. Since π is a surjective submersion, π∗is injective. To see that π∗maps
Ω∗(M) onto all of Ω∗
G,hor(P), let α ∈Ω∗
G,hor(P) be given. It sufﬁces to give the
argument under the assumption that α is a 1-form. Choose a covering of M by
local sections si in P over Ui and consider the local k-forms s∗
i α on M. Let ρij :
Ui ∩Uj →G denote the transition mappings. They fulﬁl sj(m) = Ψρij(m)

deﬁned by (1.1.1). Then, for all p ∈π−1(Ui), one has p = Ψκi(p) ◦si ◦π(p) and hence

Now, let α ∈Ω2(P, g). Using multilinearization, we can assign to every ξ ∈Polk

(4.6.6)
The assignment ξ 
→hα(ξ) extends to a linear mapping hα : PolG(g) →Ω∗(P).
Remark 4.6.3 Let {ta} be a basis in g and let αa ∈Ω2(P) denote the corresponding
coefﬁcient 2-forms, deﬁned by α(Y1, Y2) = αa(Y1, Y2) ta for all p ∈P and Y1, Y2 ∈
TpP. By plugging this expansion into the deﬁnition of hα(p) for ξ ∈Polk
G(g), we
obtain
hα(ξ) = 2k ξa1,...,ak αa1 ∧· · · ∧αak ,
(4.6.7)
where ξa1,...,ak are the symmetric coefﬁcients of ξ deﬁned by (4.6.1). This implies
hα(ξ) = 2kξ ∧(α) ,
(4.6.8)
where ξ ∧means that all products in the polynomial ξ are replaced by the exterior
product.
♦
Lemma 4.6.4 Let α ∈Ω2(P, g).
1. The mapping hα : PolG(g) →Ω∗(P) is an algebra homomorphism, that is,
hα(ξζ) = hα(ξ) ∧hα(ζ) for all ξ, ζ ∈PolG(g) .

4.6 The Weil Homomorphism
315
2. For all ξ ∈PolG(g), the following holds true.
a. If α is of type Ad, then hα(ξ) is invariant.
b. If α is horizontal, then hα(ξ) is horizontal.
c. If Ω is the curvature form of a connection, then hΩ(ξ) is closed.
3. If F : Q →P is a morphism of principal G-bundles, then, for all ξ ∈PolG(g),
F∗hα(ξ) = hF∗α(ξ) .
Proof Points 2b and 3 are immediate. Point 2a follows from point 3 by using that α
is of type Ad and ξ is invariant. Point 1 is straightforward (Exercise 4.6.3). It remains
to prove point 2c. Assume that ξ is homogeneous of degree k. If Ω is the curvature
form of a connection ω, it is horizontal and of type Ad. Then, points 2a and 2b imply
that hΩ(ξ) is horizontal and invariant. Hence, Lemma 4.6.2/3 yields

ta = DωΩ = 0 and hence DωΩa = 0 for all a.
■
In view of points 2a and 2b of Lemma 4.6.4, if α is horizontal of type Ad, we
may compose hα with the inverse of the isomorphism π∗: Ω∗(M) →Ω∗
G,hor(P),
provided by Lemma 4.6.2/1, thus obtaining an algebra homomorphism
ˆhα : PolG(g) →Ω∗(M) .
By construction, ˆhα is determined by
π∗◦ˆhα = hα .
(4.6.9)
By point 2c of Lemma 4.6.4, if Ω is the curvature form of a connection, then ˆhΩ
takes values in the closed forms on M and thus induces a homomorphism
wP : PolG(g) →H∗

(4.6.10)
Lemma 4.6.5 If Ω0 and Ω1 are the curvature forms of connections on P, then
ˆhΩ1(ξ) −ˆhΩ0(ξ) is exact for all ξ ∈PolG(g).

(4.6.11)
Since β and Ωt are horizontal and of type Ad, so is φt. Hence, by Lemma 4.6.2/3,

As a result, the homomorphism (4.6.10) depends on the principal bundle P only and
not on the speciﬁc connection whose curvature form is used in the deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.6.6 The homomorphism wP is called the Weil homomorphism of P.
12See Remark 4.1.10/1 in Part I for the deﬁnitions of the integral and the derivative of a 1-parameter
family of differential forms and for the corresponding calculus.

4.6 The Weil Homomorphism
317
Let us study how the Weil homomorphism behaves under bundle morphisms.
For a Lie group homomorphism λ : G →H, let dλ : g →h denote the induced
homomorphism of Lie algebras. It is elementary to check that (dλ)∗maps PolH(h)
to PolG(g).
Proposition 4.6.7 Let P and Q be principal bundles over M and N with structure
groups G and H, respectively, and let ϑ : P →Q be a morphism with Lie group
homomorphism λ : G →H and projection f : M →N. Then,
wP ◦(dλ)∗= f ∗◦wQ .
Proof The morphism ϑ can be written as the composition of the vertical morphism
Φ : P →f ∗Q ,
Φ(p) :=

πP(p), ϑ(p)

whose Lie group homomorphism is given by λ with the natural principal H-bundle
morphism F : f ∗Q →Q covering f . It sufﬁces to prove that wP ◦(dλ)∗= wf ∗Q and
wf ∗Q = f ∗◦wQ.
To prove the ﬁrst formula, let ω be a connection form on P. By Proposition
1.3.13, ω induces a connection ˜ω on f ∗Q such that Φ∗˜ω = dλ ◦ω. Then, by Remark
1.4.10/2,
Φ∗˜Ω = dλ ◦Ω .
Using this, for ξ ∈Polk
G(h) and X1, . . . , X2k ∈X(P), we obtain
Φ∗
h ˜Ω(ξ)

It follows that ˆhΩ ◦(dλ)∗(ξ) = ˆh ˜Ω(ξ) and hence wP ◦(dλ)∗(ξ) = wf ∗Q(ξ).
To see that wf ∗Q = f ∗◦wQ, let ω be a connection form on Q and let Ω be its
curvature. By Corollary 1.3.16, F∗ω is a connection form on f ∗Q and by Remark
1.4.10/2, the curvature of this connection form is given by F∗Ω. By Lemma 4.6.4/3,
for ξ ∈PolH(h), then hF∗Ω(ξ) = F∗
hΩ(ξ)

. Using (4.6.9) and πQ ◦F = f ◦πf ∗Q,
we thus obtain

Corollary 4.6.8
1. Vertically isomorphic principal G-bundles deﬁne the same Weil homomorphism.
2. For every ξ ∈PolG(g), the assignment of wP(ξ) to P deﬁnes a characteristic
class for principal G-bundles with values in the de Rham cohomology.
3. If P is a principal G-bundle and λ : G →H is a Lie group homomorphism, then
wP[λ] = wP ◦(dλ)∗.
Proof Point 1 is immediate.
2. For a principal G-bundle P over M, write α(P) := wP(ξ). If f : N →M is
a smooth mapping, we have a natural morphism F : f ∗P →P covering f . Hence,
Proposition 4.6.7 yields wf ∗P(ξ) = f ∗
wP(ξ)

and thus α(f ∗P) = f ∗
α(P)

.
3. This follows by observing that the mapping ι
  : P →P[λ] deﬁned by ι
 (p) :=
[(p, 1)], together with the Lie group homomorphism λ, provides a vertical morphism
of principal bundles over M.

Recall that in Sect.4.2 we have constructed characteristic classes in singular coho-
mology for the classical compact Lie groups. We are now going to analyze how
these are related to the characteristic classes in de Rham cohomology provided by
the Weil homomorphism. We start with brieﬂy recalling the relation between de
Rham cohomology and singular cohomology, cf. Sect.4.3 of Part I.
By the de Rham Theorem [104, Sect.V.9], there exists an isomorphism between
the de Rham cohomology ring H∗
dR(M) and the singular cohomology ring with real
coefﬁcients H∗
R(M). This isomorphism is referred to as the de Rham isomorphism. It
isobtainedasfollows.LetC∞
k (M)denotethefreeAbeliangroupgeneratedbysmooth
k-simplices. Together with the ordinary boundary operator, the groups C∞
k (M) form
a chain complex. Recall that Hk
R(M) may be thought of as being the (co)homology
groups of the corresponding cochain complex Hom(C∞
k (M), R). Let δ denote the
coboundary homomorphism. Given a k-form α on M, we may deﬁne a homomor-
phism ˆα : C∞
k (M) →R by assigning to each smooth simplex σ : Δk →M the inte-
gral
ˆα(σ) :=

Δk σ ∗α .
By linearity of pullback and integration, the assignment α 
→ˆα deﬁnes a group
homomorphism Ωk(M) →Hom(C∞
k (M), R). By Stokes' Theorem, one has 
dα =
δ ˆα. It follows that the mapping α 
→ˆα induces a group homomorphism Hk
dR(M) →
Hk
R(M). This homomorphism is the de Rham isomorphism in degree k. One can show
thattheinducedgroupisomorphismH∗
dR(M) →H∗

see [652, Theorem 5.45].

4.6 The Weil Homomorphism
319
Thus, by means of composition with the de Rham isomorphism, we may view the
Weil homomorphism as a mapping
wP : PolG(g) →H∗
R(M) .
We do not distinguish in notation between these viewpoints.
Next, we determine a system of generators of the algebra PolG(g) for the classical
compact Lie groups. For that purpose, we consider a maximal Abelian subalgebra
t ⊂g. We denote the normalizer and the centralizer of t in G by
NG(t) = {a ∈G : Ad(a)t ⊂t} ,
CG(t) = {a ∈G : Ad(a)↾t = idt} ,
respectively, and deﬁne
W := NG(t)/CG(t) .
Since CG(t) is a normal subgroup of NG(t), W is a group. It is called the Weyl group
of g. The adjoint representation induces an action of W on t. Let PolW(t) denote the
algebra of polynomial functions on t which are invariant under the action of W. In
the theory of compact Lie groups13 it is shown that W is ﬁnite and that the mapping
μ : G × t →g ,
μ(a, B) := Ad(a)B ,
(4.6.13)
is a surjective submersion. The latter implies, in particular, that any two maximal
Abelian subalgebras are conjugate to one another under Ad(G). As a consequence,
W does not depend on the choice of t. Another consequence is that every orbit of
the adjoint representation in g intersects t, because, obviously, every element of g
is contained in a maximal Abelian subalgebra. It is furthermore shown that any two
elements of t belong to the same G-orbit in g iff they belong to the same W-orbit
in t. Thus, more precisely, each orbit of the adjoint representation intersects t in a
W-orbit. It follows that restriction to t deﬁnes a homomorphism PolG(g) →PolW(t).
Lemma 4.6.9 The restriction homomorphism PolG(g) →PolW(t) is an isomor-
phism.
Proof To prove injectivity, let p1, p2 ∈PolG(g) be such that p1↾t = p2↾t and let A ∈g.
Since the orbit of A under the adjoint representation intersects t, there exist B ∈t
and a ∈G such that A = Ad(a)B. By Ad-invariance,
pi(A) = pi

Ad(a)B

= pi(B) ,
i = 1, 2 .
Since p1(B) = p2(B), we conclude p1(A) = p2(A) and hence p1 = p2.
13A standard reference is [105]. The arguments for the classical compact Lie groups are elementary
though, see the discussion below.

To prove surjectivity, let q ∈PolW(t) be given. Since for each A ∈g, the orbit
of A under the adjoint representation of G intersects t in a W-orbit, there exists
B ∈t such that A = Ad(a)B for some a ∈G and any two such B are mapped to
one another by an element of W. Since q is W-invariant, we can deﬁne a mapping
p : g →R by p(A) = q(B). By construction, p is invariant. It remains to show that
p is polynomial. We may assume that q is homogeneous of degree k. Then, so is p.
Since (4.6.13) is a surjective submersion and since submersions admit local sections,
for every A ∈g, there exists an open neighbourhood U of A and a smooth mapping
s : U →G × g such that composition of (4.6.13) with s yields idU. Hence, on U, p
coincides with s∗◦pr∗
t(q), where prt : G × t →t denotes the natural projection to
the second factor. This shows that p is smooth. Now, we choose a basis {ea} in g and
consider the corresponding partial derivatives, given by
∂p
∂Aa (A) := d
dt ↾0
p(A + t ea) .
One can check that the functions
∂
∂Aa1 · · ·
∂
∂Aal p
are
homogeneous
of
degree
k −l
for
l ≤k
and
that
they
vanish
for
l > k (Exercise 4.6.4). It follows that p coincides with its k-th order Taylor poly-
nomial centered at the origin. Thus, p is polynomial.
■
Now, we are going to determine PolG(g) for the classical compact Lie groups explic-
itly. We start with the case G = U(n). A maximal Abelian subalgebra tU ⊂u(n) is
given by the subalgebra of diagonal matrices. Since every element of u(n) is skew-
adjoint, it admits an orthonormal eigenbasis. Hence, it is conjugate under the adjoint
representation to an element of tU. Since the spectrum of an element of u(n) is invari-
ant under the adjoint representation, if two elements of tU are conjugate under the
adjoint representation, they have the same eigenvalues and hence they differ by a per-
mutation of entries. In particular, the normalizer NU(n)(tU) acts on tU by permutation
of entries. Since every permutation can be represented in this way, the Weyl group
WU coincides with Sn. Thus, in the present example we see explicitly that the Weyl
group is ﬁnite and that every orbit of the adjoint representation intersects a maximal
Abelian subalgebra in a Weyl group orbit.
Let SymR[x1, . . . , xn] denote the algebra of symmetric polynomials with real
coefﬁcients in the real variables x1, . . . , xn. Since the elements of tU are skew-adjoint,
they have purely imaginary entries. Hence, every p ∈SymR[x1, . . . , xn] deﬁnes a
WU-invariant polynomial function pU on tU by14
14We will see below that the normalization factor 4π will make the cohomology classes obtained
via the Weil homomorphism match the Chern classes. In many textbooks, the factor is 2π. This
will be explained in Remark 4.6.10.

(4.6.14)
and the assignment p 
→pU yields an algebra isomorphism SymR[x1, . . . , xn] ∼=
PolWU(tU). By Lemma 4.6.9, the WU-invariant polynomial functions pU extend to Ad-
invariant polynomial functions on u(n), denoted by the same symbol, and the assign-
mentp 
→pU deﬁnesanisomorphismofalgebrasSymR[x1, . . . , xn] ∼= PolU(n)(u(n)).
Clearly,
p
U(A) = p (λ1, . . . , λn) ,
(4.6.15)
where λj are the eigenvalues of
i
4π A, counted with multiplicity.
Since the algebra SymR[x1, . . . , xn] is generated by the elementary symmetric
polynomials σ0, . . . , σn, the algebra PolU(n)(u(n)) is generated by the corresponding
invariant polynomial functions σ U
0 , . . . , σ U
n deﬁned by (4.6.15). Thus, in order to
control the Weil homomorphism for a given principal U(n)-bundle P over M, it
sufﬁces to know (the cohomology classes of) the forms ˆhΩ(σ U
k ) for the curvature
form Ω of some connection on P. To compute these classes, we recall that the
eigenvalues λj of
i
4π A are the zeros of the characteristic polynomial

Here, Ω ∧· · · ∧Ω denotes the exterior product of gl(n, C)-valued forms induced
by the associative matrix product, cf. Remark 1.4.8/1. We obtain the same formulae
for ˆhΩ(σ U
k ) by viewing the right hand sides as forms on M.
Remark 4.6.10
1. According to (4.6.19), the Weil homomorphism is formally given by plugging in
the matrix elements of iΩ
2π relative to some local frame in Ad(P), viewed as local
2-forms, into the polynomial given and replacing all products by wedge products.
Therefore, it is common to write
σk

≡ˆhΩ(σ

k ) ,
k = 0, . . . , n ,
although the actual scaling factor is 4π and not 2π, because of the factor 2k one
acquires by rewriting products as wedge products, cf. (4.6.8).
2. If for the wedge product of a k-form and an l-form on M one uses the convention
to multiply by a factor
1
(k+l)! instead of
1
k!l!, as is done for example in [383], the
construction of the Weil homomorphism has to be modiﬁed as follows.

4.6 The Weil Homomorphism
323
a. The product of a k-linear form with an l-linear form on g is deﬁned with a
factor
1
(k+l)!.
b. Polarization reads ˆξ(A) = ξ(A, . . . , A).
c. For a polynomial function ξ of order k on g, the form hα(ξ) is deﬁned with a
factor
1
(2k)!.
d. The polynomial function pU on g induced from p ∈SymR[x1, . . . , xn] is
deﬁned by p(λ1, . . . , λn) where λi are the eigenvalues of
i
2π A.
Under these modiﬁcations, the mapping hα is a homomorphism for every 2-form
α and formulae (4.6.19)-(4.6.22) hold true.
♦
Now, we can compare the cohomology classes wP(σ U
k ) with the Chern classes of P.
Theorem 4.6.11 For every principal U(n)-bundle P over M and every k = 0, . . . , n,
there holds wP(σ U
k ) = ck(P) under the de Rham isomorphism.
Proof Clearly, the assertion holds for k = 0, so that we may assume k ≥1. Our proof
is along the lines of [451]. We proceed by showing the following.
1. The assertion holds if it holds for all smooth principal U(1)-bundles.
2. The assertion holds for all smooth principal U(1)-bundles if it holds for the
complex Hopf bundle.
3. The assertion holds for the complex Hopf bundle.
1. Assume that the assertion holds for all principal U(1)-bundles. First, we use
the Splitting Principle to argue that we may restrict attention to bundles P admit-
ting a reduction to U(1)n. Indeed, given an arbitrary P, let ρ : P/U(1)n →M
denote the induced projection. Since wP(σ U
k ) and ck are characteristic classes,
one has wρ∗P(σ U
k ) = ρ∗wP(σ U
k ) and ck(ρ∗P) = ρ∗ck(P). By Theorem 4.3.7, then
wρ∗P(σ U
k ) = ck(ρ∗P) implies wP(σ U
k ) = ck(P) and ρ∗P admits a reduction to U(1)n.
This shows that without loss of generality we may assume that P itself admits a
reduction to U(1)n.
Now, if Q is a reduction of P to U(1)n, then P is vertically isomorphic to
Q[j], where j : U(1)n →U(n) denotes the natural inclusion mapping. By
Corollary 4.6.8/3, then
wP(σ

wQ(pr∗

Since Q[pri] is a principal U(1)-bundle, by assumption,

Q[pri]
under the de Rham isomorphism. Let f : M →BU(1)n be a classifying mapping for

wQ[pri](σ

Since Bj ◦f is a classifying mapping for Q[j] and Q[j] is vertically isomorphic to P,
we ﬁnally obtain the assertion.
2. Let Pn denote the canonical U(1)-bundle over CPn (Stiefel bundle), cf. Remark
1.1.25 and Example 4.2.18. Recall that P1 is the complex Hopf bundle and that Pn is
(n −1)-universal, cf. Theorem 3.4.10. Thus, it sufﬁces to prove that if the assertion
holds for P1, then it holds for Pn for all n. Let Ωn denote the curvature form of the
canonical connection on Pn, cf. Example 1.3.20.
The standard embedding of C2 into Cn+1 induces a morphism of principal U(1)-
bundles F : P1 →Pn covering the standard embedding f : CP1 →CPn. Composi-
tion of f with the mapping
s : D2 →S2 ∼= CP1 ,
s(z) :=

(4.6.24)
yields the 2-cell of the standard cell complex structure of CPn, which is obtained
by successively attaching to CPi = {[(z0, · · · , zi, 0, · · · , 0)] : z ∈S2i+1} ⊂CPn the
2(i + 1)-cell given by the mapping

see for example [104, Example IV.8.9]. Thus, the homology class [f ◦s] represents
a generator of the singular homology group H2(CPn) ∼= Z. Under the identiﬁcation
H2
R(CPn) ∼= Hom(H2(CPn), R) provided by the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem, the
de Rham isomorphism maps the cohomology class wPn(σ U
1 ) to the homomorphism

Here, we have used that s preserves the orientations (Exercise 4.6.6). Thus, what we
have to show is

CP1 f ∗ˆhΩn(σ
U
1 ) = ⟨c1(Pn), [f ◦s]⟩,
(4.6.25)
where c1(Pn) stands for the corresponding homomorphism H2(CPn) →R. By
Lemma 4.6.4/3 and formula (4.6.9), f ∗ˆhΩn(σ U
1 ) = ˆhF∗Ωn(σ U
1 ). Via the vertical iso-
morphism P1 →f ∗Pn provided by F, the form F∗Ωn corresponds to Ω1. Hence, for
the left hand side of (4.6.25), we may write

CP1
ˆhΩ1(σ
U
1 ) .
Since P1 and f ∗Pn are vertically isomorphic, the right hand side of (4.6.25) can be
rewritten as ⟨c1(P1), [s]⟩. Thus, (4.6.25) holds for all n if

CP1
ˆhΩ1(σ
U
1 ) = ⟨c1(P1), [s]⟩,
(4.6.26)
that is, if it holds for n = 1.
3. It remains to prove (4.6.26). By Remark 4.5.4, evaluation of the right hand side
yields
⟨c1(P1), [s]⟩= −1 .
To compute the left hand side of (4.6.26), we identify CP1 with S2 via the diffeo-
morphism of Remark 1.1.21/3 and the bundle manifold of P1 with S3 via the natural
diffeomorphism S3 →SC(2, 1) induced from the embedding S3 →C2. Under these
identiﬁcations, the bundle projection is given by the mapping

Ω1 = dz1 ∧dz1 + dz2 ∧dz2 .

ck(P), viewed via the homomorphism H2k
Z (M) →H2k
R (M) ∼= Hom(H2k(M), R) as a

this is the same as evaluating the homomorphism H2k(M) →Z deﬁned by ck(P) via
the left vertical arrow on [s].

Next, we discuss the groups O(n) and SO(n). We start with O(n). If n = 2l, a maximal
Abelian subalgebra tO is given by the block diagonal matrices with blocks

The Weyl group WO is generated by the permutations of the blocks and by the opera-

and the assignment p 
→pO deﬁnes an isomorphism SymR[x1, . . . , xl] ∼= PolWO(tO).
By analogy with the case of U(n), the WO-invariant polynomial function pO extends
to an Ad-invariant polynomial function on o(n), denoted by the same symbol and
given by
p
O(A) := p (x1, . . . , xl) ,
(4.6.28)
where ix1, −ix1, . . . , ixl, −ixl are the eigenvalues of
1
4π A, counted with multiplici-
ties.15 The assignment p 
→pO deﬁnes an algebra isomorphism SymR[x1, . . . , xl] ∼=
PolO(n)(o(n)). Consequently, PolO(n)(o(n)) is generated by σ O
0 , . . . , σ O
l .
In case n = 2l + 1, the induced homomorphism djO
2l,2l+1 : o(2l) →o(2l + 1)
embeds the maximal Abelian subalgebra tO of o(2l) into o(2l + 1) as a maximal
Abelian subalgebra of o(2l + 1). Moreover, it translates the Weyl group actions into
one another. As a consequence, pullback by djO
2l,2l+1 deﬁnes an algebra isomorphism
PolO(2l+1)o(2l + 1) ∼= PolO(2l)o(2l). Via this isomorphism and the construction for
O(2l),eachp ∈SymR[x1, . . . , xl]deﬁnesanelementpO ofPolO(2l+1)o(2l + 1).Asfor
n = 2l, the assignment p 
→pO deﬁnes an algebra isomorphism SymR[x1, . . . xl] ∼=
PolO(2l+1)o(2l + 1) and thus PolO(2l+1)o(2l + 1) is generated by σ O
0 , . . . , σ O
l .
Now, consider the group SO(n). Since so(n) = o(n), we may use the same maxi-
mal Abelian subalgebra, tO. In case n = 2l + 1, the group O(2l + 1) is generated by
its center and SO(2l + 1). Hence, in this case, there is no difference in the adjoint
actions of O(2l + 1) and SO(2l + 1) and thus there is no difference in the Weyl
groups, WSO = WO. Therefore,
PolSO(2l+1)so(2l + 1) = PolO(2l+1)o(2l + 1) .
In case n = 2l, however, WSO is generated by the permutations of the blocks and by the
operations of simultaneously taking the transpose of two distinct blocks. Therefore,
WSO ⊂WO and hence PolWO(tO) is a subalgebra of PolWSO(tO) and PolO(2l)

k ).
For the assertion about the Euler class in the case where the structure group is
SO(2l), one may give an argument which is essentially analogous to that for the
Chern classes in the proof of Theorem 4.6.11. Let us sketch this.
By Theorem 3.4.10, it sufﬁces to prove the assertion under the assumption that
P is a Stiefel bundle. Thus, take P = SR(2l, m) and M = GR(2l, m) for some m. By
embedding U(l) via j
U,SO
l
into SO(2l), we can form the quotient manifold P/U(l). It
hasthestructureofalocallytrivialﬁbrebundleoverM withtypicalﬁbreSO(2l)/U(l).
Let
f : P/U(l) →M
(4.6.30)
be the induced projection. One can show that the homomorphism induced in coho-
mology with real coefﬁcients, f ∗: H∗
R(M) →H∗
R(P/U(l)), is injective. For example,
according to Theorem 4.2 and Lemma 4.5 in [452], this follows from the fact that the
Serre spectral sequence of the ﬁbre bundle (4.6.30) collapses which, in turn, is due to
the fact that the cohomology with real coefﬁcients of both the base M = GR(2l, m)
and the ﬁbre SO(2l)/U(l) vanish in odd degree, see [90, 621] and [452, Theorem
6.11], respectively. Thus, it sufﬁces to prove the assertion for the principal SO(2l)-
bundle f ∗P over P/U(l). Since this bundle admits a reduction to the subgroup U(l),
we conclude that it sufﬁces to prove the assertion for all principal SO(2l)-bundles
which admit a reduction to the subgroup U(l).
Thus, denote ι = j
U,SO
l
and let P be a principal SO(2l)-bundle such that P = Q[ι]
for some principal U(l)-bundle Q. By Corollary 4.6.8/3,
wP(ε) = wQ

sition 3.7.2/1 and formula (4.4.8), the latter equals e(P).

By analogy with Corollary 4.6.12, from Theorem 4.6.14, we obtain the following.

are given by

■
Finally, let us discuss the case of G = Sp(n). Elements of sp(n) are skew-adjoint
quaternionic matrices of dimension n, where taking the adjoint means taking the
transpose of the matrix and the quaternionic conjugate of every entry. Hence, the
entries of diagonal elements of sp(n) are linear combinations of the quaternionic
units i, j and k. To obtain a maximal Abelian subalgebra tSp we have to stick to one
of these. Let us choose
tSp =
#
diag(x1i, . . . , xni) : x1, . . . , xn ∈R
$
.
The Weyl group WSp is generated by the permutations of the entries and the oper-
ations of taking the quaternionic conjugate of an individual entry, which amounts
to multiplying one of the xi by −1. Hence, every p ∈SymR[x1, . . . , xn] deﬁnes an
element pSp of PolWSptSp by

and the assignment p 
→pSp yields an isomorphism SymR[x1, . . . , xn] ∼= PolWSp(tSp).
By Ad-invariant extension, we obtain an element pSp of PolSp(n)(sp(n)), and the
assignment p 
→pSp deﬁnes an isomorphism SymR[x1, . . . , xn] ∼= PolSp(n)(sp(n)).

tryagin indices pk,i(P) of P relative to a chosen set of generators {si} of H4k(M) are
given by

4.6 The Weil Homomorphism
331
To conclude this section, we carry over the above concepts to vector bundles. The
Weil homomorphism for principal bundles induces a Weil homomorphism for vector
bundles as follows. Given a K-vector bundle E of rank n over M, choose a ﬁbre
metric on E and let O(E) denote the corresponding orthonormal frame bundle. This
is a principal bundle with structure group G = O(n) in case K = R, G = U(n) in
case K = C and G = Sp(n) in case K = H. Thus, we can deﬁne
wE := wO(E) : SymG

g

→H∗
dR(M) .
If K = R and E is orientable, O(E) admits a reduction O+(E) to the subgroup
G = SO(n). In this case, we can deﬁne the oriented Weil homomorphism of E by
˜wE := wO+(E) : SymSO(n)

so(n)

→H∗
dR(M) .
Now, Theorems 4.6.11, 4.6.14 and 4.6.16 imply that under the de Rham isomorphism,
for K = C, R, H, one has
• wE(σ U
k ) = ck(E) for k = 0, . . . , n,
• wE(σ O
k ) = pk(E) for k = 0, . . . , ¯qn,
• wE(σ
Sp
k ) = pk(E) for k = 0, . . . , n.
Moreover, Theorem 4.6.14 implies that in case K = R, if E is orientable and has
even rank n, one has, in addition
˜wE(ε) = e(E) .
(4.6.31)
More generally, a part of the construction of the Weil homomorphism carries over
to vector bundles. This allows for deﬁning genuine characteristic classes of vector
bundles, notably the twisted Chern character of a graded vector bundle and the
relative Chern character of a graded Dirac bundle, to be discussed in Sect.5.8. For
a real vector bundle E, let Pol(E) and Sym(E) denote the algebra bundles whose
ﬁbres over m ∈M are, respectively, the algebra of real polynomial functions on Em
and the algebra generated by the real symmetric multilinear forms on Em. Fibrewise
polarization and multilinearization deﬁne mutually inverse vertical algebra bundle
isomorphisms
ˆ : Sym(E) →Pol(E) and ˇ : Pol(E) →Sym(E) .
(4.6.32)
The spaces of sections in Pol(E) and Sym(E) form real algebras with respect to
pointwise multiplication
(f · g)(m) := f (m) · g(m) ,
where on the right hand side the product is taken in the corresponding ﬁbre over
m, that is, in Pol(Em) and in Sym(Em), respectively. The vertical isomorphisms

Note that the construction directly produces forms on M, so there is no need to project
here.
Lemma 4.6.18
1. The mapping (4.6.33) is a homomorphism of algebras.
2. Let Φ : E1 →E2 be a vertical vector bundle morphism and let α ∈Ω2(M, E1)
and q ∈Pol(E2). Then, Φ ◦α ∈Ω2(E2), q ◦Φ ∈Pol(E1) and
hΦ◦α(q) = hα(q ◦Φ).
Proof Exercise 4.6.7.
■
Generally, the forms hα(f ) need not be closed and hence they need not represent
cohomology classes. Thus, if one wants to construct a characteristic class this way,
one has to ensure closedness separately. Let us discuss a special situation where
closedness is granted. In what follows, for a complex Hermitean vector bundle E, let
u(E) ⊂End(E) denote the vertical subbundle of skew-adjoint endomorphisms. Let
P be a principal bundle over M with compact structure group G and let σ be a unitary
representation of G on a ﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space V . Then, P ×G V
is a complex Hermitean vector bundle over M. We apply the construction of forms
hα(κ) just explained to the real vector bundle E = u(P ×G V ). Recall from Remark
1.2.9/2 that u(P ×G V ) is naturally vertically isomorphic to P ×G u(V ), where G
acts on u(V ) via the induced representation
(a, A) 
→σ(a) ◦A ◦σ(a−1) .
(4.6.34)
The isomorphism is given by
Φ : P ×G u(V ) →u(P ×G V ) ,
Φ([(p, A)]) := ιp ◦A ◦ι−1
p .

Proof Since σ is unitary, the induced representation dσ takes values in u(V ). More-
over, dσ is equivariant with respect to the adjoint representation of G on g and the
representation (4.6.34). Hence, if κ ∈PolG

u(V )

, then (dσ)∗κ ∈PolG(g), so that
hΩ

is well deﬁned. For the proof, we assume that κ is homogeneous of

Rπ(p)(π′X1, π′X2) = Φ

[p, σ ′(Ω)p(X1, X2)]

Sp(n) and let g denote the corresponding Lie algebra. Recall that we have a natural
vertical isomorphism E ∼= O(E) ×G Kn and hence a vertical isomorphism

Corollary 4.6.20 Let E be a K-vector bundle of rank n over M endowed with a
positive deﬁnite ﬁbre metric and let R be the curvature endomorphism form of a
compatible connection ∇. If a section κ in Pol(u(E)) corresponds under the natural
vertical isomorphism (4.6.38) to the section κ′ deﬁned by some κ′ ∈PolG(g), then
hR(κ) is closed and represents wE(κ′).
Proof Denote the vertical isomorphism E →O(E) ×G Kn by Ψ . That κ corresponds
to κ′ under Ψ means
κm(A) = κ′

m ∈M , A ∈

For the curvature endomorphism form R′ of ∇′, this implies
R′(X, Y) = Ψ ◦R(X, Y) ◦Ψ −1 ,
X, Y ∈X(M) .
(4.6.40)
In turn, ∇′ corresponds to a connection on O(E) with curvature form Ω′. By
Lemma4.6.19, we have hR′(κ′) = ˆhΩ′(κ′), hence hR′(κ′) represents wE(κ′). On the
other hand, (4.6.39) and (4.6.40) imply hR′(κ′) = hR(κ).

k corresponds to the section σk

σ U
k on u(n) deﬁned by (4.6.15). Hence, Theorem 4.6.11 and Corollary 4.6.20 imply
that,underthedeRhamisomorphism, ck(E)isrepresentedbytheformhR(σ E
k ),where
R is the curvature endomorphism form of some connection on E compatible with
the ﬁbre metric. Finally, we observe that the computation yielding the trace formulae
(4.6.19)-(4.6.22) for the forms representing the Chern classes of a principal bundle
carries over to hR(σ E
k ). As a result, we obtain the corresponding formulae for ck(E)
with Ω replaced by R.
We leave it to the reader to derive analogous statements for the Pontryagin classes
of real and quaternionic vector bundles and for the Euler class of an oriented real

Example 4.6.22 We derive a trace formula for the ﬁrst Pontryagin class of the
adjoint bundle Ad(P) associated with a given principal bundle P with compact
structure group G over some manifold M. Recall that, by deﬁnition, p1(Ad(P)) =
−c2(Ad(P)C). By choosing a G-invariant scalar product on gC, we can turn the
complexiﬁcation Ad(P)C = P ×G gC into a Hermitean vector bundle. Let Ω be the
curvature of some compatible connection on P and let R ∈Ω2

The discussion in the previous section carries over without change from polynomials
to formal power series. For a vector space V , let FPS(V ) denote the vector space
of formal power series on V . For a vector bundle E, let FPS(E) denote the vector
bundle whose ﬁbre at m ∈M is given by FPS(Em).
Given a principal G-bundle P over M, the Weil homomorphism wP extends to a
homomorphism
wP : FPSG(g) →H∗
dR(M) .
Similarly, given a complex vector bundle E, the Weil homomorphism of E extends
to a homomorphism
wE : FPSU(n)(u(n)) →H∗
dR(M) ,
and a similar statement holds for real and quaternionic vector bundles. More gener-
ally, given α ∈Ω2(M, E), the homomorphism hα deﬁned by (4.6.33) extends to a
homomorphism

This gives rise to genera of vector bundles. Let us explain this in detail for the case
of complex vector bundles. Assume that we are given a formal power series

in one real variable x with real coefﬁcients al and constant term a0 = 1. This series
deﬁnes a symmetric formal power series in n real variables x1, . . . , xn by
q(x1, . . . , xn) := q(x1) · · · q(xn) .
(4.7.1)
Being symmetric, the latter deﬁnes an element qU of FPSU(n)u(n) by (4.6.15). Then,

(4.7.3)
The following argument shows that the polynomials Kk do not depend on the number
of independent variables n. For clarity, let us display this number by writing q(n)
k
and
K(n)
k . For l < n, we have
q(n)
k (x1, . . . , xl, 0, . . . , 0) = q(l)
k (x1, . . . , xl)
and
σi(x1, . . . , xl, 0, . . . , 0) =

σi(x1, . . . , xl) i ≤l ,
0
i > l .
Hence,
q(l)
k (x1, . . . , xl) = q(n)
k (x1, . . . , xl, 0, . . . , 0)
= K(n)
k

σ1(x1, . . . , xl), . . . , σl(x1, . . . , xl), 0, . . . , 0

This shows that K(l)
k
can be obtained from K(n)
k
by setting the last n −l entries to 0.
Thus, if we extend the notation of elementary symmetric polynomials in n variables to
arbitrary order by setting σi(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 for i > n, then K(l)
k
= K(n)
k , as asserted.
Since Kk can depend on σl with l ≤k only, irrespective of the number of independent
variables we thus have qk = Kk(σ1, . . . , σk) and hence

(4.7.6)
According to (4.7.5) and (4.7.6), sometimes, the q-genus for complex vector bundles
is referred to as the Chern q-genus and the q-genus for real or quaternionic vector
bundles is referred to as the Pontryagin q-genus.
Proposition 4.7.1 Let q be a formal power series in one real variable with constant
coefﬁcient 1 and let γ be the corresponding genus for K-vector bundles, K = R, C
or H.
1. The assignment E 
→γ (E) deﬁnes a characteristic class for vector bundles.
2. For K-vector bundles E1, E2 over M, one has γ (E1 ⊕E2) = γ (E1)γ (E2).
3. If E has rank 1, then γ (E) = 1 in the real case, γ (E) = q

c1(E)

in the complex
case and γ (E) = q

p1(E)

in the quaternionic case.
Proof 1. This follows from Corollary 4.6.8/2.
2. First, we show that if a1, . . . , ak and b1, . . . , bk are independent variables, and
if
ck :=

i+j=k
aibj ,
then
Kk(c1, . . . , ck) =

i+j=k
Ki(a1, . . . , ai)Kj(b1, . . . , bj) .
(4.7.7)
By uniqueness of the polynomials Kk, it sufﬁces to check this for ai and bi being
the elementary symmetric polynomials in the independent variables x1, . . . , xk and
y1, . . . , yk, respectively. Clearly, then ci = σi(x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yk) . Hence,
Kk(c1, . . . , ck) = qk(x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yk) .
Since q(x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yk) = q(x1, . . . , xk)q(y1, . . . , yk), we obtain
qk(x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yk) =

i+j=k
qi(x1, . . . , xk) qj(y1, . . . , yk)
=

i+j=k
Ki(a1, . . . , ai)Kj(b1, . . . , bj) .
This proves (4.7.7). Now, we use this to prove the assertion. In the complex case,
we plug in ci(E1) for ai and ci(E2) for bi. Then, Ki(a1, . . . , ai) = γi(E1) and
Kj(b1, . . . , bj) = γj(E2). Moreover, by the Whitney Sum Formula, ck = ck(E1 ⊕E2)
and hence Kk(c1, . . . , ck) = γk(E1 ⊕E2). Thus, (4.7.7) yields the assertion. The
quaternionic case and the real case are analogous, cf. (4.4.20) for the latter.

case. The quaternionic case is analogous. For one variable x, one has σ1(x) = x and
σk(x) = 0 for all k > 1. Hence,
q(x) = 1 + K1(x) + K2(x, 0) + · · · .

Remark 4.7.2
1. In view of the Splitting Principle (Theorem 4.3.7), in the complex and the quater-
nionic case, γ is completely determined by points 2 and 3 of Proposition 4.7.1.

♦
Via the tangent bundle or its complexiﬁcation, the genera for vector bundles deﬁne
genera for manifolds. The latter will play a role in the discussion of the Atiyah-Singer
Index Theorem and its applications in Sects.5.8 and 5.9, as well as in the discussion
of the instanton moduli space in Sect.6.5. In what follows, we derive the properties
needed there.
Let us start with expressing the ˆA-genus of a real vector bundle E of even rank
n = 2l in terms of a determinant. Let q be the Taylor series of the analytic function
(4.7.14). By construction, for A ∈o(2l),

Next, let us discuss the Chern character. The formal series qU, qO and qSp can
be assigned to an arbitrary symmetric formal power series in several variables. For
example, given a formal power series q in one variable, instead of taking the product
(4.7.1) to produce a formal power series in several variables, one may as well take
the sum q(x1) + · · · + q(xn). This way, one may produce, for example, the series
χ(x1, . . . , xn) = ex1 + · · · + exn .
The corresponding Ad-invariant formal power series χ U on u(n) is given by

ch(E) := wE(χ

In low orders, instead of using the general formula (4.7.23), it is easier to read off
Pk directly from (4.7.22). This way one ﬁnds (Exercise 4.7.2), for example, that in

ch(L1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ln) = ec1(L1) + · · · + ec1(Ln) .

where we have used that the ring multiplication in H∗

degree. Plugging this into (4.7.28) and using the lemma once again, we obtain the

The Postnikov Tower and Bundle Classiﬁcation
Recall from Sect.3.4 that, given a Lie group G, principal G-bundles over a manifold
M are classiﬁed up to vertical isomorphisms by homotopy classes of mappings from
M to the classifying space BG. In this section, we explain how to extract information
about principal G-bundles over manifolds of low dimension from an approximation
of BG by means of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. The necessary facts about these
spaces are collected in Appendix G. Let us just state here that for every Abelian group
Aandeverypositiveintegerk,thereexistsaCW-complexhavinghomotopygroupAin
dimension k and trivial homotopy groups in all other dimensions. This CW-complex
is unique up to homotopy equivalence and is referred to as the Eilenberg-MacLane
space K(A, k).
First, we discuss two cases where BG happens to coincide with an Eilenberg-
MacLane space, so that no approximation is needed. The ﬁrst case is that of structure
group U(1).
Theorem 4.8.1 The assignment P →c1(P) induces a bijection from the set of ver-
tical isomorphism classes of principal U(1)-bundles over a manifold M onto the
cohomology group H2
Z(M).
Proof Since the only nontrivial homotopy group of U(1) is π1(U(1)) = Z, from
the exact homotopy sequence of the universal U(1)-bundle bundle we read off that
the only nontrivial homotopy group of BU(1) is π2(BU(1)) = Z. Thus, BU(1) =
K(Z, 2) and (G.1) implies that for every manifold M we have a bijection
[M, BU(1)] →H2
Z(M) ,
f 
→f ∗γ ,

Cohomology Theory of Fibre Bundles. Characteristic Classes
where γ is a characteristic element17 of H2
Z(K(Z, 2)). Since c
U(1)

is a generator and
thus is characteristic, we may choose it for γ . This proves the theorem.
■
Theorem 4.8.1 allows for complementing Corollary 4.2.8 on the orientability of
complex vector bundles.
Corollary 4.8.2 AprincipalU(n)-bundleP admitsareductiontothestructuregroup
SU(n) iff c1(P) = 0. A complex vector bundle E is orientable iff c1(E) = 0.
Proof We give the argument for principal bundles. By Corollary 1.6.5, a reduction
of P to SU(n) exists iff the associated bundle Q := P ×U(n) U(n)/SU(n) is triv-
ial. Combining the embedding j ≡jU
1,n : U(1) →U(n) with the natural projection
to classes p : U(n) →U(n)/SU(n), we obtain an isomorphism ϕ = p ◦j : U(1) →
U(n)/SU(n), which we use to view Q as a U(1)-bundle. Then, by Theorem 4.8.1, Q
is trivial iff c1(Q) = 0.
It remains to show that c1(Q) = c1(P). If f : M →BU(n) is a classifying mapping
for P, then B(ϕ−1 ◦p) ◦f is a classifying mapping for Q. Thus,
c1(Q) = f ∗◦B(ϕ−1 ◦p)∗c
U(1)
1
.
(4.8.1)
Since ϕ−1 ◦p ◦j = idU(1), we have (Bj)∗◦(B(ϕ−1 ◦p))∗c
U(1)
1
= c
U(1)
1
and hence, by
Theorem 4.2.1, (B(ϕ−1 ◦p))∗c
U(1)
1
= c
U(n)
1 . Thus, (4.8.1) yields c1(Q) = c1(P), as
asserted.
■
The second case where BG is an Eilenberg-MacLane space is that of structure
group Zg, where g = 2, 3, . . . . According to Example 3.4.17/2, the action of Zg as
a subgroup of U(1) on S∞turns S∞into the universal principal Zg-bundle over L∞
g ,
the inﬁnite lens space of order g. Thus, L∞
g may be taken as the classifying space
BZg. On the other hand, since S∞is weakly contractible and the only nontrivial
homotopy group of Zg is π0(Zg) = Zg, from the exact homotopy sequence of the
bundle S∞→L∞
g we read off that L∞
g is a model of the Eilenberg-MacLane space
K(Zg, 1). Accordingly, H1
Zg(L∞
g ) is generated by a single element δg and this element
is characteristic. We will denote the corresponding Zg-valued characteristic class for
principal Zg-bundles by the same symbol. A similar argument as in the proof of
Theorem 4.8.1 yields the following.
Theorem 4.8.3 The assignment P →δg(P) induces a bijection from the vertical
isomorphism classes of principal Zg-bundles over a manifold M onto H1
Zg(M).
■
In case g = 2, we have Z2 = O(1) and δ2 is just the Stiefel-Whitney class w
O(1)
1 .
Thus, by analogy with Corollary 4.8.2, Theorem 4.8.3 allows for complementing
Corollary 4.2.17 on orientability of real vector bundles (Exercise 4.8.1).
Corollary 4.8.4 A principal O(n)-bundle P admits a reduction to SO(n) iff
w1(P) = 0. A real vector bundle E is orientable iff w1(E) = 0.

As a consequence, every simply connected manifold is orientable.
Now, we turn to the general situation where BG is not just an Eilenberg-MacLane
space, so that an approximation makes sense. In our presentation, we follow [287].
Recall that a continuous mapping f : X →Y of topological spaces is called an n-
equivalence if the induced homomorphism f∗: πk(X) →πk(Y) is an isomorphism
for k < n and a surjection for k = n. An ∞-equivalence is the same as a weak
homotopy equivalence.
Theorem 4.8.5 (Postnikov tower) Let Y be a pathwise connected CW-complex. For
n = 1, 2, . . . , there exist CW-complexes Yn and continuous mappings yn : Y →Yn
and qn : Yn+1 →Yn such that, for every n,
1. yn is an n-equivalence,
2. qn ◦yn+1 = yn,
3. Y1 is contractible and πk(Yn) = 0 for k ≥n.
The assertion can be summarized by saying that one has an inﬁnite commutative
diagram as shown in Fig.4.1, with the spaces Yn being CW-complexes having prop-
erty 3.
Proof Let n be given. Since Y is a CW-complex, πn(Y) is ﬁnitely generated. Hence,
there exists a ﬁnite number of mappings
fi : (Sn, e1) →(Y, y0)
whose homotopy classes generate πn(Y). We use these mappings as attaching map-
pings for (n + 1)-cells to construct from Y a CW-complex X1. Consider the natural
inclusion mapping j : Y →X1. Being cellular, by the Cellular Approximation Theo-
rem,18 theinducedhomomorphismj∗: πk(Y) →πk(X1)dependsontherestrictionof
j to the (k + 1)-skeletons Y (k+1) →X(k+1)
1
only. For k < n, we have Y (k+1) = X(k+1)
1
and hence j∗is an isomorphism here. For k = n, by the Cellular Approximation The-
orem, up to homotopy, every mapping f : Sn →X1 may be chosen to take values in
18Every continuous mapping between CW-complexes is homotopic to a cellular mapping [287,
Theorem 4.8].

= Y (n), which implies that j∗is surjective here. Thus, j is an n-equivalence. In
particular, πn(X1) is generated by the homotopy classes of the mappings j ◦fi. Since
through the cells attached, the latter are homotopic to the constant mapping at y0,
we have πn(X1) = 0. Now, we repeat the procedure with Y replaced by X1 and n
replaced by n + 1 to embed X1 via an (n + 1)-equivalence into a CW-complex X2
with πn+1(X2) = 0. Iterating this, we ﬁnally obtain a CW-complex Yn which con-
tains Y as a subcomplex such that the natural inclusion mapping yn : Y →Yn is an
n-equivalence and πk(Y) = 0 for all k ≥n.
To see that Y1 is contractible, we observe that due to πk(Y1) = 0 for all k, the con-
stant mapping Y1 →∗is a weak homotopy equivalence. Since Y1 is a CW-complex,
the Whitehead Theorem [598] yields that this mapping is in fact a homotopy equiv-
alence. Hence, Y1 is contractible, indeed.
It remains to construct the mappings qn. Since yn+1 is the natural inclusion
mapping of the subcomplex Y of Yn+1, the mapping qn must be the extension of
yn : Y →Yn to the ambient complex Yn+1. Since Yn+1\Y consists of cells of dimen-
sion n + 2 and larger, whereas πk(Yn) = 0 for all k ≥n, such an extension exists and
can be chosen to be cellular (Exercise 4.8.2).
■
Remark 4.8.6 From the construction in the proof we read off that the CW-complexes
Yn can be chosen so that Y (k)
n
= Y (k) for all k ≤n.
♦
While the cellular construction of the spaces Yn is elementary, it requires concrete
knowledge of the cell structure of Y and is therefore hardly manageable in the case
where Y is a classifying space of a Lie group. On the other hand, in order to use
the Postnikov tower for bundle classiﬁcation, there is no need to know the spaces Yn
and the mappings qn in detail. If one replaces the spaces Yn by homotopy equivalent
spaces and redeﬁnes the mappings yn and qn appropriately, then yn is still an n-
equivalence and the relations qn ◦yn+1 = yn continue to hold up to homotopy. Thus,
it is sufﬁcient to know the homotopy types of the spaces Yn. The following theorem
provides information on that.
Recall that a CW-complex Y is said to be simple if it is pathwise connected and
if the natural action19 of π1(Y) on πk(Y) is trivial for all k.
Theorem 4.8.7 (Postnikov tower for simple CW-complexes) Let Y be a simple CW-
complex. For n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , the CW-complex Yn+1 provided by Theorem 4.8.5 is
weakly homotopy equivalent to the total space of the pullback of the path-loop ﬁbra-
tion over the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(πn(Y), n + 1) under some continuous
mapping θn : Yn →K(πn(Y), n + 1).
Let us add that according to the exact homotopy sequence of the path-loop ﬁbration
over K(πn(Y), n + 1), the homotopy ﬁbre of this ﬁbration is a K(πn(Y), n). More-
over, since the homotopy type of the total space of a pullback ﬁbration depends on the
homotopy class of the mapping only [287, Proposition 4.62], it sufﬁces to determine
the homotopy classes of the mappings θn.

4.8 The Postnikov Tower and Bundle Classiﬁcation
349
Proof By passing to the mapping cylinder20 of qn, which is homotopy equivalent
to Yn, we may assume that Yn+1 is a subcomplex of Yn and that qn is the natural
inclusion mapping.
First, we prove that
πk(Yn, Yn+1) =

πn(Y) k = n + 1 ,
0
k ̸= n + 1 .
(4.8.2)
Consider the exact homotopy sequence (3.2.4) of the pair (Yn, Yn+1),
· · · −→πk(Yn+1)
qn∗
−→πk(Yn) −→πk(Yn, Yn+1)
∂−→πk−1(Yn+1)
qn∗
−→πk−1(Yn) −→· · ·
with the connecting homomorphism ∂. By Remark 4.8.6, for k < n, we have
Y (k+1)
n
= Y (k+1) = Y (k+1)
n+1 . Hence, in this case, the Cellular Approximation Theo-
rem yields that both qn∗in this sequence are isomorphisms. By exactness, then
πk(Yn, Yn+1) = 0. For k = n, the right qn∗is still an isomorphism, but now πk(Yn) =
0. Hence, still, πn(Xn, Xn+1) = 0. For k ≥n + 1, we have πk(Yn) = πk−1(Yn) = 0
and thus ∂is an isomorphism here. Putting k = n + 1, we obtain πn+1(Yn, Yn+1) =
πn(Yn+1) = πn(Y) , because yn+1 is an (n + 1)-equivalence. For all higher k, we
obtain πk(Yn, Yn+1) = πk−1(Yn+1) = 0. This proves (4.8.2).
Next, we show that
πk(Yn/Yn+1) =

πn(Y) k = n + 1 ,
0
k ≤n .
(4.8.3)
That πk(Yn/Yn+1) is trivial for all k ≤n follows from the fact that due to Y (n)
n
=
Y (n) = Y (n)
n+1, the quotient space Yn/Yn+1 consists of cells of dimension n + 1 and
higher only. As a consequence, the absolute Hurewicz Theorem yields
πn+1(Yn/Yn+1) ∼= Hn+1(Yn/Yn+1) .
On the other hand, ∂is equivariant with respect to the actions of π1(Yn+1) on
πn+1(Yn, Yn+1) and πn(Yn+1). Since yn+1 is an n-equivalence, π1(Yn+1) = π1(Y) and
πn(Yn+1) = πn(Y). It follows that simplicity of Y implies that the action of π1(Yn+1)
on πn+1(Yn, Yn+1) is trivial. Hence, in view of (4.8.2), the relative Hurewicz The-
orem21 yields πn+1(Yn, Yn+1) ∼= Hn+1(Yn, Yn+1) and thus Hn+1(Yn, Yn+1) ∼= πn(Y).
Since Hn+1(Yn/Yn+1) ∼= Hn+1(Yn, Yn+1), this proves (4.8.3).
Now, by the procedure of attaching cells used in the proof of Theorem 4.8.5 to
construct Yn from Y, we can construct a CW-complex Kn from Yn/Yn+1 which has
trivial homotopy groups in dimension n + 2 and larger and is thus a model of the
20The mapping cylinder of f : X →Y is the quotient space of (X × I) ⊔Y obtained by identifying
each pair (x, 1) ∈X × I with the point f (x) ∈Y.

Eilenberg-MacLane space K(πn(Y), n + 1). As a base point, we choose the point
k0 ∈Yn/Yn+1 ⊂Kn to which Yn+1 is contracted. Deﬁne
θn : Yn →Yn/Yn+1 →Kn ,
where the ﬁrst mapping is the natural projection to classes and the second mapping is
the natural inclusion mapping. Our next aim is to show that Yn+1 is weakly homotopy
equivalent to the homotopy ﬁbre of θn.
According to Proposition 3.2.16, θn decomposes as
θn : Yn
j−→E
p−→Kn ,
where j is a homotopy equivalence and p is a ﬁbration. Since, by construction,
θn ◦qn sends Yn+1 to k0, the composition j ◦qn sends Yn+1 to the ﬁbre F = p−1(k0).
The exact homotopy sequences of the pairs (E, F) and (Yn, Yn+1) combine to the
following commutative diagram with exact rows and with the vertical arrows given
by inclusion:
πk+1(Yn)


πk+1(Yn, Yn+1)


πk(Yn+1)


πk(Yn)


πk(Yn, Yn+1)

πk+1(E)
 πk+1(E, F)
 πk(F)
 πk(E)
 πk(E, F)
Since Yn is a strong deformation retract of E, the ﬁrst and the fourth vertical arrow
are isomorphisms for all k. By Lemma 3.2.7, πk(E, F) = πk(Kn). Comparing this
with (4.8.2), we ﬁnd that the second and the ﬁfth vertical arrow are isomorphisms
for all k, too. Now, the Five Lemma22 implies that the central vertical arrow is an
isomorphism for all k. This proves that Yn+1 is weakly homotopy equivalent to F,
indeed.
Finally, we prove that F is homeomorphic to the total space of the pullback
ﬁbration θ∗
n PKn. We have
θ∗
n PKn = {(y, γ ) ∈Yn+1 × C(I, Kn) : γ (0) = k0, γ (1) = θn(y)} ,
where C(I, Kn) carries the compact-open topology. On the other hand, from the proof
of Proposition 3.2.16 we read off
F = {(y, γ ) ∈Yn+1 × C(I, Kn) : γ (0) = θn(y), γ (1) = k0} .
Thus, the assignment (y, γ ) 
→(y, γ −1) yields a bijection between θ∗
n PKn and F.
Since the mapping γ 
→γ −1 is continuous relative to the compact-open topology,
this bijection is a homeomorphism. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.8.7.
■
22If the diagram is commutative, if the rows are exact and if the vertical arrows except for that in
the middle are isomorphisms, then the arrow in the middle is an isomorphism, too.

4.8 The Postnikov Tower and Bundle Classiﬁcation
351
As anapplication, weuseTheorems 4.8.5and4.8.7toclassifyprincipal U(n)-bundles
over manifolds of dimension dim M ≤4. This argument belongs to Avis and Isham
[43].
Denote Y = BU(n). Since π1(BU(n)) = π0(U(n)) = 0, the space Y is trivially
simple and the assumption of Theorem 4.8.7 is fulﬁlled. We use the option to replace
the spaces Yn provided by Theorem 4.8.5 by homotopy equivalent spaces, cf. the
discussion prior to Theorem 4.8.7.
At stage 1, Y1 is contractible and may thus be replaced by Y1 = ∗.
At stage 2, Y2 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the total space of the pullback of
the path loop ﬁbration over K(π1(Y), 2) under a mapping θ1 : Y1 →K(π1(Y), 2).
Since Y1 = ∗, Y2 coincides with the corresponding homotopy ﬁbre, which is a
K(π1(Y), 1). Since π1(Y) = 0, we obtain that Y2 is weakly homotopy equivalent
to ∗. Being a CW-complex, it is then homotopy equivalent to ∗and may thus be
replaced by Y2 = ∗.
At stage 3, Y3 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the total space of the pullback of
the path loop ﬁbration over K(π2(Y), 3) under a mapping θ2 : Y2 →K(π2(Y), 3).
Since Y2 = ∗and π2(Y) = π1(U(n)) = Z, we obtain that Y3 is weakly homotopy
equivalent to K(Z, 2). Thinking of K(Z, 2) as being realized by a CW-complex,
it follows that Y3 is homotopy equivalent to K(Z, 2) and thus may be replaced by
Y3 = K(Z, 2).
At stage 4, Y4 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the total space of the pullback of
the path loop ﬁbration over K(π3(Y), 4) under a mapping θ3 : Y3 →K(π3(Y), 4).
Since π3(Y) = π2(U(n)) = 0, we have K(π3(Y), 4) = ∗. Thus, Y4 is weakly homo-
topy equivalent to Y3 and may thus be replaced by Y4 = Y3 = K(Z, 2).
At stage 5, Y5 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the total space of the pullback of
the path loop ﬁbration over K(π4(Y), 5) under a mapping θ4 : Y4 →K(π4(Y), 5).
Since π4(Y) = π3(U(n)) = Z and Y4 = Y3 = K(Z, 2), we have θ4 : K(Z, 2) →
K(Z, 5). Thus, we have to determine

K(Z, 2), K(Z, 5)

. According to (G.1), we
have a bijection

K(Z, 2), K(Z, 5)

= H5
Z(K(Z, 2)) .
According to Appendix G, K(Z, 2) may be realized as CP∞and thus has trivial
cohomology groups in odd dimension. It follows that θ4 is homotopic to a constant
mapping and thus Y5 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the direct product of K(Z, 2)
with the homotopy ﬁbre, which is a K(Z, 4). Thus, realizing K(Z, 4) as a CW-
complex, we ﬁnally may replace
Y5 = K(Z, 2) × K(Z, 4) .
(4.8.4)
Let us use this to classify principal U(n)-bundles over a manifold M of dimen-
sion 4 or less. By the very deﬁnition of the classifying space BU(n), vertical
isomorphism classes of such bundles are in bijective correspondence with homo-
topy classes [M, BU(n)]. Composition with the 5-equivalence y5 yields a bijection
[M, BU(n)] →[M, Y5]. Using in addition (4.8.4), Corollary 3.1.3 and, once again,
(G.1), we obtain a bijection

generator of H2
Z(BU(n)) and (pr2 ◦y5)∗γ4 is a generator of H4
Z(BU(n)). By possibly
redeﬁning γ2 and γ4, we can achieve that (pr1 ◦y5)∗γ2 = c

This translates into the following classiﬁcation result.
Theorem 4.8.8 For a manifold M of dimension ≤4, the assignment

induces a bijection from the set of vertical isomorphism classes of principal U(n)-
bundles over M onto the direct product H2

Z(M).
■
As an immediate consequence, the assignment P 
→c2(P) induces a bijection from
the set of vertical isomorphism classes of principal SU(n)-bundles over M onto
H4
Z(M). Clearly, Theorem 4.8.8 carries over to complex vector bundles over M.
In Sect.8.6, we will present another application of the approximation method
described here.

extension.

Chapter 5
Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures
and Dirac Operators
In this chapter we study the theory of Dirac operators in a systematic way. In
Sects.5.1-5.3, we present the algebraic basics: we discuss the theory of Clifford
algebras and spinor groups, together with their representations. Next, in Sect.5.4,
we study spin- and Spinc-structures on Riemannian manifolds including a num-
ber of relevant examples. The basic geometric structure of this chapter is that of a
Dirac bundle, that is, a Riemannian (or Hermitean) Clifford module bundle over a
(pseudo-)Riemannian manifold endowed with a Clifford connection. Associated with
a Dirac bundle, one has a natural ﬁrst order differential operator acting on sections of
that bundle, called the Dirac operator. In Sect.5.5, all these structures are discussed
in a systematic way. In Dirac operator theory, one of the basic technical ingredi-
ents are Weitzenboeck type formulae. These will be derived in Sect.5.6. Next, in
Sect.5.7, we give a short introduction to the theory of elliptic differential operators
in the context of Sobolev spaces. We prove that the Dirac operator and its square
are elliptic and Fredholm and we give a proof of the Hodge Decomposition Theo-
rem. Finally, we discuss the classical elliptic complexes. Section5.8 is devoted to
the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem. We give a complete proof of this theorem via
the heat kernel method using Getzler rescaling. We also discuss the generalization
of this theorem to families of Dirac operators in some detail, but we do not give a
proof for that case. Finally, in Sect.5.9, we outline how the index theorems for the
classical elliptic complexes follow from the general Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem.
For the Gauß-Bonnet Theorem we give a full proof.

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
5.1
Clifford Algebras
Let us consider a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space1 V over a commutative ﬁeld K of
characteristic zero endowed with a quadratic form q. The pair (V, q) will be called
a quadratic space. Let
T (V) :=
∞

k=0

k

V

be the tensor algebra over V and let Iq(V) be the two-sided ideal in T (V) generated
by elements of the form {v ⊗v −q(v)1} where v ∈V.
Deﬁnition 5.1.1 The Clifford algebra Cl(V, q) of the quadratic space (V, q) is the
quotient algebra deﬁned by
Cl(V, q) := T (V)/Iq(V) .
(5.1.1)
By this deﬁnition, the canonical projection ρ : T (V) →Cl(V, q) is an algebra
homomorphism endowing Cl(V, q) with the structure of an associative algebra with
unit. First, note that the inclusion K →T (V) obviously descends to an inclusion
K →Cl(V, q). Next, since the elements of V generate T (V) multiplicatively, they
also generate Cl(V, q). Moreover, there is a natural linear mapping j : V →Cl(V, q)
given by the restriction of ρ to the vector subspace V ⊂T (V). By construction, j is
injective and fulﬁls
j(v)2 = q(v)1 ,
v ∈V .
(5.1.2)
Therefore, we may view V as a linear subspace of Cl(V, q).2 By (5.1.2), Cl(V, 0)
coincides as an algebra with the exterior algebra ∗V. Since the characteristic of K
is by assumption different from 2,
j(u) · j(v) + j(v) · j(u) = 2η(u, v) ,
u, v ∈V ,
(5.1.3)
where 2η(u, v) = q(u + v) −q(u) −q(v) is the unique symmetric bilinear form
obtained by polarizing q.
The Clifford algebra has the following universal property.
Proposition 5.1.2 (Universal property) Let F : V →A be a linear mapping into a
unital associative K-algebra fulﬁlling
F(v)2 = q(v)1 ,
v ∈V .
(5.1.4)
1Most of the statements of this section hold for inﬁnite-dimensional V as well, see e.g. [407].
2If there will be no danger of confusion, we will sometimes omit the symbol j.

5.1 Clifford Algebras
355
Then, F extends to a unique K-algebra homomorphism ˆF : Cl(V, q) →A fulﬁlling
F = ˆF ◦j.
By analogy, in case K = C, every anti-linear mapping extends uniquely to an anti-
homomorphism.
Proof Every linear mapping F : V →A extends to a unique algebra homomorphism
˜F : T (V) →A and, by (5.1.4), ˜F vanishes identically on Iq(V). Thus, ˜F descends
to a homomorphism ˆF : Cl(V, q) →A fulﬁlling
ˆF ◦j(v) = ˆF ◦ρ(v) = ˜F(v) = F(v) ,
v ∈V .
This property implies the uniqueness of ˆF, because it uniquely determines ˆF on the
set j(V) generating Cl(V, q).
■
Corollary 5.1.3 For a quadratic space (V, q), the Clifford algebra Cl(V, q) is
unique up to an isomorphism. That is, any unital associative K-algebra B such
that
(a) there exists a linear mapping i : V →B,
(b) for a unital associative K-algebra A, any linear mapping F : V →A fulﬁlling
(5.1.4) extends to a unique algebra homomorphism ˆF : B →A fulﬁlling F =
ˆF ◦i,
is isomorphic to Cl(V, q).
Proof For simplicity, let us denote C = Cl(V, q). Putting A = C and F = j, we
conclude that j extends to a unique homomorphism ˆj : B →C fulﬁlling j = ˆj ◦i.
By the same arguments, i extends to a unique homomorphism ˆi : C →B fulﬁlling
i = ˆi ◦j. Thus, we obtain
i = (ˆi ◦ˆj) ◦i ,
j = (ˆj ◦ˆi) ◦j ,
that is, the restrictions of ˆi ◦ˆj : B →B and ˆj ◦ˆi : C →C to i(V) and j(V),
respectively, coincide with the restrictions of the identical mappings idB and idC.
Thus, again by the uniqueness property of extensions, ˆi ◦ˆj = idB and ˆj ◦ˆi = idC
showing that ˆj : B →C is an algebra isomorphism.
■
We note that the properties (a) and (b) in Corollary 5.1.3 may be taken as an axiomatic
deﬁnition of the Clifford algebra. Each of the subsequent propositions of this section
is a consequence of the universal property.
Proposition 5.1.4 (Parity automorphism) Every Clifford algebra Cl(V, q) admits a
unique involutive automorphism induced from the linear mapping
F : V →Cl(V, q) ,
F(v) := −j(v) .

356
5
Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Proof By deﬁnition of F, for every v ∈V, we have F(v)2 = (−j(v))2 = q(v) · 1.
Thus, there exists a unique algebra homomorphism p : Cl(V, q) →Cl(V, q) such
that p ◦j(v) = −j(v). Since, for any v ∈V,
p ◦p ◦j(v) = −p ◦j(v) = j(v) ,
p2 is the identity on the generating set j(V) and, therefore, on the whole of Cl(V, q).
In particular, p is bijective.
■
The element p ∈Aut(Cl(V, q)) will be called the parity automorphism of Cl(V, q).
Given an algebra A, by deﬁnition, the opposite algebra AT is the unique algebra
which coincides with A as a vector space and whose multiplication ∗is induced from
the multiplication · of A by reversing the order. Thus, the identical mapping yields
an isomorphism of algebras ϕ : A →AT fulﬁlling
ϕ(a · b) = ϕ(a) ∗ϕ(b) = b · a .
Proposition 5.1.5 (Canonical anti-automorphism) Any Clifford algebra Cl(V, q)
admits a unique involutive anti-automorphism induced from the linear mapping
F : V →Cl(V, q)T ,
F(v) := ϕ ◦j(v) .
Proof Let ∗be the multiplication in Cl(V, q)T. Since, for every v ∈V,
F(v) ∗F(v) = ϕ(j(v)) ∗ϕ(j(v)) = j(v) · j(v) = q(v) · 1 ,
thereexistsanalgebrahomomorphism ˆF : Cl(V, q) →Cl(V, q)T fulﬁlling ˆF◦j = F.
Then,
t := ϕ−1 ◦ˆF : Cl(V, q) →Cl(V, q)
fulﬁls t ◦j = j and, thus, it is an involution. Moreover, for any a, b ∈Cl(V, q),
t(a · b) = ϕ−1 ◦ˆF(a · b) = ϕ−1( ˆF(a) ∗ˆF(b)) = (ϕ−1 ◦ˆF(b)) · (ϕ−1 ◦ˆF(a)) ,
that is, t(a · b) = t(b) · t(a) showing that t is an anti-automorphism.
■
The mapping t will be called the canonical anti-automorphism. Occasionally, we will
write t(a) ≡aT.
Remark 5.1.6
1. The parity automorphism p induces a Z2-grading of Cl(V, q). Indeed, since p2 =
id, we may decompose the Clifford algebra into an even and an odd part:
Cl(V, q) = Cl0(V, q) ⊕Cl1(V, q) ,
(5.1.5)

5.1 Clifford Algebras
357
where Clk(V, q) =

a ∈Cl(V, q) : p(a) = (−1)ka

, k = 0, 1 , are the eigen-
spaces of p corresponding to the eigenvalues ±1. Clearly,
Clk(V, q) · Cll(V, q) ⊂Clk+l(V, q) ,
where the indices are taken modulo 2. In particular, Cl0(V, q) is a subalgebra.
2. The canonical anti-automorphism t is obtained more directly as follows. The
tensor algebra carries a unique involutive anti-automorphism given by v1⊗. . .⊗vr
→vr ⊗. . . ⊗v1. Note that this mapping coincides with the identity on V ⊂
T (V) and that it leaves the ideal Iq(V) invariant. Thus, it descends to an anti-
automorphism of Cl(V, q) which coincides with t on j(V) and, thus, on the whole
of Cl(V, q).
3. Clearly, p ◦t = t ◦p.
♦
Proposition 5.1.7 The Clifford algebra of the direct sum (V1 ⊕V2, q1 ⊕q2) of
two quadratic spaces (V1, q1) and (V2, q2) is isomorphic to the Z2-graded tensor
product3 of their Clifford algebras,
Cl(V1 ⊕V2, q1 ⊕q2) ∼= Cl(V1, q1) ˆ⊗Cl(V2, q2) .
Proof Consider the linear mapping
F : V1 ⊕V2 →Cl(V1, q1) ˆ⊗Cl(V2, q2) ,
F(v1, v2) := j1(v1) ⊗1 + 1 ⊗j2(v2) .
Then, omitting the symbols j1 and j2, we calculate
(F(v1, v2))2 = (v1 ⊗1 + 1 ⊗v2)2 = v2
1 ⊗1 + 1 ⊗v2
2 = (q1(v1) + q2(v2)) · (1 ⊗1) .
That is, (F(v1, v2))2 = (q1 ⊕q2)(v1, v2) · 1 and, thus, there exists a unique algebra
homomorphism ˆF : Cl(V1 ⊕V2, q1 ⊕q2) →Cl(V1, q1) ˆ⊗Cl(V2, q2). Clearly, ˆF
is surjective, because its image is a subalgebra containing Cl(V1, q1) ⊗1 and 1 ⊗
Cl(V2, q2). It is also injective, because it is one-to-one on elements of V1 ⊕V2
generating Cl(V1 ⊕V2, q1 ⊕q2).
■
This proposition implies the following.
Corollary 5.1.8 Let (V, q) be an n-dimensional quadratic K-vector space. Then,
the vector space Cl(V, q) has dimension 2n.
3Let A and B be two Z2-graded unital K-algebras with decompositions A = A0 ⊕A1 and B =

(Aˆ⊗B)0 := (A0 ⊗B0) ⊕(A1 ⊗B1) , (Aˆ⊗B)1 := (A1 ⊗B0) ⊕(A0 ⊗B1) ,
and whose multiplication law reads as follows:
(a ⊗bj) · (ai ⊗b) := (−1)ij(a · ai) ⊗(b · bj) ,
a ∈A, b ∈B, ai ∈Ai , bj ∈Bj .

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Proof By a classical Theorem of Lagrange, every ﬁnite-dimensional bilinear form
can be diagonalized. Thus, the quadratic form q may be viewed as the sum of n
one-dimensional quadratic forms, q = q1 ⊕. . . ⊕qn. Clearly, the tensor algebra of a
1-dimensional vector space W coincides with the polynomial ring generated by one
element, T (W) = K[a]. Thus, the Clifford algebras of the 1-dimensional quadratic
forms qi on K are given by
Cl(Vi, qi) ∼= K[a]/

a2 −qi(v)1

,
j(v) = a ,
that is, they are 2-dimensional. Now, Proposition 5.1.7 implies the assertion.
■
Remark 5.1.9 (Basis of a Clifford algebra) Let (V, q) be an n-dimensional quadratic
space. Since V ⊂Cl(V, q) generates Cl(V, q) multiplicatively, any basis e1, . . . , en
of V generates Cl(V, q) multiplicatively as well. Viewed as elements4 of the Clifford
algebra, the elements ei are subject to the following relations:
ei · ej + ej · ei = 2η(ei, ej) .
(5.1.6)
Here, η is the bilinear form of q, cf. formula (5.1.3). Thus, the 2n elements
1, ei1 · . . . · eik ,
1 ≤i1 < . . . < ik ≤n , 1 ≤k ≤n ,
span Cl(V, q) and, by Corollary 5.1.8, they form a vector space basis. In conclusion,
the relation (5.1.6) is deﬁning for Cl(V, q).
♦
Given a q-orthogonal basis e1, . . . , en of V, by the above remark, the mapping
1 →1 ,
ei1 · . . . · eik →ei1 ∧· · · ∧eik
(5.1.7)
yields a vector space isomorphism Cl(V, q) ∼=
V, where V denotes the exterior
algebra over V. We show that this isomorphism does not depend on the choice
of a basis. For that purpose, recall from Remark 2.7.9 the contraction mapping
ι : V ∗→End(V) and the operation of exterior multiplication ε.
Proposition 5.1.10 As vector spaces, the Clifford algebra Cl(V, q) and the exterior
algebra V are canonically isomorphic.
Proof Consider the mapping
F : V →End(V) ,
F(v)α := v ∧α + η(v)⌟α ,
(5.1.8)
where η is viewed as a mapping η : V →V ∗. One easily shows (Exercise 5.1.1):
F(v)2α = q(v)α ,
α ∈V .
(5.1.9)
4We omit the mapping j.

5.1 Clifford Algebras
359
Thus, the universal property implies the existence of an algebra homomorphism
ˆF : Cl(V, q) →End(V) which, composed with the evaluation mapping at the
identity 1∧of V, yields a linear mapping
σ : Cl(V, q) →V ,
σ(a) := ˆF(a)

1∧

.
(5.1.10)
It is easy to check (Exercise 5.1.1) that for a chosen orthogonal basis e1, . . . , en of
V, this mapping coincides with the mapping (5.1.7). Thus, σ is an isomorphism of
vector spaces.
■
Remark 5.1.11
1. The isomorphism σ will be called the symbol mapping. Via σ, the parity auto-
morphism p and the canonical anti-automorphism t are transported to V in an
obvious way. The inverse c : V →Cl(V, q) of σ will be referred to as the
quantization mapping. By (5.1.7), for a chosen q-orthogonal basis e1, . . . , en of
V, it is given by c(1) = 1 and
c(ei1 ∧· · ·∧eik) = ei1 ·. . .·eik ,
1 ≤i1 < . . . < ik ≤n , 1 ≤k ≤n . (5.1.11)
In particular, we see that the Z-grading of V deﬁned by the form degree cor-
responds to the vector space Z-grading of Cl(V, q) inherited from the tensor
algebra.
2. The Clifford algebra has a natural increasing ﬁltration Cl(V, q) = 	
i Cli(V, q)
deﬁned by
Cli(V, q) =
i

k=0
c(kV) ,
see [72] and [407] for further details.
3. For q = 0, c and σ are algebra isomorphisms.
♦
In the remainder of this section, we study the special case of the real vector space
V = Rr+s, endowed with the pseudo-Euclidean quadratic form
q(x) = x2
1 + . . . + x2
r −x2
r+1 −. . . −x2
r+s ,
(5.1.12)
where x = (x1, . . . , xr+s) in the standard basis of Rr+s. In the sequel, this quadratic
space will be also denoted by Rr,s. For the corresponding Clifford algebra, we write
Clr,s and we call it the pseudo-orthogonal Clifford algebra of type (r, s). In particular,
we put Cln := Cln,0 and Cl∗
n := Cl0,n.
Remark 5.1.12 By Remark 5.1.9, Clr,s is multiplicatively generated by any q-
orthonormal basis e1, . . . , er+s of Rr+s under the relations

♦
Let K(n) denote the algebra of n×n-matrices with entries in K. This is a real algebra
for K = R, H and a complex one for K = C.
Example 5.1.13 (Low-dimensional Clifford algebras Clr,s) By the universal prop-
erty, an associative algebra A of dimension 2r+s is isomorphic to Clr,s if there exists
a linear mapping F : Rr,s →A fulﬁlling
F(ei) · F(ej) + F(ej) · F(ei) =

2δij for i ≤r
−2δij for i > r
Thus, topresent Clr,s explicitlyas matrixalgebras, it is enoughtoﬁndsuchamapping.
This way, for the cases r + s ≤2, one obtains the isomorphisms
Cl0,1 = C , Cl1,0 = R ⊕R , Cl0,2 = H , Cl2,0 = R(2) , Cl1,1 = R(2) ,
(5.1.14)
with F given as follows:
Cl0,1 : F(e1) = i ,
Cl1,0 : F(e1) = (1, −1) ,
Cl0,2 :
F(e1) =

The reader can check the condition (5.1.4) in each case (Exercise 5.1.2).
♦
Together with the Clifford algebras Clr,s, let us consider their complexiﬁcations
Clr,s ⊗R C.
Proposition 5.1.14 Let (V, q) be a real quadratic space and let (VC, qC) be its
complexiﬁcation.5 Then, the following isomorphism of complex algebras holds:
Cl(VC, qC) ∼= Cl(V, q) ⊗R C .
(5.1.15)
5Here, qC(v ⊗z) = z2q(v).

5.1 Clifford Algebras
361
Proof Consider the mapping
F : V ⊗R C →Cl(V, q) ⊗R C ,
F(v ⊗z) := j(v) ⊗z .
Then,
F(v ⊗z)2 = j(v)2 ⊗z2 = q(v)z2 · 1 ⊗1 = q(v ⊗z) · 1 ,
and, thus, the universal property yields the assertion.
■
We denote Clc
n := Cl(Cn, qC). Since every non-degenerate quadratic form q over C
can be written in some orthonormal basis as q(z1, . . . , zn) = z2
1 + . . . + z2
n, we have
Clc
n ∼= Cln,0 ⊗R C ∼= Cln−1,1 ⊗R C ∼= . . . ∼= Cl0,n ⊗R C ,
(5.1.16)
that is, all Clr,s are real forms of Clc
r+s.
The ﬁrst of the following two propositions allows for an explicit calculation of
the algebras Clr,s as matrix algebras over R, C or H, the second one is useful in
representation theory.
Proposition 5.1.15 For the pseudo-orthogonal Clifford algebras, the following iso-
morphisms hold:
Cln,0 ⊗Cl0,2 ∼= Cl0,n+2 ,
(5.1.17)
Cl0,n ⊗Cl2,0 ∼= Cln+2,0 ,
(5.1.18)
Clr,s ⊗Cl1,1 ∼= Clr+1,s+1 .
(5.1.19)
Proof We give the proof of the isomorphism (5.1.17). The proof of the remaining
two assertions is similar and is, therefore, left to the reader (Exercise 5.1.3). Let
e1, . . . , en+2 be a q-orthonormal basis of R0,n+2 generating Cl0,n+2. Then, the ﬁrst n
of these vectors generate the algebras Cl0,n and Cln,0. Viewed as generators of Cln,0,
they are denoted by e′
1, . . . , e′
n. We deﬁne
F : R0,n+2 →Cln,0 ⊗Cl0,2 ,
F(ei) := 1 ⊗ei , F(ek) := e′
k−2 ⊗e1 · e2 ,
for i = 1, 2 and 3 ≤k ≤n + 2. We calculate, for i = 1, 2,
F(ei)2 = (1 ⊗ei) · (1 ⊗ei) = 1 ⊗e2
i = −1 ,
and, for 3 ≤k ≤n + 2,
F(ek)2 = (e′
k−2 ⊗e1 · e2) · (e′
k−2 ⊗e1 · e2) = (e′
k−2)2 ⊗e1 · e2 · e1 · e2 .
Since (e′
k−2)2 = 1 and e1 · e2 · e1 · e2 = −e2
1 · e2
2 = −1, we get F(ek)2 = −1. Thus,
by the universal property, there exists an algebra homomorphism

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
ˆF : Cl0,n+2 →Cln,0 ⊗Cl0,2
fulﬁlling ˆF ◦j = F, which is obviously surjective. By Corollary 5.1.8, dim Cl0,n+2 =
dim(Cln,0 ⊗Cl0,2) and, thus, ˆF is an isomorphism.
■
Proposition 5.1.16 The following isomorphism holds:
Cl0
r+1,s ∼= Cls,r .
(5.1.20)
Proof Let q and ˜q be the quadratic forms in Clr+1,s and Cls,r, respectively. Let
e1, . . . , er+s+1 be a q-orthonormal basis of Rr+s+1 fulﬁlling q(ei) = 1 for 1 ≤i ≤
r + 1 and q(ei) = −1 for i > r. Let Rr+s = span {ei : i ̸= r + 1}. We deﬁne
F : Rr+s →Cl0
r+1,s ,
F(ei) := er+1ei
for i ̸= r + 1. Let x = 
i̸=r+1 xiei ∈Rr+s. Using e2
r+1 = +1 and er+1ei = −eier+1
for any i ̸= r + 1, we calculate
F(x)2 =

i,j
xixjer+1eier+1ej = −

i,j
xixjeiej = −q(x)1 = ˜q(x)1 .
Thus, by the universal property, there exists an algebra homomorphism ˆF : Cls,r →
Cl0
r+1,s which is easily seen to be an isomorphism.
■
Remark 5.1.17 Similarly, as in Proposition 5.1.16, one shows (Exercise 5.1.4)
Cl0
r,s+1 ∼= Clr,s .
(5.1.21)
We conclude that Cl0
r,s and Cl0
s,r are isomorphic.
♦
Remark 5.1.18 (Classiﬁcation of pseudo-orthogonal Clifford algebras) Recall the
following elementary isomorphisms:
R(n) ⊗R(m) ∼= R(nm) , R(n) ⊗R C ∼= C(n) , R(n) ⊗R H ∼= H(n) ,
(5.1.22)
and
C ⊗R C ∼= C ⊕C , C ⊗R H ∼= C(2) , H ⊗R H ∼= R(4) .
(5.1.23)
Now, using Proposition 5.1.15, together with (5.1.16) and the above isomorphisms,
one may calculate iteratively all Clifford algebras Clr,s, starting from the isomor-
phisms given in (5.1.14). On the way, one ﬁnds the following periodicity isomor-
phisms (Exercise 5.1.5), which make the classiﬁcation table ﬁnite:
Cln+8,0 ∼= Cln,0 ⊗Cl8,0 ,
Cl0,n+8 ∼= Cl0,n ⊗Cl0,8 .
(5.1.24)
For the ﬁnal result, we refer the reader to Table2 in Sect.1.4 of [407].
♦

5.1 Clifford Algebras
363
As a simple consequence of the above discussion, we obtain the following.
Proposition 5.1.19 The following isomorphisms hold:
Clc
n+2 ∼= Clc
n ⊗C C(2) ,
Clc
2n ∼= C(2n) ,
Clc
2n+1 ∼= C(2n) ⊕C(2n) .
(5.1.25)
Proof By (5.1.16) and (5.1.17),
Clc
n+2 ∼= Cl0,n+2 ⊗R C ∼= (Cln,0 ⊗Cl0,2) ⊗R C ∼= (Cln,0 ⊗R C) ⊗C (Cl0,2 ⊗R C)
and, thus, Clc
n+2 ∼= Clc
n ⊗C Clc
2. In particular, by (5.1.14), we obtain
Clc
2 ∼= Cl2,0 ⊗R C ∼= R(2) ⊗R C ∼= C(2) ,
and, thus, Clc
n+2 ∼= Clc
n⊗CC(2) indeed. Now, again by (5.1.14), we have Clc
1 ∼= C⊕C.
Using this, together with Clc
2 ∼= C(2), and iterating Clc
n+2 ∼= Clc
n ⊗C C(2) we obtain
Clc
2n ∼=

C(2) ∼= End

■
We note that the formulae contained in (5.1.25) in fact yield representations of Clc
n
by endomorphisms on a complex vector space. These will be systematically studied
in Sect.5.3.
Remark 5.1.20 An explicit formula for the ﬁrst of the isomorphisms in (5.1.25) can
be easily deduced from the proof of Proposition 5.1.15. For later use, we provide
explicit formulae for the second and the third one in terms of generators ej fulﬁlling
(5.1.13), see also [59]. Given Rr,s, we denote
W =
1 0

,
V =
0 i
i 0

τ(j) =

 i for j ≤r
1 for j > r
Then, for n = r+s = 2k, we deﬁne the mapping γ2k : Rr,s →End

C2n ∼=

by
γ2k(e2j−1) := τ(2j −1) W ⊗. . . ⊗W ⊗U ⊗1 ⊗. . . ⊗1 ,
γ2k(e2j) := τ(2j) W ⊗. . . ⊗W ⊗V ⊗1 ⊗. . . ⊗1 ,
where the matrices U and V are at position j, respectively. It is easy to check (Exercise
5.1.6) that the matrices γ (ej) fulﬁl the relations (5.1.13). Thus, by universality, γ

We stress that the above explicit presentation of the isomorphisms (5.1.25) is by no
means unique.
♦
Example 5.1.21 (Clifford algebra of Minkowski space) Recall the Minkowski space
(M, η) from Example I/4.5.9. In the above notation, M = R1,3 and ημν
=
diag(+1, −1, −1, −1) , μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3, in the standard basis {eμ} of R4. Thus, the
Clifford algebra of the Minkowski space coincides with Cl1,3. By Proposition 5.1.19,
we have Clc
4 = Cl1,3 ⊗R C ∼= C(4). Thus, passing to the complexiﬁcation, we can
represent the generators of Cl1,3 explicitly in terms of complex 4 × 4-matrices. One

5.2 Spinor Groups

5.2
Spinor Groups
In this section, we exhibit natural group structures within a given Clifford algebra
Cl(V, q).Asbefore,weassumethatdim V < ∞andthattheﬁeldKhascharacteristic
zero. For simplicity, we will often omit the Clifford algebra product symbol.
In the sequel, elements v ∈V fulﬁlling q(v) = 0 will be called isotropic and ele-
mentsfulﬁlling q(v) ̸= 0 willbereferredtoasanisotropic.Notethateveryanisotropic
element is invertible, with the inverse given by v−1 = v/q(v). Thus, endowed with
the multiplication from Cl(V, q), the set Cl(V, q)∗of invertible elements of Cl(V, q)
acquires a group structure. Cl(V, q)∗will be referred to as the group of units of
Cl(V, q). Using the parity automorphism p, we deﬁne the following Lie subgroup,
called the Clifford group of (V, q):
Γ (V, q) :=

a ∈Cl(V, q)∗: p(a)va−1 ∈V for all v ∈V

.
(5.2.1)
By this deﬁnition, the Clifford group comes with a natural representation

Ad : Γ (V, q) →Aut(V) ,

Ad(a)v := p(a)va−1 ,
(5.2.2)
called the twisted adjoint representation.
Lemma 5.2.1 The twisted adjoint representation has the following properties.
1. For any a ∈Γ (V, q), we have 
Ad(p(a)) = 
Ad(a).
2. For everyanisotropicelement v ∈V, themapping 
Ad(v) : V →V is thereﬂection
about the hyperplane in V orthogonal to v, that is, for all w ∈V,

Ad(v)w = w −2η(v, w)
q(v)
v .
(5.2.3)
3. If q is non-degenerate, then the kernel of 
Ad coincides with the multiplicative
group K∗· 1 of non-zero multiples of the identity in Cl(V, q).
Proof To prove the ﬁrst assertion, we apply −p to 
Ad(a)v = p(a)va−1. This yields

Ad(a)v = −p(
Ad(a)v) = avp(a−1) = 
Ad(p(a))v .
Next, since v2 = q(v) · 1, we have v−1 = v(q(v))−1 and, thus,
q(v)
Ad(v)w = −q(v)vwv−1 = −vwv = v2w −2η(v, w)v = q(v)w −2η(v, w)v .
Thus, (5.2.3) holds. It remains to prove the third assertion. Since q is non-degenerate,
we can choose a q-orthogonal basis e1, . . . en in V such that q(ei) ̸= 0 for all i =
1, . . . , n. Let a ∈ker

Ad

va0 = a0v ,
−va1 = a1v ,
(5.2.4)

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
where a0 and a1 denote the even and odd parts of a, respectively. Using (5.1.6),
we may write a0 = p0 + e1p1 where p0 and p1 are polynomials in the generators
e2, . . . en. Clearly, p0 is even and p1 is odd. Using (5.2.4) with v = e1, we calculate
e1p0 + e2
1p1 = e1(p0 + e1p1) = (p0 + e1p1)e1 = p0e1 + e1p1e1 = e1p0 −e2
1p1 .
Thus, e2
1p1 = q(e1)p1 = 0 and, hence, p1 = 0. This shows that a0 does not contain
e1. Proceeding inductively, we obtain that a0 does not contain any of the generators
ei, that is, a0 = k · 1 where k ∈K. In the same way, one shows that a1 does not
contain any of the generators ei. Thus, being odd it must vanish. We conclude that
a = k · 1. Since, by assumption a ̸= 0, we have a ∈K∗· 1.
■
Remark 5.2.2 By point 1 of Lemma 5.2.1, for every v ∈V, we have

Ad(a−1p(a))v = v ,
and, by point 3 of that lemma, we conclude p(a) = ka with k ∈K∗. Moreover, since
p is involutive, we obtain k2 = 1. Now, by assumption, K has characteristic zero and,
thus, the only solutions of this equation are k = ±1. We conclude that any element
of Γ (V, q) has a deﬁnite parity, that is, it is either even or odd.
♦
Let us denote by O(V, q) the orthogonal group of the quadratic space (V, q), that
is, the subgroup of Aut(V, q) leaving q invariant. Correspondingly, let SO(V, q) ⊂
O(V, q) be the subgroup of transformations of determinant 1.
Theorem 5.2.3 Let (V, q) be a quadratic space with q non-degenerate. Then, the
twisted adjoint representation deﬁnes the short exact sequence
1→K∗· 1→Γ (V, q)

Ad
−→O(V, q)→1 .
(5.2.5)
Proof By point 3 of Lemma 5.2.1, the kernel of 
Ad coincides with K∗· 1. We show

Ad(Γ (V, q)) ⊂O(V, q). Using point 1 of Lemma 5.2.1, for any v, w ∈V and any
a ∈Γ (v, q), we calculate
2η(
Ad(a)v, 
Ad(a)w) = 
Ad(a)v · 
Ad(a)w + 
Ad(a)w · 
Ad(a)v

Ad(p(a))w + 
Ad(a)w · 
Ad(p(a))v
= p(a)(v · w + w · v)p(a−1)
= 2η(v, w) .
Finally, by the Cartan-Dieudonné Theorem, for a non-degenerate quadratic vector
space (V, q), any element R ∈O(V, q) can be written as a product of k reﬂections,
R = R1 . . . Rk with k ≤dim V.7 But, by point 2 of Lemma 5.2.1, every reﬂection
7See e.g. [23] or [439]. A reﬂection is, by deﬁnition, an orthogonal transformation R ∈O(V, q)
whose ﬁxed point set ker(R −1) has codimension 1. It can be shown that any reﬂection is of the
form given by the right hand side of (5.2.3) with v unique up to a non-zero scalar.

in (V, q) through an anisotropic vector belongs to 
Ad(Γ (V, q)). Thus, since 
Ad :
Γ (V, q) →O(V, q) is a homomorphism, there exist anisotropic elements v1, . . . , vk
in V such that Ri = 
Ad(vi) and, thus, R = 
Ad(a) with a = v1 . . . vk. This implies
that 
Ad is surjective.
■
Remark 5.2.4
1. Since ker(
Ad) = K∗· 1 and im(
Ad) = O(V, q), any element a ∈Γ (V, q) must
be a product of anisotropic elements vi of V, that is, a = v1 . . . vk with k ≤dim V.
Clearly, p(a) = (−1)ka.
2. We denote
Γ 0(V, q) := Γ (V, q) ∩Cl0(V, q)∗
and call it the special Clifford group. It clearly consists of products v1 . . . vk with
k even and we have the following short exact sequence induced from (5.2.5):
1→K∗· 1→Γ 0(V, q)

Ad
−→SO(V, q)→1 .
(5.2.6)
♦
Next, recall the canonical anti-automorphism t of Cl(V, q) constructed in the proof
of Proposition 5.1.5. By point 3 of Remark 5.1.6, it commutes with the parity auto-
morphism p. The following is a direct consequence of the deﬁnition of Γ (V, q) and
is, therefore, left to the reader (Exercise 5.2.1).
Lemma 5.2.5 The mappings p and t induce an automorphism and an anti-
automorphism of Γ (V, q), respectively.
■
For any a ∈Cl(V, q), we deﬁne the anti-automorphism
a →˜a := t ◦p(a) .
(5.2.7)
Clearly, 
ab = ˜b˜a and ˜˜a = a. Correspondingly, we have a natural norm mapping
N : Cl(V, q) →Cl(V, q) ,
N(a) := a˜a .
(5.2.8)
Note that, for any v ∈V,
N(v) = −q(v) .
(5.2.9)
Lemma 5.2.6 Let (V, q) be a quadratic space with q non-degenerate. Then, the
restriction of N to Γ (V, q) is a group homomorphism Γ (V, q) →K∗· 1. Moreover,
N(p(a)) = N(a) for any a ∈Γ (V, q).
Proof Let a ∈Γ (V, q). Then, p(a)va−1 ∈V for any v ∈V. Applying t, we obtain
t(a)−1v ˜a = p(a)va−1, because t is the identity on V. Using this, we have

and
Theorem5.2.3 implies N(Γ (V, q)) ⊂K∗· 1.
We prove that the restriction of N is a homomorphism. Using N(Γ (V, q)) ⊂K∗·1,
for any a, b ∈Γ (V, q), we calculate
N(ab) = ab˜b˜a = aN(b)˜a = N(a)N(b) .
Finally, again using N(Γ (V, q)) ⊂K∗· 1, for any a ∈Γ (V, q),
N(p(a)) = p(a)p(˜a) = p(a˜a) = N(a) .
■
We deﬁne8
Pin(V, q) := {a ∈Γ (V, q) : N(a) = 1}
(5.2.10)
and
Spin(V, q) := Pin(V, q) ∩Γ 0(V, q) .
(5.2.11)
By Lemma 5.2.6, the restriction of N to Γ (V, q) is a group homomorphism
Γ (V, q) →K∗·1. Thus, Pin(V, q) and Spin(V, q) are normal subgroups of Γ (V, q)
and Γ 0(V, q), respectively.
Deﬁnition 5.2.7 The groups Pin(V, q) and Spin(V, q) will be referred to as the pin
group and the spin group of (V, q), respectively.
In general, the restrictions of 
Ad to Pin(V, q) and Spin(V, q) are not surjective onto
O(V, q) and SO(V, q), respectively. However, for a special class of base ﬁelds, called
spin ﬁelds, surjectivity holds. In particular, R and C are spin ﬁelds. We refer to [407]
for a detailed discussion.
Let us consider the Clifford algebra Clr,s of the real vector space V = Rr,s
endowed with the pseudo-Euclidean quadratic form given by (5.1.12) in some detail.
Inthiscase,wedenotethegroupofunits,theCliffordgroup,thepingroupandthespin
group by, respectively, Cl∗
r,s, Γr,s, Pinr,s and Spinr,s. Correspondingly, the orthogonal
and the special orthogonal groups are denoted by Or,s and SOr,s, respectively. We
also write Pin(n) = Pinn,0 and Spin(n) = Spinn,0. Since Clr,s is a ﬁnite-dimensional
associative R-algebra, Cl∗
r,s is a Lie group with a global chart given by the natural
inclusion mapping. By construction, Γr,s, Pinr,s and Spinr,s are Lie subgroups of
Cl∗
r,s. By Remark 5.1.17, Cl0
r,s and Cl0
s,r are isomorphic. This implies that Spinr,s and
Spins,r are isomorphic, too.9 Theorem 5.2.3 implies the following.
8For K = R, one often deﬁnes Pin(V, q) by the condition N(a) = ±1. Then, Theorem 5.2.3 implies
surjective mappings onto O(V, q) and SO(V, q), respectively. This leads to an obvious modiﬁcation
of Corollary 5.2.8.
9Note, however, that Pinr,s and Pins,r are in general not isomorphic.

5.2 Spinor Groups
369
Corollary 5.2.8 For every pair (r, s), Spinr,s is a double covering of the identity
component SO0
r,s, that is, there is an exact sequence
1 →Z2 →Spinr,s →SO0
r,s →1 .
(5.2.12)
For r ≥2 or s ≥2, the group Spinr,s is connected.
Proof Since the condition N(a) = 1 yields a normalization of generators only, the
existence of the exact sequences is a direct consequence of Theorem 5.2.3. In par-
ticular, the intersection of ker(
Ad) with Pinr,s is clearly Z2. It remains to prove the
second assertion. The cases (r, s) = (0, 1) and (r, s) = (1, 0) are clearly trivial. For
(r, s) = (1, 1) one obtains SO0
1,1 = R+ and Spin1,1 = Z2 × R+ which is discon-
nected. Now, assume r ≥2 or s ≥2. By (5.2.12), the kernel of Spinr,s →SO0
r,s
is {1, −1}. Thus, it is enough to construct a path joining 1 and −1 in Spinr,s. By
the above assumption, Rr,s contains a 2-dimensional subspace isomorphic to R2,0 or
to R0,2. Thus, there exist two anisotropic orthogonal vectors e1, e2 ∈Rr,s fulﬁlling
q(e1) = q(e2) = ±1. Now,
t →γ (t) = (e1 cos(t) + e2 sin(t))(e2 sin(t) −e1 cos(t)) ,
t ∈[0, π
2 ] ,
is a continuous path with the required property.
■
Remark 5.2.9 The spin groups are, in general, not simply connected. Using the fact
that SO0
r,s is homotopic to the maximal compact subgroup SO(r)×SO(s), one obtains
π1(SO0
r,s) = π1(SO(r)) ⊕π1(SO(s)). Then, using
π1(SO(r)) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
0 for r = 1
Z for r = 2
Z2 for r > 2
one can calculate π1(SO0
r,s) for any pair (r, s). Next, using the natural embeddings
SO(r) × SO(s) →SO0
r,s, together with the corresponding embeddings on the level
of the spin group, one can calculate π1(Spinr,s) as well, see [59] for a complete
list. If both r > 2 and s > 2, then the fundamental group of SOr,s is Z2 × Z2
and, thus π1(Spinr,s) = Z2 in that case. We conclude that the spin group is simply
connected and, thus, that the covering λ : Spinr,s →SO0
r,s is universal in the cases
r > 2, s = 0, 1, and r = 0, 1 , s > 2 only.
♦
By Proposition 5.1.16, we have Spinr,s ⊂Cl0
r,s ∼= Cls,r−1 for any r ≥1. Thus, there
are two possibilities for explicit matrix realizations of Spinr,s. We illustrate this for
the spin group of the Minkowski space. Details are left to the reader (Exercise 5.2.3).
Example 5.2.10 (Spin group of the Minkowski space) We take up Example 5.1.21.
Here, we consider the spin group Spin1,3 ⊂Cl0
1,3 ∼= Cl3,0 of (M, η).

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
1. We construct Spin1,3 ⊂Cl3,0. By (5.1.18) and (5.1.14), Cl3,0 ∼= C(2) = End(C2).
In terms of generators, this isomorphism reads:
e1 =
1 0
0 −1

,
e2 =
0 1
1 0

,
e3 =
 0 i
−i 0

.
Representing the elements {1, e1, e2, e3, e1e2, e1e3, e2e3, e1e2e3} of the vector
space basis of Cl3,0 in this way, one easily calculates:
Z =
a b
c d

→p(Z) =
 d −c
−b a

,
Z =
a b
c d

→˜Z =
 d −b
−c a

,
where a, b, c, d ∈C. Thus,
Z · p(Z)† = det Z · 1 ,
N(Z) = det Z · 1 .
The second of these equations reduces C(2) to SL(2, C). We identify
M →H(2, C) ,
x →x∗:= xμσμ ,
where H(2, C) is the space of Hermitean (2 × 2)-matrices, cf. Example I/5.1.13.
For g ∈SL(2, C), we have g·p(g)† = 1. Thus, via the automorphism g →(g−1)†
of SL(2, C), the twisted adjoint representation may be identiﬁed with

Ad(g)x∗= g x∗g† ,
g ∈SL(2, C) .
Finally, note that the hermiticity of x∗implies the hermiticity of 
Ad(g)x∗for any
g ∈SL(2, C). Thus, we obtain
Spin1,3 ∼= SL(2, C)
(5.2.13)
realized in End(C2). This is one of the special isomorphisms for low-dimensional
spin groups which will be further discussed below. In this presentation, the uni-
versal covering λ : Spin1,3 →SO0
1,3 is given by (λ(g)x)∗= g x∗g† , cf. Example
I/5.1.13. Restricting λ to the subgroup SU(2) ⊂SL(2, C), one obtains the uni-
versal covering homomorphism SU(2) →SO(3), see Example I/5.1.11. This,
together with (2.8.2), proves
Spin(3) ∼= SU(2) ,
Spin(4) ∼= SU(2) × SU(2) .
(5.2.14)
2. We construct Spin1,3 ⊂Cl0
1,3. By (5.1.19) and (5.1.14), Cl1,3 ∼= Cl0,2 ⊗Cl1,1 =
H ⊗R(2) ∼= H(2). The latter may be identiﬁed with a subalgebra of C(4),
Cl1,3 ∼=

Z =

via the mapping
γ : R1,3 →C(4) ,
x →γ (x) =
 0 x∗
x∗0

,
cf. (5.1.26). Here,10 x∗= xμ ˜σμ, z = zμσμ and z′ = zμ ˜σμ (and the same for w).
One easily calculates
p(Z) =
 z
−w
−w′ z′

.
By (5.2.11), we must require N(Z) = 1 and Z ∈Γ 0(R1,3). The latter implies
w = 0 and then, by point 1,
N(Z) =
det(z)
0
0
det(z)

.
Thus, we obtain det(z) = 1. Now, applying the twisted adjoint representation for
Z fulﬁlling w = 0 and det(z) = 1, we obtain
x∗→
Ad(Z)x∗= z x∗z† .
Clearly, the hermiticity of x implies the hermiticity of z x z† and, thus,
Spin1,3 =

Example 5.2.11 (Low-dimensional spin groups)
The following isomorphisms
between low-dimensional spin groups and classical Lie groups can be conﬁrmed
by analogous arguments as in Example 5.2.10. For the compact spin groups, we
have11
Spin(2) ∼= U(1) ,
Spin(3) ∼= SU(2) ,
Spin(4) ∼= SU(2) × SU(2) ,
Spin(5) ∼= Sp(2) ,
Spin(6) ∼= SU(4) .
10See Example 5.1.21 for the notation.
11The ﬁrst identity is trivial, the second and the third one were shown in Example 5.2.10 and the
remaining two will be shown in Example 5.3.22.

For a discussion of Spin(7), Spin(8) and relations between spin groups and excep-
tional groups we refer to [8, 9, 286, 407, 439]. For the non-compact spin groups, we
have12
Spin2,1 ∼= SL(2, R) ,
Spin1,3 ∼= SL(2, C) , Spin2,2 ∼= SL(2, R) × SL(2, R)
Spin1,4 ∼= Sp1,1(H) , Spin2,3 ∼= Sp(4, R) ,

where Sp1,1(H) =

Next, let us consider the case V = (Cn, q) where q is the quadratic form given
by the standard Hermitean form on Cn. We denote Pin(n, C) = Pin(Cn, q) and
Spin(n, C) = Spin(Cn, q). The following statements are left to the reader (Exercise
5.2.4).
Proposition 5.2.12 The groups Pin(n, C) and Spin(n, C) are double covers of
O(n, C) and SO(n, C), respectively. Moreover, Spin(n, C) is the universal cover-
ing of SO(n, C) and Spin(n) is its maximal compact subgroup.
Note that Clc
n = Cln ⊗C contains both Spin(n) ⊂Cln ⊗1 and S1 ∼= U(1) ⊂1 ⊗C.
Deﬁnition 5.2.13 (Complex spin group) The complex spin group13 Spinc(n) is the
subgroup of Cln ⊗C generated by Spin(n) and by U(1).
Since obviously Spin(n) ∩U(1) = {1, −1}, we have an isomorphism
Spinc(n) ∼= (Spin(n) × U(1)) /{±1} ≡Spin(n) ×Z2 U(1) ,
(5.2.16)
that is, elements of Spinc(n) are equivalence classes [(g, z)] of pairs (g, z) ∈
Spin(n)×U(1) under the equivalence relation (g, z) ∼(−g, −z). Note that Corollary
5.2.8 immediately implies the following exact sequence
1 →Z2 →Spinc(n)
p→SO(n) × U(1) →1 ,
(5.2.17)
where
p : Spinc(n) →SO(n) × U(1) ,
(g, z) →(ρ(g), z2) ,
(5.2.18)
12Recall that, by Corollary 5.2.8, for r ≥2 or s ≥2, the group Spinr,s is connected. Also recall
that Spinr,s = Spins,r.
13Also called the Spinc-group.

5.2 Spinor Groups
373
and ρ : Spin(n) →SO(n) is the double covering given by (5.2.12). As an immediate
consequence of this sequence, we obtain
π1(Spinc(n)) ∼= Z .
(5.2.19)
Now, let n = 2k. Recall from Example 2.2.19 that we can view U(k) as a subgroup
of SO(2n). Let
f : U(k) →SO(2k) × U(1) ,
f (a) := (a, det(a)),
(5.2.20)
be the group homomorphism induced by this embedding. The following proposition
shows that this homomorphism admits a natural lift to the Spinc-group.

inspection, under this mapping, the above diagram becomes commutative.

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Finally, we discuss Lie algebra structures in Cl(V, q). We assume that K be R
or C and that q be non-degenerate. Since Cl(V, q) is an associative K-algebra, it
carries a natural Lie algebra structure. We denote its Lie bracket by [·, ·]. Moreover,
the group of units, the Clifford group, the pin group and the spin group are Lie
groups. The Lie algebra cl(V, q)∗of the group of units Cl(V, q)∗clearly coincides
with Cl(V, q) viewed as a Lie algebra and there is an exponential mapping given by
the usual exponential series (Exercise 5.2.5),
exp : cl(V, q)∗→Cl(V, q)∗,
exp(A) = 1
n!

n
An .
(5.2.23)
Using this, we can calculate the Lie algebra of the Clifford group. Limiting our
attention to the special Clifford group Γ 0(V, q), we obtain
Lie(Γ 0(V, q)) =

A ∈Cl0(V, q) : Av −vA ∈V for all v ∈V

.
Since, under the above assumptions, the restriction of 
Ad to both the pin and the
spin group14 are covering homomorphisms onto subgroups of full dimension of the
corresponding orthogonal groups, their Lie algebras clearly coincide with the Lie
algebra of the orthogonal group. Let us denote the Lie algebras of the spin group
and of the orthogonal group by spin(V, q) and o(V, q), respectively. Consider the
subspace
Cl2(V, q) := span

eiej : 1 ≤i < j ≤dim V

⊂Cl(V, q) ,
where {ei} is a q-orthogonal basis of V. By (5.1.11) and by the deﬁning relations
(5.1.2), Cl2(V, q) is a Lie subalgebra of Cl(V, q) with Lie bracket
[eiej, ekel] = 2ei(ηkjel −ηljek) + 2(ηkiel −ηliek)ej ,
(5.2.24)
where ηrs = η(er, es). By (5.1.11), c(2V) ∼= Cl2(V, q) as vector spaces. Thus, we
may endow 2V with the structure of a Lie algebra by setting
[α, β]∧2V := c−1 ◦[c(α), c(β)] .
(5.2.25)
Proposition 5.2.15 The image of the mapping15
ψ : 2V →End(V) ,
ψ(α)v := −2η(v)⌟α
(5.2.26)
coincides with o(V, q). Moreover, ψ is a Lie algebra isomorphism.
14Viewed as real Lie groups.
15In the formula below, ψ(α)v may be viewed as the supercommutator [c(α), v], cf. [72] or [439].

5.2 Spinor Groups
375
The deﬁning equation of ψ immediately implies
ψ(u ∧v)w = 2η(w, v)u −2η(w, u)v ,
u, v, w ∈V .
(5.2.27)
Proof For any v, w ∈V and any α ∈2V, we calculate
η(ψ(α)v, w) = η(w)⌟(ψ(α)v)
= −2η(w)⌟η(v)⌟α
= 2η(v)⌟η(w)⌟α
= −η(v, ψ(α)w) ,
showing that im(ψ) ⊂o(V, q). Next, using (5.2.27) and (5.2.24), one shows that ψ
is a homomorphism (Exercise 5.2.7). Finally, ψ is obviously injective and thus, by
dimension counting, it is also surjective.
■
Remark 5.2.16 Let {ei} be a q-orthogonal basis in V and let {ϑi} be its dual, that is,
η−1(ϑi) = ηijej. Then, using (5.2.27), one calculates
1
4ψ(ei ∧ej)(ek) ∧η−1(ϑk) = ei ∧ej .
Thus, ψ is the inverse of the isomorphism κ : o(V, q) →2V given by (2.2.38).
This way, κ becomes a Lie algebra isomorphism. Combining it with c : 2V →
Cl2(V, q), we obtain the Lie algebra isomorphism
ϕ = c ◦κ : o(V, q) →Cl2(V, q) ,
ϕ(A) = 1

which can be easily shown to be equal to (Exercise 5.2.8)
ϕ(A) = 1
4ηlmηknη(A ek, el) em · en = 1
4Alkel · ek .
(5.2.29)
Under the isomorphism ϕ, the action of A on an element v ∈V is given by (Exercise
5.2.8):
A(v) = [ϕ(A), v] .
(5.2.30)
Via ϕ, spin(V, q) is naturally identiﬁed with Cl2(V, q). Thus, {eiej : i < j} form a
natural basis in spin(V, q) corresponding to the basis {ψ(ei ∧ej) : i < j} in o(V, q).
By (5.2.27), the matrix of ψ(ei ∧ej) in the basis {ei} coincides with the matrix 2Eij,
where
(Eij)kl = ηljηki −ηliηkj .

(5.2.32)

5.3 Representations

5.3
Representations
In this section, we discuss representations of the Clifford algebra and of the spin
group.
Deﬁnition 5.3.1 Let (V, q) be a quadratic vector space over a commutative ﬁeld k,
let K ⊃k be a ﬁeld containing k and let W be a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space over
K. A K-representation of the Clifford algebra Cl(V, q) is a k-algebra homomorphism
ρ : Cl(V, q) →EndK(W) .
The representation space W is called a Cl(V, q)-module over K.
Example 5.3.2 The Clifford algebra Cl(V, q) itself, endowed with the module struc-
ture given by multiplication from the left, is a Clifford module. The exterior alge-
bra V is a Clifford module with the action given by the algebra homomorphism
ˆF : Cl(V, q) →End(V) constructed in the proof of Proposition 5.1.10. Recall
that on generators this action is given by the mapping
F : V →End(V) ,

cf. (5.1.7). The symbol mapping σ : Cl(V, q) →V is the unique isomorphism of
Clifford modules taking 1 ∈Cl(V, q) to 1 ∈V.
♦
Let us discuss the K-representations of Clr,s for K = R, C and H. Since we know
the classiﬁcation of these Clifford algebras in terms of matrix algebras, their repre-
sentation theory is provided by the classical theory of simple associative algebras.
By Theorem XVII.5.5 in [399], K(n) = End(Kn) is a simple ring and Kn is a sim-
ple K(n)-module. By Corollary XVII.4.5. in [399], this simple module provides the
unique irreducible representation of K(n). Correspondingly, the ring K(n) ⊕K(n)
has exactly two equivalence classes of irreducible representations given by projection
onto the ﬁrst and the second factor, respectively. Thus, by inspection of Table II in
Sect.1.4 of [407], one reads off the irreducible K-representations of Clr,s. According
to this table, the number of inequivalent irreducible representations is
νr,s =

2 if r + 1 −s = 0 (mod 4)
1 otherwise
Next, let us consider Clc
n. By Proposition 5.1.19,
Clc
2k ∼= C(2k) ,
Clc
2k+1 ∼= C(2k) ⊕C(2k) .
(5.3.1)
Thus, by the above cited theorem, Clc
2k has a unique faithful irreducible representation

Δ2k+1 = C2k .
(5.3.3)
Thus, Clc
2k+1 has two irreducible representations obtained by projecting onto the ﬁrst
and onto the second summand of Δ2k+1 ⊕Δ2k+1, respectively. Explicit formulae for
γn are given in Remark 5.1.20. By (5.1.25), the following diagram commutes:

(5.3.4)
Here, ι denotes the diagonal embedding. In the sequel, Δn will be called the space
of complex n-spinors, or, the n-spinor module and the corresponding representation
γn will be referred to as a spin representation of Clc
n. Frequently, we will omit the
index and simply write γ .
For further reference, we include the following.
Remark 5.3.3 Let E be a complex Cl(V, q)-module and let dim V be even. Then, by
Proposition 5.1.19, Cl(V, q)c ∼= End(Δn) is simple and Δn is the unique irreducible
representation. We have16
E ∼= Δn ⊗W ,
(5.3.5)
where W = HomCl(V,q)c(Δn, E) is the vector space of homomorphisms Δn →E
commutingwiththeCl(V, q)c-action.BySchur'sLemma,End(W) ∼= EndCl(V,q)c(E).
Since End(E) ∼= End(Δn) ⊗End(W), we conclude
End(E) ∼= Cl(V, q)c ⊗EndCl(V,q)c(E) .
(5.3.6)
Note that in the second factor Cl(V, q)c may be replaced by Cl(V, q).
♦
Let us study the spin representations of Clc
n in more detail. For that purpose, we
consider the chirality element
Γn := ini [ n+1
2 ]c(v) ,
(5.3.7)
where v is the natural volume element of Rn corresponding to a given orientation.
For a chosen oriented orthonormal basis {ei} of Rn we have v = e1 ∧. . . ∧en and
Γn = ini [ n+1
2 ]e1 · . . . · en .
(5.3.8)
16See Proposition 3.1.6 in [254].

5.3 Representations
379
Note that for n = 2k, we obtain
Γ2k = ike1 · . . . · e2k .
(5.3.9)
Clearly, Γn does not depend on the choice of the oriented orthonormal basis.
Lemma 5.3.4 The chirality element has the following properties.
1. Γ 2
n = 1 for all n.
2. x · Γn = (−1)n−1Γn · x for all x ∈Rn.
In particular, if n is odd, then Γn belongs to the centre of Clc
n. If n is even, then
a · Γn = Γn · p(a) ,
a ∈Clc
n .
(5.3.10)
Proof The ﬁrst statement is trivial. Next, by (5.1.13), for any l = 1, . . . , n we have
el·c(v) = (−1)n−1c(v)·el.Thisimpliesx·c(v) = (−1)n−1c(v)·x foranyx ∈Rn.This
proves the second assertion. The latter immediately implies the remaining statements.
■
Since Γn is an involution, we have projectors
P+ := 1
2(1 + Γn) ,
P−:= 1
2(1 −Γn) ,
(5.3.11)
fulﬁlling
P+ + P−= 1 ,
P+P−= P−P+ = 0 .
(5.3.12)
Lemma 5.3.5 If n is odd, then Γn induces a decomposition
Clc
n = Cl+
n ⊕Cl−
n ,
Cl±
n := P± · Clc
n = Clc
n · P± ,
(5.3.13)
into isomorphic subalgebras fulﬁlling p(Cl±
n ) = Cl∓
n .
Proof By Lemma 5.3.4, Γn is central. Thus, P+ and P−are central, too, and Cl±
n are
ideals. Since Γn is an odd element, we have p(P±) = P∓. This implies p(Cl±
n ) = Cl∓
n
showing, in particular, that the two subalgebras are isomorphic.
■
Clearly, the two summands in (5.3.3) correspond to Cl+
n and Cl−
n , respectively. This
can be checked explicitly by viewing the second isomorphism in (5.3.1) as
Clc
2k+1 ∼= Clc
2k ⊗(C ⊕C) ∼= Clc
2k ⊗Clc
1
and using that the parity automorphism on Clc
1 is given by p(u, v) = (v, u). Since
p(Cl±
n ) = Cl∓
n , we also conclude that the algebra (Clc
n)0 is diagonally embedded in
the decomposition (5.3.13),

(5.3.14)
Next, using γ (Γn)2 = γ

Γ 2
n

= 1, we decompose the spinor module Δn for n even
into eigenspaces of γ (Γn) corresponding to the eigenvalues ±1:
Δn = Δ+
n ⊕Δ−
n ,
Δ±
n := {ψ ∈Δn : γ (Γn)(ψ) = ±ψ} .
(5.3.15)
The projectors onto Δ±
n are given by γ (P±).
Proposition 5.3.6 For the complexiﬁed Clifford algebra Clc
n, the following hold.
1. If n is odd, then the two isomorphism classes of irreducible spinor modules are
given by Δ+
n+1 and Δ−
n+1, respectively. In this case, there is a unique isomorphism
class of irreducible (Clc
n)0-modules of dimension 2
n−1
2 .
2. If n is even, then there are two isomorphism classes of irreducible (Clc
n)0-modules,
both of dimension 2
n
2 −1.
Proof 1. Let n be odd. By (5.1.20), (5.3.1) and (5.3.15), we have
Clc
n ∼= (Clc
n+1)0 ∼= End0(Δn+1) = End0(Δ+
n+1 ⊕Δ−
n+1) .
(5.3.16)
If F ∈Hom(Δ−
n+1, Δ+
n+1), then γ (Γ ) ◦F = −F ◦γ (Γ ). Let F = γ (a) with a even.
Then, γ (p(a)) = γ (a) and, since Γ is central,
γ (Γ ) ◦γ (a) = −γ (a) ◦γ (Γ ) = −γ (a · Γ ) = −γ (Γ · a) = −γ (Γ ) ◦γ (a) ,
that is, γ (a) = 0 and thus Hom0(Δ−
n+1, Δ+
n+1) = 0. Also Hom0(Δ+
n+1, Δ−
n+1) = 0
by the same argument. Moreover, for a ∈Clc
n+1 and ψ± ∈Δ±
n+1, we have
aψ± = ±aΓ ψ± = ±Γ p(a)ψ± = p(a)ψ± .
Thus, if aΔ±
n+1 ⊂Δ±
n+1, then a ∈(Clc
n+1)0. As a consequence, we obtain the follow-
ing decomposition of Clc
n into simple algebras:
Clc
n ∼= End(Δ+
n+1) ⊕End(Δ−
n+1) .
(5.3.17)
Since Γ is central, the subspaces Δ±
n+1 are Clc
n-invariant. This shows that Δ±
n+1 are
irreducible Clc
n-modules. Since they are distinguished by the action of Γ , they are
inequivalent. Thus, Cl±
n ∼= End(Δ±
n+1). By (5.3.14), the restrictions to (Clc
n)0 of the
two irreducible representations of Clc
n coincide yielding a unique isomorphism class
of (Clc
n)0-modules.
2. Let n be even. Then, (5.3.16) and (5.3.17) imply
(Clc
n)0 ∼= End(Δ+
n ) ⊕End(Δ−
n ) .

5.3 Representations
381
By Lemma 5.3.4, the subspaces Δ±
n are invariant under (Clc
n)0. Thus, (5.3.15) is a
decomposition of Δn into two inequivalent irreducible (Clc
n)0-modules.
■
Clearly, the irreducible representations in Proposition 5.3.6 are all faithful. Since
Pinr,s ⊂Clc
n and Spinr,s ⊂(Clc
n)0, with r + s = n, the faithful irreducible rep-
resentations of Clc
n and (Clc
n)0 constructed in Proposition 5.3.6 restrict to faithful
representations of Pinr,s and Spinr,s called pin and spin representations, respectively.
For Spinr,s, we have17

r + s = 2k ,
(5.3.18)
γr,s : Spinr,s →Aut(Δr+s) ,
r + s = 2k + 1 .
(5.3.19)
Proposition 5.3.7 The pin representations of Pinr,s and the spin representations of
Spinr,s are irreducible.
Proof If a subspace of a pin representation is invariant under Pinr,s, then it is also
invariant under the subalgebra of Clr,s generated by Pinr,s. We show that this subalge-
bra coincides with all of Clr,s. For that purpose, it sufﬁces to prove that V is spanned
by linear combinations of elements of Pinr,s ∩V. Obviously, the span of Pinr,s ∩V
contains the open subset consisting of all elements v ∈V fulﬁlling q(v) > 0 and,
therefore, the whole of V. The assertion for Spinr,s follows from the fact that
Spinr,s = Pinr,s ∩Cl0
r,s ,
because this implies that the subalgebra generated by Spinr,s coincides with the
intersection of the subalgebra generated by Pinr,s with Cl0
r,s.

extends to a representation of Spinc(n) via
γ ([(g, z)])(ψ) = z · γ (g)(ψ) ,
(5.3.20)
for any g ∈Spin(n), z ∈S1 and ψ ∈Δn. If n is even, then the splitting Δn =

n is Spinc-invariant and, thus, we have the two irreducible modules Δ±

where ˙g = (g†)−1. This yields the two inequivalent irreducible spinor modules

bases in these spaces, one obtains a frequently used calculus of dotted and undotted
spinors, φ = (φK) and ˜ϕ = ( ˜ϕ ˙K).
♦
Denote n = r + s. Since Rn ⊂Cln ⊂Clc
n, via the spin representation, any vector
x ∈Rn may be regarded as an endomorphism of Δn. We deﬁne
μ : Rn ⊗R Δn →Δn ,
μ(x ⊗ψ) := γ (x)ψ .
(5.3.22)
Deﬁnition 5.3.10 The mapping μ deﬁned by (5.3.22) will be referred to as the
Clifford multiplication.
Usually, we will simply write μ(x⊗ψ) ≡x·ψ. Using the quantization isomorphism
c, the Clifford multiplication may be extended to a mapping μ : Rn ⊗R Δn →Δn
as follows:
α · ψ ≡μ(α ⊗ψ) := γ (c(α))ψ .
(5.3.23)
For any x ∈Rn, α ∈Rn and ψ ∈Δn, the following holds (Exercise 5.3.1):
(x ∧α) · ψ = x · (α · ψ) + (x⌟α) · ψ .
(5.3.24)
As in Remark 5.2.9, we denote the covering homomorphism induced from 
Ad and
the induced Lie algebra homomorphism by
λ : Spinr,s →SO0
r,s ,
dλ : spinr,s →sor,s .
These mappings are given by (5.2.33).
Proposition 5.3.11 The Clifford multiplication has the following properties.
1. It is equivariant with respect to the Spinr,s-action,18 that is, for any a ∈Spinr,s,
α ∈Rn and ψ ∈Δn,
γ (a)(α · ψ) = (λ(a)α) · (γ (a)ψ) .
(5.3.25)
2. Let n = 2k. Then, the Clifford multiplication with a non-zero x ∈Rn yields a
vector space isomorphism Δ± →Δ∓.
18In other words, it is a homomorphism of Spin(r,s)-representations.

5.3 Representations
383
Proof The proof of the ﬁrst assertion is by induction with respect to the degree k of
α. For k = 1, α is a vector x ∈Rn. Then,
γ (a)(x · ψ) = γ (a)γ (x)(ψ)
= γ (a)γ (x)γ (a−1)γ (a)(ψ)
= γ (axa−1)γ (a)(ψ)
= γ (λ(a)x)(γ (a)(ψ))
= (λ(a)x) · (γ (a)(ψ)) .
Now, assume that (5.3.25) holds for all elements α ∈Rn of degree ≤k. Then,
using (5.3.24), for β := x ∧α we obtain
γ (a)((x ∧α) · ψ) = γ (a) (x · (α · ψ)) + γ (a) ((x⌟α) · ψ)
= (λ(a)x) · (γ (a)(α · ψ)) + (λ(a)(x⌟α)) · (γ (a)ψ)
= (λ(a)x) · (λ(a)α) · (γ (a)ψ) + ((λ(a)x)⌟(λ(a)α)) · (γ (a)ψ)
= ((λ(a)x) ∧(λ(a)α)) · (γ (a)ψ)
= (λ(a)β) · (γ (a)(ψ)) .
The second assertion is an immediate consequence of the fact that Γ anticommutes
with any non-vanishing vector x ∈Rn.
■
Now, let us focus on the case n = 2k. Then, there is a useful equivalent description
of the spinor modules.19 Consider the spinor module Δn together with its decomposi-
tion (5.3.15). As before, for n = r + s, we write V = Rr,s, q for the pseudo-Euclidean
quadratic form of V given by (5.1.12) and η for the corresponding bilinear form. The
extensions of q and η to VC = V ⊗C are denoted by the same symbols. Recall that
a subspace W ⊂VC is called isotropic if q(w) = 0 for all w ∈W. Given an isotropic
subspace W, one can ﬁnd a complementary isotropic subspace W′ ∼= W∗. For an
oriented orthonormal basis {ei} of VC we deﬁne
W := span

e2k−1 −i e2k : k = 1, . . . , n
2

, W′ := span

e2k−1 + i e2k : k = 1, . . . , n
2

,
and the isomorphism ϕ : W →(W′)∗by ϕ(w)(w′) := η(w, w′). It is now easy to
check (Exercise 5.3.2) that for v = w′ + w , w ∈W and w′ ∈W′,
η(w, w′) = 1
2q(v) ,
η(w, w) = 0 = η(w′, w′) .
(5.3.26)
19The following construction is at the heart of the general theory of spinor modules, see e.g. [439].

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
The corresponding decomposition VC = W′ ⊕W ∼= W∗⊕W is referred to as a
complex polarization of V. We deﬁne SW := W∗and endow SW with the structure
of a Clifford module by deﬁning the action of VC ∼= W∗⊕W on SW by20
ρW : W∗⊕W →End(SW) ,
ρW(ζ, w) :=
√
2(ε(ζ) + ι(w)) ,
(5.3.27)
where ε and ι denote exterior multiplication and contraction, respectively. Using the
anti-commutation relations for ε and ι, one can check that ρW(ζ, w)2 = q(ζ, w)1.
Thus, by universality, ρW extends to a representation of the Clifford algebra Clc
n on
SW. By construction, ρW is faithful and, by dimension counting and by the uniqueness
of the spinor module, we obtain the following.
Proposition 5.3.12 For n even, the spinor module Δn is isomorphic to the Clc
n-
module SW.
■
We decompose
SW = W∗= +W∗⊕−W∗
(5.3.28)
with respect to the Z2-grading of the exterior algebra and denote S+
W = +W∗and
S−
W = −W∗.
Proposition 5.3.13 The natural Z2-grading of SW is compatible with the Z2-grading
deﬁnedbythechiralityelement, that is, Γn acts as +1on+W∗andas −1on−W∗.
As a consequence,
Δ+
n ∼= S+
W ,
Δ−
n ∼= S−
W .
(5.3.29)
Proof We choose an oriented orthonormal basis {ei} and denote El :=
1
√
2(e2l−1 −
i e2l). It is easy to calculate Γn in this basis (Exercise 5.3.2):
Γn = (E1E1 −1) · . . . · (EkEk −1) .
(5.3.30)
Now, denoting the basis elements of SW ∼= W∗by EIl = Ei1 ∧. . . ∧Eil, where
Il = {i1, . . . , il}, the action of ρW(EiEi −1) on EIl yields obviously EIl if i /∈Il and
−EIl if i ∈Il. This implies
ρW(Γn)(EIl) = (−1)lEIl ,
which proves the assertion.
■
Correspondingly, we may consider SW := W. Here, the action of VC ∼= W∗⊕W
is given by
ρW : W∗⊕W →End(SW) ,
ρW(ζ, w) :=
√
2(ι(ζ) + ε(w)) ,
(5.3.31)
20The factor
√
2 is necessary in order to respect the Clifford algebra relations, because ε(ζ)ι(w) +
ι(w)ε(ζ) = ζ(w) = η(η−1(ζ), w), cf. formula (2.7.33).

5.3 Representations
385
which provides a representation ρW of Clc
n on SW. There is a natural non-degenerate
pairing between SW and SW, given by
(·, ·) : SW ⊗SW →C ,
(φ, ψ) :=

ι(φT)ψ

[0] ,
(5.3.32)
where the subscript [0] means taking the zero-order component in the exterior algebra
and the superscript T is deﬁned by
(α1 ∧α2 . . . ∧αk)T := αk ∧. . . ∧α2 ∧α1 ,
αi ∈W∗.
Using (5.3.27) and (5.3.31), one proves (Exercise 5.3.4)
(φ, ρW(ζ, w)ψ) = (ρW(ζ, w)φ, ψ)
(5.3.33)
for any ζ ∈W∗, w ∈W, φ ∈SW and ψ ∈SW. This, together with the non-degeneracy
of the pairing, implies the following isomorphism of Clifford modules:
SW ∼= S∗
W.
(5.3.34)
Thus, we may call SW the dual spinor module. Correspondingly, there is a natural
non-degenerate pairing on SW, given by
(·, ·)SW : SW ⊗SW →kW∗,
(φ1, φ2)SW :=

φT
1 ∧φ2

[top] ,
(5.3.35)
where the subscript [top] means taking the top-order component in the exterior alge-
bra.21 This pairing will be referred to as the canonical bilinear form on the spinor
module. One shows (Exercise 5.3.4) that, for any a ∈Clc
n,
(ρW(a)φ, ψ)SW = (φ, ρW(aT)ψ)SW .
(5.3.36)
Thus, choosing a trivialization kW∗∼= C, via (·, ·)SW we may identify SW ∼= S∗
W as
Clifford modules. Combined with (5.3.34), this yields an isomorphism SW ∼= SW.
Proposition 5.3.14 Let dim V = 2k. Then, the pairing (·, ·)SW is
1. symmetric if k = 0, 1 mod 4,
2. anti-symmetric if k = 2, 3 mod 4.
Moreover, if k = 0 mod 4 (respectively, k = 2 mod 4) it restricts to a non-degenerate
symmetric (respectively, anti-symmetric) form on both S+
W and S−
W. If k is odd, (·, ·)SW
vanishes both on S+
W and S−
W, thus, yielding a non-degenerate pairing between them.
21In complete analogy, there is a pairing on SW.

This proves the ﬁrst assertion. The remaining statements are left to the reader (Exer-
cise 5.3.3).
■
In the following example, details are left to the reader (Exercise 5.3.5).
Example 5.3.15 Here, we take up Examples 5.1.21 and 5.2.10 where we discussed
the Clifford algebra Cl1,3 of the Minkowski space (M, η) and its spin group. Consider
the complexiﬁcation MC = M ⊗C ∼= C4 together with Clc
4 ∼= Clc
1,3. If {ei} is the
standard basis in C4, then ˜e0 = e0, ˜ej = i ej, with j = 1, 2, 3, is an orthonormal
basis. As above, we pass to the basis deﬁned by El :=
1
√
2(˜e2l−1 −i ˜e2l) and E′
l :=
1
√
2(˜e2l−1+i ˜e2l), with l = 1, 2, and interchange the role of ˜e1 and ˜e3 for convenience.
In this basis, z ∈MC reads
z =

(z0 + z3)E1 + 1

(z0 −z3)E′
1 + 1
√

(z1 −iz2)E2 −1

(z1 + iz2)E′

where zμ are complex coordinates in the standard basis. This yields the complex
polarization MC = W+ ⊕W−, where
W± =

z ∈MC : z0 ∓z3 = 0 , z1 ± iz2 = 0

.
(5.3.37)
Clearly, W+ ∼= C2 ∼= W−. We consider the spinor module S = W+ and its
decomposition into its irreducible components
S = S+ ⊕S−,
S+ = +W+ = 0W+ ⊕2W+ ,
S−= −W+ = 1W+ .
Clearly, {1, E := E1 ∧E2} and {E1, E2} constitute bases in S+ and S−, respectively.
Since ρ(w) =

2ε(w) and ρ(η(w)) =

2ι(η(w)), we have
ρ(Ei)1 =

ρ(Ei)E = 0 ,
ρ(Ei)1 = 0 , ρ(Ei)Ej =

ρ(Ei)E =

where εij denotes the symplectic form on C2.22 To describe the spin representation, it
is enough to specify the action of M on S. Thus, for v = w+w ∈M, where w ∈W+,
22This is the natural bilinear pairing here, according to Proposition 5.3.14.

We know that the elements {˜ei˜ej}, with i < j, form a basis of the Lie algebra
spin(4, C). Rewriting this basis in terms of the elements Ei and Ej, one ﬁnds an
explicit matrix representation of spin(4, C) with respect to the bases {1, E} and
{E1, E2} in S+ and S−, respectively. From this representation one reads off that
spin(4, C) = sl(2, C) ⊕sl(2, C). Then, by Proposition 5.2.17
Spin(4, C) = SL(2, C) × SL(2, C) .
(5.3.38)
Finally, by Proposition 5.3.14, the bilinear form (5.3.36) should be anti-symmetric
and should induce anti-symmetric bilinear forms on both S+ and S−. This can be
checked by direct inspection. In the above bases, the bilinear forms on S± are given
by the standard anti-symmetric form εij with i, j = 1, 2.
♦
In the remainder of this section, we endow every spinor module with a natural
Hermitean bilinear form, discuss its relation to the canonical bilinear form (·, ·)SW
and draw important conclusions. We limit our attention to the Euclidean case and
comment on the pseudo-Euclidean case at the end.
Thus, let (V, q) be a positive-deﬁnite quadratic space with bilinear form η. Extend
η to VC and consider the natural Hermitean bilinear form h on VC associated with
the complex bilinear form η via
h(u, v) := η(u, v) ,
u, v ∈VC .
(5.3.39)
Here, v →v denotes the complex conjugation mapping. Clearly, this mapping
extends to a conjugate linear algebra automorphism a →a of Cl(V, q)c. Com-
bining this with the canonical anti-automorphism t, we obtain a conjugate linear
anti-automorphism
a∗:= t(a) ,
(5.3.40)
that is, (ab)∗= b∗a∗and (λa)∗= λa∗for λ ∈C. Let (E, ρ) be a complex rep-
resentation of Cl(V, q)c endowed with a Hermitean structure. It is called unitary
if
ρ(a∗) = ρ(a)∗
(5.3.41)
for all a ∈Cl(V, q)c. Thus, in particular, the generators v ∈V ⊂Cl(V, q)c act as
self-adjoint operators on E. Clearly, for a unitary Clifford module, the representations
of Spin(V) and Pin(V) preserve the Hermitean structure on E. Thus, they are unitary
as well.
We extend h to VC by setting h(φ, ψ) = 0 for φ, ψ ∈VC having a different
form degree and

(5.3.42)
where ui, vi ∈VC. Note that, with respect to the standard basis {eI} of VC induced
from an η-orthonormal basis {ei} of VC, h coincides with the standard Hermitean
form on Cn.
Example 5.3.16 We take up Example 5.3.2. Clearly, ⟨a, b⟩:= tr(a∗b) deﬁnes a
Hermitean inner product on Cl(V, q)c. Then, ⟨a, vb⟩= ⟨va, b⟩, for any v ∈V ⊂
Cl(V, q)c and a, b ∈Cl(V, q)c. Thus, endowed with the action by left multiplication,
Cl(V, q)c is a unitary Clifford module. Next, it is easy to see that the quantization
mapping intertwines the inner product on VC given by (5.3.42) with the above
inner product on Cl(V, q)c (Exercise 5.3.6). Thus, V is a unitary Clifford module
as well.
♦
Now, let dim V = 2k and let VC = W′ ⊕W ∼= W∗⊕W be a complex polarization.
Then, by (5.3.26), W and W′ are orthogonal with respect to h. Moreover, W = W′.
Thus, we can restrict h to W and to W′ and then extend these restrictions via (5.3.42)
to W and W′, respectively. This way, we obtain a scalar product hW on the spinor
module SW and, via W′ ∼= W∗, also a scalar product hW on SW.
Proposition 5.3.17 The spinor modules SW and SW are unitary. In particular, the
Hermitean forms hW and hW are Spin(V)-invariant.
Proof We write down the proof for SW. It is enough to show that any v ∈V acts via
ρW as a selfadjoint operator on W. Since v is real and W = W′, with respect to the
chosen complex polarization it decomposes as v = w + w, where w ∈W. We prove
ι(η(w))∗= ε(w) ,
ε(w)∗= ι(η(w)) .
On the one hand, for any φ = u1∧. . .∧uk ∈kW and ψ = v1∧. . .∧vk+1 ∈k+1W,
hW(ι(η(w))∗φ, ψ) = h(u1 ∧. . . ∧uk, ι(η(w))(v1 ∧. . . ∧vk+1))

On the other hand, hW(ε(w)φ, ψ) = hW(w ∧u1 ∧. . . ∧uk, v1 ∧. . . ∧vk+1). Using
(5.3.42) and expanding the determinant with respect to the ﬁrst line, we obtain the
assertion. Now, ρW(v)∗=

5.3 Representations
389
Proposition 5.3.18 Let dim V = 2k and let VC = W∗⊕W be a complex polar-
ization. Then, the scalar product hW on SW and the canonical bilinear form (·, ·)SW
are compatible, that is, there exists an anti-linear Spin(V)-equivariant mapping
C : SW →SW such that
hW(C(eI), eJ) = (eI, eJ)SW .
(5.3.43)
If the canonical bilinear form is symmetric, then C2 = id. If it is anti-symmetric,
then C2 = −id. The corresponding statements are true for SW.
Proof We have
(eI, eIc)SW = εI ,
(5.3.44)
where εI = ±1. If (·, ·)SW is symmetric, then εI = εIc. If it is anti-symmetric, then
εI = −εIc. Now, since both hW and (·, ·)SW are non-degenerate, (5.3.43) deﬁnes
an anti-linear isomorphism C : SW →SW. Moreover, since SW is unitary and
since (·, ·)SW is Spin(n)-invariant, C is Spin(V)-equivariant. Comparing (5.3.43)
with (5.3.44), we read off
C(eI) = εI eIc .
(5.3.45)
This implies C2 = id in the symmetric case and C2 = −id in the anti-symmetric
case.
■
Now, recall some basic terminology from representation theory. Let S be a Hermitean
vectorspacecarryingaunitaryrepresentationofacompactLiegroupG.Ifthereexists
an anti-linear G-equivariant mapping C : S →S fulﬁlling C2 = id or C2 = −id,
thenS issaidtobeofrealorofquaternionictype,respectively.C iscalledthestructure
mapping. In the ﬁrst case, S is the complexiﬁcation of the real G-representation SR
given as the ﬁxed point set of C. In the second case, C induces on S the structure of
a quaternionic G-representation with scalar multiplication by the quaternions i, j, k
given by i = i, j = C and k = ij. In both cases, C clearly provides an isomorphism
of S and the dual module S∗. Consequently, such representations are referred to as
self-dual. If a unitary G-representation is not self-dual, then it is said to be of complex
type.
Combining Proposition 5.3.18 with Proposition 5.3.14, we obtain the following.
Theorem 5.3.19 We have the following types of the spin representations of Spin(n):
n = 0 mod 8 : Δ±
n of real type ,
n = 2, 6 mod 8 : Δ±
n of complex type ,
n = 4 mod 8 : Δ±
n of quaternionic type ,
n = 1, 7 mod 8 : Δn of real type ,
n = 3, 5 mod 8 : Δn of quaternionic type .
Proof The ﬁrst three assertions are immediate from Propositions 5.3.14 and 5.3.18.
Consider the case n = 2k −1 with k even. Then, by (5.3.17), Δn ∼= Δ+
n+1 and the
restriction of the bilinear form yields a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form for

390
5
Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
k = 0 (mod 4) and an anti-symmetric bilinear form for k = 2 (mod 4), respectively.
Finally, let n = 2k −1 with k odd. Then, according to Proposition 5.3.14, the rest-
riction of the canonical bilinear form to Δ+
n+1 vanishes. But instead one can take the
Spin(n)-invariant bilinear form
(φ, ψ) := (φ, ρ(en+1)ψ)SW ,
φ, ψ ∈Δ2k−1 = Δ2(k−1) ,
which is easily seen to be symmetric for k = 1 (mod 4) and anti-symmetric for
k = 3 (mod 4), respectively.
■
Remark 5.3.20 (Structure mapping) Recall the explicit k-fold tensor product repre-
sentation
Δ2k = C2k = C2 ⊗. . . ⊗C2
given by (5.3.2), together with the explicit presentation of the generators e1 and e2
of the spinor representation on C2,
e1 =
0 1
1 0

,
e2 =
1 0
0 −1

,
provided in Example 5.1.13. Using this, from (5.3.45) one can read off the structure
mapping C explicitly. Consider the case n = 8k + 4. Then, by Theorem 5.3.19, both
Δ±
n are of quaternionic type. For n = 4, we have Δ+
4 = C2 = Δ−
4 and Δ+
4 and Δ−
4
are spanned by (e∅, e{1,2}) and (e{1}, e{2}), respectively. Taking into account that C
must be anti-linear, for Δ4 = C2 ⊗C2, formula (5.3.45) yields:
C : C2 ⊗C2 →C2 ⊗C2 ,

(5.3.46)
Then, C2 = −id, indeed. Moreover, using the explicit presentation of the Clifford
multiplication on Δ4 found in the proof of Proposition 5.1.15,
f1 = 1 ⊗e1 ,
f2 = 1 ⊗e2 ,
f3 = e1 ⊗i e1e2 ,
f4 = e2 ⊗i e1e2 ,
one checks by direct inspection (Exercise 5.3.7) that C commutes with the Clifford
action,
C ◦fi = fi ◦C ,
i = 1, 2, 3, 4 .
(5.3.47)
This implies that C is equivariant with respect to the spin representation.23 Using the
above tensor product decomposition of Δ2k, this construction may be easily extended
to n = 8k + 4 yielding a quaternionic structure mapping C commuting with the
Clifford multiplication. In a completely analogous way, the structure mappings of
23We know this already from Proposition 5.3.18.

5.3 Representations

the remaining cases provided by Theorem 5.3.19 may be constructed. For a complete
list, we refer e.g. to [219].24
♦
Remark 5.3.21 (Majorana spinors) Let S be a complex spin representation. Then, S
is called Majorana (resp. symplectic Majorana) if it admits a real (resp. quaternionic)
structure mapping C. A spinor φ ∈S is called Majorana if C(φ) = φ. We refer to
[633] for more details.
♦
Example 5.3.22 (Low-dimensional spin groups) Recall Example 5.2.11. Here, we
show that Theorem 5.3.19 yields elegant proofs of the isomorphisms between low-
dimensional spin groups and classical Lie groups. We illustrate this by proving
Spin(5) ∼= Sp(2) ,
Spin(6) ∼= SU(4) .
Since Δ5 is a faithful 4-dimensional representation of quaternionic type, after iden-
tifying C4 ∼= H2, we obtain an injective homomorphism ϕ : Spin(5) →Sp(2).
By dimension counting, this must be an isomorphism. Next, Δ6 is of complex type
and decomposes into irreducible 4-dimensional representations, Δ6 = Δ+
6 ⊕Δ−
6 .
Thus, since the spin representation is unitary, we obtain injective homomorphisms
ϕ± : Spin(6) →U(4). Since Spin(6) is the covering group of a simple Lie group, it
must be semisimple. Thus, its image under ϕ± must lie in SU(4). Again, by dimension
counting, we conclude that ϕ± are isomorphisms.
♦
An analysis similar to that in Theorem 5.3.19 has also been carried out for the pseudo-
Euclidean case, see [15, 286] for a detailed presentation. Here, we focus on the con-
struction of a Spin(V)-invariant Hermitean form on the spinor module.25 Given this
form, one can then proceed as in the positive-deﬁnite case. Recall from Proposition
5.3.17 that, for a positive-deﬁnite η, the Hermitean forms on the spinor modules are
Spin(V)-invariant. In the pseudo-Euclidean case, the situation is more complicated.
It can be shown that, here, there does not exist a positive deﬁnite Spin(V)-invariant
Hermitean form at all. In particular, the canonical Hermitean form on the spinor
module is only invariant with respect to the maximal compact subgroup of the spin
group, see [59] for details. There exists, however, an indeﬁnite invariant Hermitean
form, deﬁned as follows.
Take the canonical (positive-deﬁnite) Hermitean form
h(φ, ψ) := φ†ψ ,
φ, ψ ∈Δr,s ,
(5.3.48)
on Δr+s ∼= C2k, where r + s = 2k. Let {ei} be an orthonormal basis in Rr,s. Any
vector x ∈Rr,s may be decomposed as x = x+ + x−, where x+ ∈span {e1, . . . , er}
and x−∈span {er+1, . . . , er+s}. By the explicit presentation of the Clifford action
provided in Remark 5.1.20, we have γ (ej)† = ηjjγ (ej) for all j = 1, . . . , n. Thus,
24Note, however, the different conventions there.
25The Spin(V)-invariance is relevant for applications in geometry and physics. In particular, one
wants to construct Spin(V)-invariant Lagrangians for ﬁeld theoretical models.

h(x+ · φ, ψ) = h(φ, x+ · ψ) ,
h(x−· φ, ψ) = −h(φ, x−· ψ) .

We deﬁne
Γr =

 e1 · e2 · . . . · er
if r = 0, 1 (mod 4)
i e1 · e2 · . . . · er if r = 2, 3 (mod 4)
(5.3.50)
Then, Γ 2
r = 1 and x+ · Γr = (−1)r−1Γr · x+ and x−· Γr = (−1)rΓr · x−. Thus,
h(Γr · φ, ψ) = h(φ, Γr · ψ) ,
(5.3.51)
for any φ, ψ ∈Δr+s. Now, we can deﬁne a modiﬁed Hermitean form:
hΔ(φ, ψ) := h(Γr · φ, ψ) ,
φ, ψ ∈Δr,s .
(5.3.52)
Proposition 5.3.23 The bilinear form hΔ has the following properties.
1. It deﬁnes an indeﬁnite Hermitean form of index 2k−1.
2. It is Spinr,s-invariant.
3. For any x ∈Rn and any φ, ψ ∈Δr,s,
hΔ(x · φ, ψ) + (−1)rhΔ(φ, x · ψ) = 0 .
(5.3.53)
Proof The matrix γ (Γr) is non-singular and has 2k−1 positive and 2k−1 negative
eigenvalues. Moreover, by (5.3.51),
hΔ(φ, ψ) = h(Γr · φ, ψ) = h(ψ, Γr · φ) = h(Γr · ψ, φ) = hΔ(ψ, φ) .
This proves the ﬁrst assertion. Next, take any x ∈Rn and decompose x = x+ + x−.
Then, using (5.3.49), we calculate
hΔ(x · φ, ψ) = h(Γr · x · φ, ψ)
= h(Γr · x+ · φ, ψ) + h(Γr · x−· φ, ψ)
= (−1)r−1h(x+ · Γr · φ, ψ) + (−1)rh(x−· Γr · φ, ψ)
= (−1)r−1h(Γr · φ, x · ψ)
= (−1)r−1hΔ(φ, x · ψ) .
This proves the third assertion. Finally, let g = x1 · . . . · x2m ∈Spinr,s. Then, using
(5.3.53) together with N(g) = 1, we obtain
hΔ(g · φ, g · ψ) = (−1)2rm hΔ(φ, ψ) = hΔ(φ, ψ) .

Spin Structures and Spinc-Structures
Now, we consider a real orientable n-dimensional Riemannian vector bundle π :
E →M. Recall from Corollary 4.8.4 that E is orientable iff w1(E) = 0. Moreover, if
w1(E) = 0, then the distinct orientations on E are in one-to-one correspondence with
elements of H0
Z2(M). By Example 1.6.6, the associated frame bundle of E may be
reduced to the bundle of orthonormal frames O(E) and every choice of an orientation
yields a further reduction to the bundle of oriented orthonormal frames O+(E). By
Corollary 5.2.8, there is an exact sequence

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
1 →Z2
j→Spin(n)
λ→SO(n) →1 .
(5.4.1)
Thus, we have a covering homomorphism λ : Spin(n) →SO(n) with kernel Z2. By
Remark 5.2.9, the latter is universal for n > 2.
Deﬁnition 5.4.1 (Spin structure) Let π : E →M be a real orientable n-dimensional
Riemannian vector bundle with n > 2. Then, a spin structure on E is a pair (S(E), Λ),
where S(E) is a principal Spin(n)-bundle over M and Λ : S(E) →O+(E), together
with λ, is a vertical bundle morphism.
Two spin structures (S1(E), Λ1) and (S2(E), Λ2) are called equivalent if there
exists a Spin(n)-equivariant mapping F : S1(E) →S2(E) fulﬁlling Λ2 ◦F = Λ1.
Note that, by (5.4.1), Λ is a two-sheeted covering.
By Example 5.2.11, Spin(2) ∼= U(1). Thus, for n = 2, we take for λ : U(1) →
U(1) the connected two-fold covering. For n = 1, a spin structure is deﬁned as a
two-fold covering of M.
Remark 5.4.2 In the terminology of Sect.2.2, a spin structure is yet another example
of an H-structure. In the terminology of Sect.1.6, O+(E) is a λ-extension of S(E),
or, since λ is surjective, S(E) is a Spin(n)-extension of O+(E). We have
O+(E) = S(E) ×Spin(n) SO(n) ,
(5.4.2)
or, on the level of vector bundles,
E ∼= O+(E) ×SO(n) Rn ∼= S(E) ×Spin(n) Rn .
(5.4.3)
This yields an equivalent deﬁnition of a spin structure: a spin structure on E is a
pair (S(E), ϕ), where S(E) is a principal Spin(n)-bundle over M and
ϕ : E →S(E) ×Spin(n) Rn
is an isomorphism of oriented Riemannian vector bundles.
♦
Let us discuss the question of existence and uniqueness of spin structures.
Theorem 5.4.3 Let π : E →M be a real oriented Riemannian vector bundle. Then,
there exists a spin structure on E iff the second Stiefel-Whitney class w2(E) vanishes.
Moreover, if w2(E) = 0, then the isomorphism classes of spin structures on E are in
one-to-one correspondence with the elements of H1
Z2(M).
Proof By Proposition 3.7.5, the exact sequence (5.4.1) induces a ﬁbration of classi-
fying spaces,
BZ2
Bj
−→BSpin(n)
Bλ
−→BSO(n) .
(5.4.4)
By Appendix G, BZ2 coincides with the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z2, 1) and
thus, by the discussion in Sect.4.8, the ﬁbration (5.4.4) implies the sequence

K(Z2, 1)
Bj
−→BSpin(n)
Bλ
−→BSO(n)
θ
−→K(Z2, 2) .
(5.4.5)
Using Corollary 3.6.9 and [M, K(Z2, n)] = Hn
Z2(M), we derive from (5.4.5) the
following exact sequence of pointed sets:
. . . −→[M, Spin(n)]
λ∗
−→[M, SO(n)]
Ωθ∗
−→H1
Z2(M)
Bj∗
−→[M, BSpin(n)]
Bλ∗
−→[M, BSO(n)]
θ∗
−→H2
Z2(M) .
(5.4.6)
Now, a principal SO(n)-bundle P admits a 2-fold covering by a principal Spin(n)-
bundle iff it is contained in the image of Bλ∗, that is, according to the exactness of
this sequence iff θ∗(P) = 0. But, by deﬁnition of the Stiefel-Whitney classes, we
have
θ∗(P) = w2(P) .
The second statement also follows from the exactness of the sequence (5.4.6).
■
The most important special case is provided by the choice E = TM.
Deﬁnition 5.4.4 (Spin manifold) A spin manifold is an oriented Riemannian mani-
fold with a spin structure on its tangent bundle.
Since the Stiefel-Whitney classes of a manifold M are, by deﬁnition, the Stiefel-
Whitney classes of TM, Theorem 5.4.3 implies the following.
Corollary 5.4.5 An oriented Riemannian manifold M admits a spin structure iff its
second Stiefel-Whitney class w2(M) vanishes. Moreover, if w2(M) = 0, then the
isomorphism classes of spin structures on M are in one-to-one correspondence with
the elements of H1
Z2(M).
■
Remark 5.4.6 Let L+(M) be the bundle of oriented linear frames of M. We show that,
for any Riemannian metric on M, the manifolds O+(M) and L+(M) are homotopy
equivalent. For that purpose, let j : O+(M) →L+(M) be the natural inclusion
mapping and let p : L+(M) →O+(M) be deﬁned by the standard orthonormalization
procedure of linear frames. Then, clearly p ◦j = idO+(M). Since, for any u ∈L+(M),
the image j ◦p(u) is obtained from u by a transformation from GL+(Rn) and, since
GL+(Rn) is connected, we conclude that j ◦p is homotopic to the identity on L+(M).
This implies that the choice of a spin structure for a given Riemannian metric uniquely
determines a spin structure for any other Riemannian metric. In this sense, a spin
structure does not depend on the choice of the Riemannian metric.
♦
Remark 5.4.7 (Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds) If (M, g) is a pseudo-Riemannian
manifold with signature (r, s), then one has the following existence criterion, see
[59] and further references therein: let TM = Er ⊕Es be a decomposition of
TM into a time-like (positive deﬁnite) subbundle Er and an orthogonal space-
like (negative deﬁnite) subbundle Es. The manifold M admits a spin structure iff
w2(M) = w1(Er) ∪w1(Es). In particular, a time- or a space-orientable pseudo-
Riemannian manifold admits a spin structure if its second Stiefel-Whitney class
vanishes. The spin structures are classiﬁed by the group H1
Z2(M). We refer the

reader to [59] for a discussion of special classes of examples important in geom-
etry and physics.
♦
We continue with a number of examples.
Example 5.4.8 (2-connected manifolds) If M is 2-connected, then the Hurewicz
Theorem, together with the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem, implies that H1
Z2(M) and
H2
Z2(M) vanish. Thus, M carries a unique spin structure. Examples of this type are
spheres of dimension n > 2, simply connected Lie groups and the Stiefel manifolds
SK(k, l) of k-frames in Kl fulﬁlling d(l −k + 1) ≥4, see Theorem 3.4.10. Here, d
is the dimension of K over R.
♦
Example 5.4.9 (Spin Structure of S4) Consider M = S4 which ﬁts into the class
of manifolds described by Example 5.4.8. Let us calculate the spin structure S(S4)
explicitly. By Example 5.2.11, we have Spin(4) = Sp(1) × Sp(1) and Spin(5) =
Sp(2). Thus, we obtain the following commutative diagram:

Here, λ and λ′ are the covering homomorphisms and i and i′ denote the natural
inclusion homomorphisms. Next, recall from Example 1.1.24 and Remark 1.1.25
that
S4 ∼= SR(1, 5) ∼= SO(5)/SO(4)
(5.4.7)
and
HP1 ∼= GH(1, 2) ∼= Sp(2)/(Sp(1) × Sp(1)) .
(5.4.8)
By Example 1.1.18, the bundle of oriented orthonormal frames O+(S4) coincides
with the principal SO(4)-bundle SO(5) →SO(5)/SO(4) and, by (5.4.8), Sp(2)
carries the structure of a principal (Sp(1) × Sp(1))-bundle over S4. Thus, the pair
(λ′, λ) of Lie group homomorphisms deﬁnes a morphism of principal bundles:

Since λ′ is a 2-fold covering, we conclude that Sp(2), viewed as a principal (Sp(1)×

Example 5.4.10 (Projective spaces) Consider the n-dimensional projective space
KPn for K = R, C or H. Then,

1. RPn is spin iff n = 3 (mod 4).
2. CPn is spin iff n is odd.
3. HPn is spin for all n.
In case 1 we have two spin structures and in the remaining cases the spin structures
are unique. By Example 4.5.3, the total Stiefel-Whitney class of KPn is
w = 1 + w1 + w2 + . . . = (1 + ξ)n+1 ,
where ξ is the generator of the Z2-cohomology ring. This generator has degree 1,
2 and 4 for, respectively, K = R, C and H. Now, one has to analyze the conditions
w1 = 0 and w2 = 0 for each case. For K = R, they are equivalent to w1 = (n + 1)ξ
and w2 =

ξ 2 = 0, that is,
(n + 1) = 0 (mod 2) ,

Moreover, H1
Z2(RPn) is generated by ξ. This yields the assertion. For K = C or H,
the proof is obvious.
In special cases, one can give a proof by simple geometric arguments, see e.g.
Proposition 3.3 in [554] where it is shown that CP2 cannot carry a spin structure. ♦
Example 5.4.11 Let (M, g) be an oriented 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold.
Consider the Hodge decomposition
2T∗M = 2

see (2.8.17). Since 2
+R4 ∼= so(3) = spin(3), the subbundles E± = 2
±TM are
Riemannian with the ﬁbre metric induced from the Killing form on so(3). Let O(E±)
be the principal SO(3)-bundles of (positive or negative) orthonormal frames of E±
and let S(E±) be the corresponding spin bundles. It is easy to show (Exercise 5.4.1)
that
E± ∼= Ad(S(E±)) .
(5.4.9)
♦
Example 5.4.12 (Compact Riemann surfaces) For a compact Riemann surface of
genus g, there are exactly 22g distinct spin structures. We refer to [407] for their
explicit construction.
♦
Example 5.4.13 Any complex manifold M is orientable, because the realiﬁcation of
a complex vector bundle is orientable, see Sect.4.2. Moreover, by Corollary 4.4.7/1,
w2(M) is the mod 2-reduction of the ﬁrst Chern class c1(M). Thus, a complex man-
ifold is spin iff c1(M) = 0(mod 2).
♦
Since a spin structure is a principal bundle, the ordinary theory of connections
as developed in Chap.1 applies. Since Λ : S(M) →O+(M) is a covering, any

Uniqueness follows from the fact that dλ is an isomorphism of Lie algebras. Explic-

(5.4.10)
On the other hand, according to Corollary 1.3.14, any connection in S(M) induces a
unique connection in O+(M).
Deﬁnition 5.4.14 Let (M, g) be an oriented Riemannian spin manifold and let
(S(M), Λ) be a chosen spin structure on M. Let ω be the Levi-Civita connection
of g viewed as a principal connection on O+(M). Then, the unique lift ˆω deﬁned by
(5.4.10) will be referred to as the spin connection on S(M).
Finally, we show that the notion of a spin structure extends to the notion of a Spinc-
structure in an obvious way. Let
λ := pr1 ◦p : Spinc(n) →SO(n) ,
σ := pr2 ◦p : Spinc(n) →U(1) ,
be the natural homomorphisms deﬁned by the sequence (5.2.17).
Deﬁnition 5.4.15 (Spinc-structure) Let π : E →M be a real orientable n-dimensio-
nal Riemannian vector bundle with n > 2. Then, a Spinc-structure on E is a pair
(Sc(E), Λ), where Sc(E) is a principal Spinc(n)-bundle over M and Λ : Sc(E) →
O+(E), together with λ, is a vertical principal bundle morphism.
Clearly, by the above deﬁnition, since U(1) and Spin(n) are Lie subgroups of
Spinc(n), we have
(a) Sc(E) factorised with respect to the natural right U(1)-action is isomorphic to
O+(E).
(b) Sc(E) factorised with respect to the natural right Spin(n)-action is a principal
U(1)-ﬁbre bundle over M which we denote by P.
(c) We have a two-fold covering Sc(E) →O+(E) ×M P, where O+(E) ×M P is the
ﬁbre product26 of principal bundles over M with structure group SO(n) × U(1).
Associated with P, we have a complex line bundle
L := P ×σ C
(5.4.11)
26Cf. Remark 1.1.9/2.

5.4 Spin Structures and Spinc-Structures
399
which is referred to as the fundamental (or determinant) line bundle of the Spinc-
structure. As in Remark 5.4.2, on the level of vector bundles, we have
E ∼= O+(E) ×SO(n) Rn ∼= Sc(E) ×Spinc(n) Rn .
Thus, as before, identifying U(1) ∼= SO(2) and considering the natural embedding
i : SO(n) × SO(2) →SO(n +2) induced from the decomposition Rn+2 = Rn ⊕R2,
we obtain
E ⊕L ∼= Sc(E) ×i◦p (Rn ⊕R2) .
(5.4.12)
Now, by the commutative diagram (5.2.22), we have the following.
Proposition 5.4.16 AnorientedRiemannianvectorbundleE overM admitsaSpinc-
structure iff there exists a complex line bundle L over M such that E ⊕L admits a
spin structure.
Using this criterion, it is easy to discuss the obstruction against the existence of a
Spinc-structure.
Proposition 5.4.17 An oriented Riemannian vector bundle E admits a Spinc-struc-
ture iff its second Stiefel-Whitney class w2(E) is the mod 2 reduction of a cohomology
class from H2
Z(M).
Proof By Proposition 5.4.16 and Theorem 5.4.3, E admits a Spinc-structure iff there
exist a line bundle L such that w2(E ⊕L) = 0, that is, by the Whitney Sum Formula,
iff
w2(E ⊕L) = w2(E) + w2(L) + w1(E)w1(L) = 0 .
Since E and L are oriented, we conclude w2(E) + w2(L) = 0. Since these are mod
2 classes, this implies
w2(E) = w2(L) .
But, w2(L) is the mod 2 reduction of c1(L). This proves the assertion in one direction.
Conversely, if w2(E) is the mod 2 reduction of an integral cohomology class α, then
we can ﬁnd a complex line bundle L with ﬁrst Chern class α.
■
Let Spinc(E) be the set of Spinc-structures on E. By assigning to a Spinc-structure
the ﬁrst Chern class of P, we obtain a mapping
Spinc(E) →H2
Z(M) .
It can be shown [219] that the Spinc-structures of E are classiﬁed by H2
Z(M).

Example 5.4.18 Notethatviathenaturalinclusionmappingι : Spin(n) →Spinc(n),
every spin structure S(E) induces a Spinc-structure of E. The latter is obtained by
taking the ﬁbre product with the trivial principal U(1)-bundle P0,
Sc(E) = S(E) ×M P0 .
♦
Example 5.4.19 Assume that E admits a complex structure, that is, O+(E) admits
a U(k)-reduction Q. Then, by Proposition 5.2.14, there exists a homomorphism
F : U(k) →Spinc(2k) projecting onto SO(2k) × U(1). Thus,
Sc(E) := Q ×U(k) Spinc(2k)
is a Spinc-structure of E.
♦
Clearly, the most important example is E = TM.
Deﬁnition 5.4.20 (Spinc-manifold) Let M be an oriented Riemannian manifold. If
TM admits a Spinc-structure, then M is called a Spinc-manifold.
By Example 5.4.18, every spin manifold has a canonical Spinc-structure and, by
Example 5.4.19, every almost complex manifold has a canonical Spinc-structure,
too. The following deep theorem holds [305, 681].
Theorem 5.4.21 (Wu-Hirzebruch-Hopf) Every compact orientable 4-dimensional
manifold is Spinc.
As in the case of a spin structure, the ordinary theory of connections applies here. For
a given Spinc(n)-structure Sc(E) on E, a connection form ω on Sc(E) takes values
in the Lie algebra
spinc(n) = spin(n) ⊕iR ∼= so(n) ⊕iR .
Let there be given connection forms on O+(E) and P, respectively. Then, by Remark
1.3.17, they induce a connection form on the ﬁbre product O+(E) ×M P and, since
Sc(E) →O+(E) ×M P is a covering, the latter lifts to a unique connection form on
Sc(E). Conversely, given a connection form on Sc(E), it induces connection forms
on O+(E) and P, respectively.

Clifford Modules and Dirac Operators
We introduce a variety of vector bundle structures associated with Clifford modules
and, in particular, with spinor modules. These structures can be deﬁned for arbitrary
pseudo-Riemannian vector bundles E →M, but in applications in geometry and

5.5 Clifford Modules and Dirac Operators
401
physics the special case E = TM with M being a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is
the most important one. We rather focus on the Riemannian case.
First,observethatthebasicrepresentationofSO(n)ontheEuclideanspace(Rn, q)
induces an action of SO(n) by algebra homomorphisms on the tensor algebra over
Rn which leaves the ideal Iq(Rn) deﬁned in Sect.5.1 invariant. Thus, we obtain a
representation of SO(n) on the Clifford algebra Cln by algebra homomorphisms:
ρn : SO(n) →Aut(Cln) .
(5.5.1)
Deﬁnition 5.5.1 (Clifford bundle) Let E be an oriented Riemannian vector bundle
of rank n and let O+(E) be the bundle of oriented orthonormal frames. Then, the
associated algebra bundle
Cl(E) := O+(E) ×ρn Cln
(5.5.2)
will be referred to as the Clifford bundle of E. For an oriented Riemannian manifold
(M, g), the bundle Cl(TM) will be called the Clifford bundle of M. It will be denoted
by Cl(M).
By analogy, one deﬁnes the Clifford bundle of a Hermitean vector bundle using the
extension of ρn to Clc
n. For example, we can take the complexiﬁcation
Clc(E) = Cl(E) ⊗C = O+(E) ×ρn Clc
n .
(5.5.3)
Below, we will often not distinguish in notation between Cl(E) and Clc(E) and just
write Cl(E) for both.
Note that Cl(E) is a bundle of Clifford algebras over M. In particular, the ﬁbrewise
multiplication in Cl(E) provides the space of sections of Cl(E) with a natural algebra
structure. It follows that all Clifford algebra operations carry over to Clifford bundles.
In particular, the parity automorphism induces a vertical bundle automorphism of
Cl(E) and, thus, we obtain a decomposition
Cl(E) = Cl0(E) ⊕Cl1(E)
(5.5.4)
corresponding to (5.1.5). Moreover, the vector space isomorphism given by Propo-
sition 5.1.10 induces an vector bundle isomorphism
E ∼= Cl(E) .
(5.5.5)
Second, we consider bundles of modules over the Clifford bundle, that is, for a
given Riemannian (or Hermitean) vector bundle E →M, the ﬁbre at m ∈M of
such a bundle is a left module over Cl(Em). In particular, for E = TM, the ﬁbre
at m is a left module over Cl(TmM). Such bundles will be referred to as Clifford
module bundles. We give the deﬁnition for the case E = TM. The generalization to
an arbitrary Riemannian (or Hermitean) vector bundle will then be obvious.

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Deﬁnition 5.5.2 (Clifford module bundle over Cl(M)) Let (M, g) be a Riemannian
manifold and let E →M be a real (or complex) vector bundle. If there exists a
mapping c : TM →End(E ) fulﬁlling
c(X)2 = g(X, X) idEm
(5.5.6)
for every X ∈TmM, then c is referred to as a Clifford mapping and E as a Clifford
module bundle over Cl(M).
By the universal property, since TM ⊂Cl(M) generates Cl(M) ﬁbrewise, c induces
a unique homomorphism
ˆc : Cl(M) →End(E )
(5.5.7)
of algebra bundles fulﬁlling ˆc(X) = c(X) for any X ∈TmM. This justiﬁes the
terminology.
The special case when the typical ﬁbre of a complex Clifford module bundle E
coincides with a spinor module Δn is of particular importance. Such a bundle will
be referred to as a spinor bundle over Cl(M). Let us assume that the Riemannian
manifold (M, g) admits a spin structure (S(M), Λ). Then, we have a canonically
associated bundle,
S (M) := S(M) ×γ Δn ,
(5.5.8)
where γ denotes the spinor representation.
Deﬁnition 5.5.3 (Spinor bundle) The vector bundle S (M) will be referred to as
the spinor bundle of (M, g) relative to the ﬁxed spin structure S(M).
In the sequel, S (M) will also be called the canonical spinor bundle. The general-
ization to a Hermitean vector bundle carrying a spin structure is obvious. Clearly,
S (M) is a Clifford module bundle with the Clifford mapping given by the spinor
representation γ . This follows from the fact that (Exercise 5.5.1)
Cl(M) ∼= S(M) ×Spin(n) Cln
(5.5.9)
with the action of Spin(n) on Cln given by conjugation,
Ad : Spin(n) × Cln →Cln ,
Ad(g)a := gag−1 .
Now, the spinor representation of Cln on Δn induces a ﬁbrewise action of the associ-
ated bundle Cl(M) ∼= S(M) ×Spin(n) Cln on S (M). Note that Remark 5.3.3 implies
the following.
Remark 5.5.4 Let E be a complex Clifford module bundle. Then, the isomorphism
(5.3.6) implies
End(E ) ∼= Clc(M) ⊗EndCl(M)(E ) .
(5.5.10)

5.5 Clifford Modules and Dirac Operators
403
Moreover, since locally every Riemannian manifold admits a spin structure, (5.3.5)
implies the following local structure for any Clifford module bundle E :
E↾U ∼= S (U) ⊗W ,
(5.5.11)
where U ⊂M is an open subset, S (U) is the spinor bundle with respect to a chosen
spin structure on U and W = HomCl(M)(S (U), E ). If (M, g) admits a spin structure,
then (5.5.11) holds globally.
♦
According to (5.3.15), for n = 2k, S (M) splits into a direct sum of subbundles,
S (M) = S +(M) ⊕S −(M) ,
S ±(M) = S(M) ×γ Δ±
n .
Remark 5.5.5 Let n = 2k. By point 2 of Proposition 5.3.11, the Clifford multi-
plication with any non-vanishing vector x ∈Rn yields vector space isomorphisms
Δ±
n →Δ∓
n . This implies that the Clifford mapping c is odd, that is, for any X ∈TmM,
we have a bundle isomorphism c(X) : S ±(M) →S ∓(M).
♦
Remark 5.5.6 By Remark 5.3.8, in a completely analogous way, we may consider
the Spinc(n)-representation on Δn given by (5.3.20). Thus, we can build the spinor
bundle
S c(M) := Sc(M) ×Spinc(n) Δn
(5.5.12)
with respect to a ﬁxed Spinc-structure. Moreover, if n is even, then we have a natural
splitting
S c(M) = S c
+(M) ⊕S c
−(M)
(5.5.13)
corresponding to the spinor module splitting Δn = Δ+
n ⊕Δ−
n . Many considerations
in the sequel, spelled out for S (M), hold true for that case as well.
♦
Remark 5.5.7 (Projective spinor bundle) In 4-dimensional Riemannian geometry,
the projectivization of spinor bundles plays an important role. Let M be an oriented
4-dimensional spin manifold. Consider the irreducible spinor modules Δ±
4 ∼= C2 of
Spin(4). Then, for the corresponding projective spaces P(Δ±
4 ) we have
P(Δ±
4 ) ∼= CP1 ∼= Sp(1)/U(1) .
(5.5.14)
Thus, Spin(4) ∼= Sp(1) × Sp(1) acts naturally on P(Δ±
4 ). Indeed, denoting by λ∓:
Sp(1)×Sp(1) →Sp(1) the Lie group homomorphisms given by projection onto the
ﬁrst and second component, respectively, we deﬁne the left actions
σ∓: (Sp(1) × Sp(1)) × (Sp(1)/U(1)) →Sp(1)/U(1) ,
σ∓(h)([g]) := [λ∓(h)g] .
Consequently, we can build the associated projective spinor bundles
P±(M) := S(M) ×σ± P(Δ±
4 ) .
(5.5.15)

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
In particular, by Example 5.4.9, S(S4) = Sp(2), where Sp(2) is viewed as a principal
(Sp(1)×Sp(1))-bundle over S4. Then, using (5.5.14), we obtain P±(S4) = Sp(2)×σ±
Sp(1)/U(1) and, thus,
P+(S4) ∼= Sp(2)/(Sp(1) × U(1)) ,
P−(S4) = Sp(2)/(U(1) × Sp(1)) .
(5.5.16)
♦
Remark 5.5.8 Let M be an oriented 4-dimensional spin manifold endowed with a
conformal structure.27 We show that P±(M) carry natural almost complex structures.
Since the Clifford multiplication with any non-vanishing vector of Rn yields vector
space isomorphisms Δ±
4 →Δ∓
4 , for any non-zero spinor φ ∈S −(M)m at a point
m ∈M, the Clifford multiplication X →X · φ with X ∈TmM yields a real vector
space isomorphism TmM ∼= S +(M)m which endows TmM with a complex structure.
It can be easily seen that the latter is compatible with any metric from the conformal
class and that it induces an orientation on TmM which is opposite to the chosen
orientation of M, see [218] for a detailed proof. Clearly, by multiplying φ with a
nonvanishing complex number, we obtain the same complex structure, that is, the
complex structures constructed this way are parameterized by the projective spaces
P−(M)m. Since the stabilizer of [φ] ∈P−(M)m is clearly U(1) × Sp(1), we get
P−(M)m ∼= (Sp(1) × Sp(1))/(U(1) × Sp(1)) ∼= SO(4)/U(2) .
Let us ﬁx a Riemannian metric in the conformal class. Then, the spin connection
of this metric yields a splitting of TP−(M) into the vertical distribution V and a
horizontal complement Γ ,
TP−(M) = V ⊕Γ .
Now, we can endow P−(M) with an almost complex structure as follows. On V we
take the natural complex structures of the ﬁbres which are complex projective lines.
On the horizontal part Γ at the point [φ] ∈P−(M)m we take the complex structure
of TmM constructed above.
It can be shown that the almost complex structure on P−(M) constructed in this
way is integrable iff M is self-dual, see Theorem 4.1 in [37]. Moreover, one can
show that conformally equivalent metrics yield the same complex structure. For our
purposes, the most important example is M = S4 which is clearly self-dual, cf.
Example 2.8.10.
Obviously, P+(M) may be discussed in a similar manner.
♦
In applications, Clifford module bundles are usually endowed with additional struc-
tures. These will be explained next.
27The assumption that M be spin can be dropped, see [37].

5.5 Clifford Modules and Dirac Operators
405
Deﬁnition 5.5.9 Let E
→M be a real (or complex) Clifford module bundle
endowed with a Riemannian (or Hermitean) ﬁbre metric h. If the Clifford mapping
c : TM →End(E ) maps every X ∈TM to a self-adjoint endomorphism,28
h(Φ, c(X)Ψ ) = h(c(X)Φ, Ψ )
(5.5.17)
for any Φ, Ψ ∈Em and any X ∈TmM, then E will be referred to as a Riemannian
(or Hermitean) Clifford module bundle. It will be denoted by (E , h).
In the sequel, it will be often convenient to write ⟨·, ·⟩instead of h.
Consider the case E = S (M). If we take the Hermitean ﬁbre metric induced
from the canonical (positive-deﬁnite) Hermitean form29
h(φ, ψ) := φ†ψ ,
φ, ψ ∈Δn ,
(5.5.18)
then, by (5.3.49), we have h(x · φ, ψ) = h(φ, x · ψ) and, thus, the condition (5.5.17)
is fulﬁlled.
Finally,weconsiderRiemannian(orHermitean)Cliffordmodulebundlesendowed
with a connection compatible with the ﬁbre metric and with the module structure
in a sense to be explained. From now on, if there will be no danger of confusion,
Clifford mappings will be often denoted by the dot operation,
c(X)Φ = X · Φ .
Moreover, we will always assume that the Riemannian manifold under consideration
be oriented without further mentioning it.
Thus, let (M, g) be an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Note that the Levi-
Civita connection of g induces a connection in the Clifford bundle
Cl(M) = O+(M) ×ρn Cln ,
as well as in its complexiﬁcation. We denote this connection by ∇g. The Lie algebra
homomorphism induced by (5.5.1) is ρ′
n : so(n) →Der(Cln) , where Der(Cln) is the
Lie algebra of derivations of Cln. Consequently, by (1.4.2), ∇g acts as a derivation
in the algebra of sections of Cl(M),
∇g(ζ · χ) = (∇gζ) · χ + ζ · (∇gχ) ,
(5.5.19)
for any ζ, χ ∈Γ ∞(Cl(M)). Thereby, Γ ∞(Cl0(M)) and Γ ∞(Cl1(M)) are left
invariant. Moreover, under the canonical identiﬁcation Cl(M) ∼=
TM, ∇g leaves
28In textbooks using the convention j(v)2 = −q(v)1 instead of (5.1.2), c(X) is assumed to be
skew-adjoint. Both (5.5.17) and its skew-adjoint counterpart are equivalent to the requirement that
the Hermitean form be invariant under the Clifford action by unit vectors, that is, ⟨c(e)Φ, c(e)Ψ ⟩=
⟨Φ, Ψ ⟩for any e ∈TmM fulﬁlling g(e, e) = 1.

Deﬁnition 5.5.10 (Dirac bundle)
Let (E , h) be a Riemannian (or Hermitean)
Clifford module bundle over a Riemannian manifold (M, g) endowed with an
h-compatible connection ∇. Then, ∇is called a Clifford connection if it is a module
derivation, that is,
∇(ζ · Φ) = ∇g(ζ) · Φ + ζ · ∇Φ ,
(5.5.20)
for any ζ ∈Γ ∞(Cl(M)) and Φ ∈Γ ∞(E ). A Clifford module bundle (E , h) over
(M, g) endowed with a Clifford connection ∇will be referred to as a Dirac bundle
over (M, g). It will be denoted by (E , h, ∇).
Since C∞(M) ⊂Γ ∞(Cl(M)), formula (5.5.20) implies
∇X(f · Φ) = X(f ) · Φ + f · ∇XΦ ,
(5.5.21)
for any X ∈X(M), f ∈C∞(M) and Φ ∈Γ ∞(E ). Since TM ⊂Cl(M), it implies
∇X(Y · Φ) = ∇g
X(Y) · Φ + Y · ∇XΦ ,
(5.5.22)
for any X, Y ∈X(M) and Φ ∈Γ ∞(E ). Clearly, by (5.5.19), ∇g itself is Clifford.
Example 5.5.11 Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold endowed with a spin structure
(S(M), Λ) and let S (M) = S(M)×γ Δn be the canonically associated spinor bundle,
endowed with the ﬁbre metric induced from the scalar product on Δn. Then, the
unique spin connection in S(M) induces a canonical connection in S (M) which is
Clifford. Indeed, the representations γ : Spin(n) →Aut(Δn) and Ad : Spin(n) →
Aut(Cln) preserve the module multiplication, that is,
γ (g)(a · ψ) = (Ad(g)a) · (γ (g)ψ) ,
for any g ∈Spin(n), a ∈Cln and ψ ∈Δn. Differentiating this equation at the identity
of Spin(n) yields the assertion.

3. The notions of Dirac bundle and Dirac operator naturally extend to the pseudo-
Riemannian case.

Using the natural volume form vg on M and the ﬁbre metric h = ⟨·, ·⟩, we endow the
space Γ ∞(E ) with a natural L2-inner product,
⟨Φ1, Φ2⟩L2 :=
 
M
⟨Φ1, Φ2⟩vg ,
Φ1, Φ2 ∈Γ ∞(E ) .
(5.5.25)
In the sequel, we will limit our attention to sections having a ﬁnite L2-norm. This
requirement is always fulﬁlled for M compact or for sections with compact support.
Proposition 5.5.14 With respect to the natural L2-inner product on Γ ∞(E ), the
Dirac operator is formally self-adjoint,
⟨DΦ1, Φ2⟩L2 = ⟨Φ1, DΦ2⟩L2 .
Proof To calculate ⟨DΦ1, Φ2⟩at any point m ∈M, we can use the local formula
(5.5.24). Then, using (5.5.17) and (5.5.22), together with the compatibility condition
for ∇in the form given by (2.6.2), we calculate

Let {ϑj} be the coframe dual to {ej}. Deﬁning α := 
j⟨Φ1, ej · Φ2⟩ϑj and using
(2.1.50), together with Remark 2.7.5, we obtain
⟨DΦ1, Φ2⟩= i d∗α + ⟨Φ1, DΦ2⟩.
This implies the assertion.
■
Remark 5.5.15 Under the assumption that the Riemannian manifold (M, g) be com-
plete, one can show that the Dirac operator is an (unbounded) essentially selfadjoint
operator on L2(E ), see Sect.1I.5 in [407] or Sect.4.1 in [219]. Moreover, we will
see that the Dirac operator has a pure point spectrum, see Proposition 5.7.11.
♦
Let us discuss two basic examples.
Example 5.5.16 (The Clifford bundle) Consider the Clifford bundle Cl(M) over
(M, g) endowed with its canonical Riemannian connection induced from the Levi-
Civita connection of g. Recall that Cl(M) is a bundle of left modules over itself by
left Clifford multiplication. By Proposition 5.1.10, the symbol mapping provides a
vector bundle isomorphism σ : Cl(M) →T∗M. The latter allows us to transport
the Clifford module bundle structure from Cl(M) to T∗M. Then,
c : TM →End(T∗M) ,
c(X)α = g(X) ∧α + X⌟α ,
cf. formula (5.1.8). Thus, the Dirac operator of Cl(M) takes the form
Dα = i

.
Using (2.2.47) and (2.7.23), we obtain
Dα = i(d −d∗)α .
(5.5.26)
♦
Example 5.5.17 (The canonical spinor bundle) Consider the canonical spinor bundle
S (M) = S(M) ×γ Δn of (M, g) relative to a ﬁxed spin structure. As we have seen,
S (M) is a Clifford module bundle with the Clifford mapping given by the spinor
representation γ . For historical reasons, the Dirac operator of S (M) will be denoted
by D/. We have
D/ Φ = i

5.5 Clifford Modules and Dirac Operators

Here, ωij are the coefﬁcients of the spin connection form. In particular, for the
Minkowski space, the Clifford bundle is trivial. Thus, the Clifford action is given by
the spinor representation

γ (eμ) :=

cf. (5.1.26). This yields the Dirac operator of relativistic quantum mechanics in a
convenient representation.
♦
Given a Dirac bundle, one may construct a whole family of associated Dirac bundles
as follows.
Remark 5.5.18 Let (E , h, ∇) be a Dirac bundle over a Riemannian manifold (M, g)
andlet(E, hE, ∇E)beanyRiemannian(orHermitean)vectorbundleoverM endowed
with a compatible connection ∇E. Then, we can endow the tensor product bundle31
E ⊗E with the tensor product metric and with the structure of a bundle of left modules
over Cl(M) by setting
ζ · (Φ ⊗s) := ζ · Φ ⊗s ,
where ζ ∈Cl(TmM), Φ ∈Em and s ∈Em. Clearly, this formula deﬁnes a Clifford
mapping for E ⊗E. Moreover, we equip E ⊗E with the canonical tensor product
connection ∇⊗∇E, deﬁned by

∇⊗∇E
(Φ ⊗s) := (∇Φ) ⊗s + Φ ⊗

∇Es

,
(5.5.28)
cf. Remark 1.5.9/3. It is easy to prove (Exercise 5.5.2) that ∇⊗∇E is formally self-
adjoint and fulﬁls (5.5.20). Correspondingly, we have a naturally associated Dirac
operator DE. The tensor product bundle E ⊗E endowed with the product metric
and with the canonical connection is usually referred to as a twisted Clifford module
bundle and DE is called the twisted Dirac operator.
In particular, assume that E is associated with a principal bundle P and ∇E cor-
responds to a connection form ω. Consider the following special cases:
(a) Let E = Cl(M). This bundle is associated with O+(M) and carries a natural
connection induced from the Levi-Civita connection ω0 of g.
(b) Assume that M is spin and consider S (M). The latter is associated with S(M)
and carries the spin connection ωs of g.
By Remark 1.5.9/3, in both cases the tensor product connection ∇⊗∇E corre-
sponds to the natural connection on the ﬁbre product O+(M) ×M P or S(M) ×M P,
respectively, given by (1.3.16).
♦
31If E is Riemannian, then this is a tensor product over R.

Weitzenboeck Formulae
Here, we take up the discussion of second order differential operators from Sect.2.7.
We derive the counterpart of the Weitzenboeck Theorem 2.7.11 for any Dirac bundle
(E , h, ∇) over a Riemannian manifold (M, g). This will be of fundamental impor-
tance in the sequel. Here, the Weitzenboeck curvature operator RE : Γ ∞(E ) →

∇∗∇: Γ ∞(E ) →Γ ∞(E ), cf. Deﬁnition 2.7.8. The latter is formally self-adjoint
and, by (2.7.31),

Then, for any Φ ∈Γ ∞(E ),

Next, we will ﬁnd a reﬁnement of the Weitzenboeck Formula which corresponds to
the natural algebra bundle isomorphism (5.5.10),
End(E ) ∼= Clc(M) ⊗EndCl(M)(E ) .
As before, let RE be the curvature endomorphism form of ∇, let ∇g be the Levi-
Civita connection of g and let R be the Riemann curvature of g. Moreover, let R∇g ∈
Ω2(M, End(E )) be the curvature endomorphism form of ∇g viewed as a connection
in the Clifford bundle Cl(M). By (5.2.29), for every X, Y ∈X(M),
R∇g(X, Y) = 1

(M, g). Then, for any X, Y, Z ∈X(M), we have
[RE (X, Y), c(Z)] = c(R(X, Y)Z) ,
(5.6.6)
[R∇g(X, Y), c(Z)] = c(R(X, Y)Z) .
(5.6.7)

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Moreover, the curvature endomorphism form of ∇uniquely decomposes as
RE = R∇g + F E ,
(5.6.8)
where F E ∈Ω2(M, EndCl(M)(E )).
Proof To show (5.6.6), we work in a local holonomic frame {el = ∂l}. For X = ei,
Y = ej and Z = ek, the compatibility condition (5.5.22) reads
∇j(ckφ) = (∇g
j ek) · φ + ck∇jφ ,
for any local section φ in E . Thus,
∇i∇j(ckφ) = (∇g
i ∇g
j ek) · φ + (∇g
j ek) · ∇iφ + (∇g
i ek) · ∇jφ + ck∇i∇jφ .
Writing down this equation with i and j exchanged and subtracting it from the ﬁrst
equation, we obtain the assertion. To prove (5.6.7), we chose an orthonormal local
frame {el}. Then, for X = ei, Y = ej and Z = ea, we calculate
[R∇g(ei, ej), ca] = 1

Here, we have used (2.3.15) and [elek, ea] = 0 if k = l or if k, l and a are all distinct.
By (5.6.6) and (5.6.7), [RE (X, Y) −R∇g(X, Y), c(Z)] = 0. This yields (5.6.8).
■
Deﬁnition 5.6.3 The element F E ∈Ω2(M, EndCl(M)(E )) will be referred to as the
twisting curvature of the Dirac bundle E .
Theorem 5.6.4 (Lichnerowicz) Let E be a Dirac bundle over the Riemannian man-
ifold (M, g) and let D be its Dirac operator. Then,
D2 = ∇∗∇+ 1

D2 = ∇∗∇+ Rg + F E .
Thus, it remains to show that Rg = 1

(2.3.16), for any local g-orthonormal frame {ek} on M we calculate

Let us analyze Theorem 5.6.1 for the Dirac operators of Examples 5.5.16 and 5.5.17.
For the canonical spinor bundle, we immediately obtain the following.
Corollary 5.6.5 (Lichnerowicz) For the Dirac operator D/ of the canonical spinor
bundle S (M), the Lichnerowicz Formula reads
D/ 2 = ∇∗∇+ 1
4Sc .
(5.6.11)
■
Next, let (M, g) be an oriented Riemannian manifold carrying a Spinc-structure
Sc(M) and let P be the corresponding principal U(1)-bundle. Let ω be the Levi-
Civita connection on O+(M) and let τ be a connection on P. Then, via the two-fold
covering Sc(M) →O+(E) ×M P, these connections deﬁne a unique connection ωτ
on Sc(M). Let S c(M) be the corresponding canonical spinor bundle32 endowed with
the Dirac operator Dτ deﬁned by ωτ,

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
The decomposition (5.5.10) reads
End(S c(M)) ∼= Clc(M) ⊗End(L) ,
where L is the associated fundamental line bundle deﬁned by (5.4.11). Using this,
together with (5.2.18), we see that in this case the twisting curvature endomorphism is
given by the curvature endomorphism form Fτ ∈End(L) of the curvature Ωτ = dτ.
The latter is given by 1
2Ωτ. Thus, by (5.6.1), its Weitzenboeck curvature operator is
given by
Fτ = −1

Lichnerowicz Formula reads
D2
τΦ = ∇∗∇Φ + 1
4ScΦ −1
2c(Ωτ)Φ .
(5.6.14)

Next, let us turn to the exterior bundle.
Example 5.6.7 (Twisted exterior bundle) Consider the left Cl(M)-module bundle
E = T∗M
with its Dirac operator D = i(d −d∗), see (5.5.26). Then,
D2α = −(d −d∗)(d −d∗)α = (dd∗+ d∗d)α
and, thus, by (2.7.14), D2 coincides with the Hodge-Laplace operator,
D2 = □.
(5.6.15)
Thus, in the case under consideration, the Weitzenboeck Formula (5.6.4) reproduces
Theorem 2.7.11:
□= ∇ω0∗∇ω0α + RΛ(α) ,
where ∇ω0 is the covariant derivative of the Levi-Civita connection and
RΛ = Rijklεiιjεkιl ,
cf. formulae (2.7.39) and (2.7.38). Now, let us consider the twisted Dirac bundle
E = T∗M ⊗E ,

5.6 Weitzenboeck Formulae
415
where (E, hE, ∇E) is some Riemannian (or Hermitean) vector bundle over M
endowed with a compatible connection ∇E and where E is endowed with the canon-
ical tensor product connection ∇= ∇ω0 ⊗∇E, cf. Remark 5.5.18. Let DE be the
Dirac operator of E . Clearly,
RE = RΛ + RE ,
where RΛ and RE are the curvature endomorphism forms of T∗M and E, respec-
tively. Now, Theorem 5.6.1 implies the following Weitzenboeck Formula for this
case:
D2
E = ∇∗∇+ RΛ + RE ,
(5.6.16)
where RΛ and RE are the Weitzenboeck curvature endomorphisms of T∗M and
E, respectively. As a direct consequence of Lemma 2.7.19, we obtain
DE = i(dω −d∗
ω) ,
where ω is the connection form of ∇E. Thus, by (2.7.52),
D2
E = dω ◦d∗
ω + d∗
ω ◦dω = □ω .
(5.6.17)
This yields an alternative proof of the Generalized Weitzenboeck Formula 2.7.20. ♦
Recall from Sect.2.7 that the Weitzenboeck Formula may be used to get insight into
the relation between curvature and topology, cf. Proposition 2.7.14 and Corollary
2.7.15. Here, in particular, we obtain information about harmonic spinors, that is,
sections of S (M) fulﬁlling D/ Φ = 0.
Corollary 5.6.8 Let (M, g) be a compact spin manifold. Then,
1. if the scalar curvature of g is positive, then (M, g) admits no harmonic spinors,33
2. if the scalar curvature of g vanishes identically, then every harmonic spinor on
(M, g) is globally parallel.
Proof Assume D/ Φ = 0 for some Φ ∈Γ ∞(S (M)). Then, integrating the identity
(5.6.11) applied to Φ with respect to the canonical volume form vg yields
1

M
Sc ∥Φ ∥2 vg = −⟨∇∗∇Φ, Φ⟩L2 = −⟨∇Φ, ∇Φ⟩L2 .
This implies both statements.

5.6.2 Prove formula (5.6.17).
33This statement also holds under the weaker assumption that the scalar curvature be non-negative

5.7
Elliptic Complexes. The Hodge Theorem
In this section, we assume that (M, g) is an oriented compact n-dimensional Rie-
mannian manifold.
Let E and F be vector bundles over M. Recall that a differential operator
P : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(F)
of order k is a local linear mapping. While the notion of linearity is obvious, the
notion of locality needs some explanation. In abstract terms, it means that P factors
through the k-jet bundle Jk(E).34 However, here, we prefer a more direct working
deﬁnition. In local coordinates on U ⊂M, the operator P can be represented as
P =

|α|≤k
Pα(x) ∂|α|
∂xα ,
(5.7.1)
where, for any multi-index α = (α1, . . . , αn), Pα is a vector bundle morphism from
E to F over U symmetric in the indices of α.
Given vector bundles E and F and a differential operator P : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(F),
one deﬁnes the formal adjoint P∗: Γ ∞(F∗) →Γ ∞(E∗) acting between the spaces
of sections of the dual bundles F∗and E∗by setting
 
M
χ(Pφ) vg =
 
M
(P∗χ)φ vg ,
(5.7.2)
for any φ ∈Γ ∞(E) and χ ∈Γ ∞(F∗). It is easy to show that the formal adjoint
exists and that it is unique.
It is easy to check that the k-th order coefﬁcients of P given by (5.7.1) transform
as a tensor ﬁeld M →Sk(TM) ⊗Hom(E, F) over U. Here, Sk(TM) denotes the
k-fold symmetric tensor product of TM. This suggests the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.7.1 (Principal symbol) Let P : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(F) be a differential
operator of order k and let π : TM →M be the canonical bundle projection. The
principal symbol of P is a mapping which assigns to each point ξ ∈T∗M a mapping
σξ(P) : Eπ(ξ) →Fπ(ξ) deﬁned by
σξ(P) := ik 
|α|=k
Pα(π(ξ))ξ α ,
(5.7.3)
where ξ = 
j ξjdxj and ξ α = ξ α1
1 · · · ξ αn
n .
34That is, there is a vector bundle morphism ϕP : Jk(E) →F such that P = ϕP ◦jk, where
jk : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(Jk(E)) is the k-th jet prolongation. This means that P(s)(m) is determined
by the germ of the section s at the point m. Conversely, by a theorem of Peetre, any linear local
operator is differential.

5.7 Elliptic Complexes. The Hodge Theorem
417
Formula (5.7.3) deﬁnes local sections over T∗U of the bundle
Hom(π∗(E), π∗(F)) →T∗M
which glue together to a global section. By deﬁnition, this section is homogeneously
polynomial of degree k along the ﬁbres of T∗M. Thus, the principal symbol is a
bundle morphism
σ(P) : π∗(E) →π∗(F) .
Remark 5.7.2 By multilinearization, we may identify the space of those sections of
Hom(π∗(E), π∗(F)) which are homogeneously polynomial of degree k along the
ﬁbres of T∗M with the space of sections of the bundle Sk(TM) ⊗Hom(E, F) →M.
That is, the symbol may be also viewed as a section
σ(P) : M →Sk(TM) ⊗Hom(E, F) .
♦
If P : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(F) and Q : Γ ∞(F) →Γ ∞(L) are differential operators over
M, then their principal symbols fulﬁl the following (Exercise 5.7.1):
σξ(Q + P) = σξ(Q) + σξ(P) ,
(5.7.4)
σξ(Q ◦P) = σξ(Q) ◦σξ(P) .
(5.7.5)
If E and F are Riemannian or Hermitean, then
σξ(P∗) = (σξ(P))† ,
(5.7.6)
where P∗is the formal adjoint with respect to the L2-inner products.
Deﬁnition 5.7.3 (Elliptic differential operator) A differential operator P is called
elliptic if its principal symbol σξ(P) is a vector space isomorphism for all ξ ̸= 0.
By (5.7.6), P is elliptic iff P∗is elliptic.
Proposition 5.7.4 Let D be the Dirac operator of a Dirac bundle (E , h, ∇) over a
Riemannian manifold (M, g). Then, for any ξ ∈T∗M,
σξ(D) = −g−1(ξ) ,
σξ(D2) =∥ξ ∥2 ,
(5.7.7)
where the symbols on the right denote Clifford multiplication with the vector −g−1(ξ)
and with the scalar ∥ξ ∥2= g−1(ξ, ξ), respectively. In particular, both D and D2
are elliptic.
Using the identiﬁcation T∗M ∼= TM, it is common to write σξ(D) = −ξ.

Now, recall Remark 5.5.15. For a Dirac bundle E over a complete Riemannian
manifold (M, g), the Dirac operator viewed as an operator on L2(E ) is unbounded and
self-adjoint. Thus, we have the full theory of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces
at our disposal. However, for many purposes, in particular, for purposes of index
theory one needs a functional analytic setting in which the operators are bounded
and which in a sense accounts for the degree of differentiability. This setting is
provided by the theory of Sobolev spaces. This is an established part of modern
analysis and there is a number of textbook presentations, see e.g. [501]. So, here we
only make some elementary remarks for further reference.35
Given a vector bundle E over (M, g) endowed with a ﬁbre metric ⟨·, ·⟩and a
compatible connection ∇, using the Riemannian metric g, one deﬁnes the inner
product
⟨φ, ψ⟩Wk :=
 
M

⟨φ, ψ⟩+ ⟨∇φ, ∇ψ⟩+ . . . + ⟨∇kφ, ∇kψ⟩

vg .
(5.7.8)
Then, by deﬁnition, the Sobolev space Wk(E) is the completion
Wk(E) := {φ ∈C∞(E) : ∥φ ∥Wk < ∞} .
(5.7.9)
Note that Wk(E) is a Hilbert space for any k.36 In particular, W0(E) = L2(E) and
we obviously have ∥φ ∥Wk ≤∥φ ∥Wk′ for k′ < k. The Sobolev norm induced from
(5.7.8) depends on g, ⟨·, ·⟩and ∇. However, it is easy to see that different choices
of these data lead to equivalent norms, that is, as a topological vector space, Wk(E)
depends only on the underlying vector bundle. Moreover, one can check that, for
compact M, the Sobolev norm ∥φ ∥Wk is equivalent to the norm deﬁned by the
scalar product
35Actually, for purposes of this chapter, the short presentations of Sobolev theory in [246, 407] or
[535] are sufﬁcient.
36There is a Banach space version based on Lp-norms which, however, we do not need here.

where {Ui} is some ﬁnite covering of M by local coordinates {xj} (Exercise 5.7.2).
We can extend the above deﬁnition to negative k by duality, that is, W−k is the dual
of Wk with respect to the L2-pairing.37 As a consequence, one obtains the following
sequence of embeddings
S ⊂W∞⊂. . . ⊂W1 ⊂W0 = L2 ⊂W−1 ⊂. . . W−∞⊂S ′ .
Here, W∞= %
k Wk, W−∞= 	
k Wk and S ′ denotes the space of tempered dis-
tributions. The statements of the following proposition are immediate consequences
of the deﬁnition of Wk (Exercise 5.7.4).
Proposition 5.7.5
1. For any k′ > k, there is a bounded inclusion Wk′ →Wk.
2. Every covariant derivative is a bounded mapping ∇: Wk(E) →Wk−1(E).
3. Any vector bundle morphism ϕ : E →F covering a diffeomorphism extends to a
bounded mapping Wk(E) →Wk(F) for every k.
4. Any differential operator P : C∞(E) →C∞(F) of order p extends to a bounded
mapping Wk(E) →Wk−p(E) for all k.
5. If V ⊂Wk(E) is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace, then we have the L2-orthogonal
direct sum decomposition
Wk(E) = V ⊕V ⊥.
The following two lemmas are of basic importance.
Lemma 5.7.6 (Rellich) The inclusion Wk′ →Wk is compact for k′ > k ≥0.
Lemma 5.7.7 (Sobolev) If k > 1
2 dim M + p, then Wk ⊂Cp(E) and the embedding
is continuous.
Finally, the formal adjoint of a differential operator P deﬁned by (5.7.2) extends to
a bounded operator between Sobolev spaces. In detail, if P : Wk(E) →Wl(F), then
P∗: W−l(F) →W−k(E) is given by
(Pφ, χ) = (φ, P∗χ) .
(5.7.11)
Now, let us study the Dirac operator D of a Dirac bundle E (or of a twisted version
E ⊗E) in the context of Sobolev spaces. Our presentation is along the lines of [219]
and [212]. By Proposition 5.7.5, we obtain bounded Sobolev extensions
37In fact, W−k can be endowed with a Hilbert space structure via the Fourier transform of (5.7.8).
This way, Wk can be deﬁned for any real number k. This is of importance in the theory of pseudo-
differential operators.

(5.7.13)
In the sequel, one of our main objectives will be to prove that D is Fredholm. This
notion is at the heart of index theory.
Deﬁnition 5.7.8 (Fredholm operator) Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces and let
T : H1 →H2 be a bounded linear operator. Then, T is called Fredholm if its kernel
and cokernel are both ﬁnite-dimensional. The integer
ind(T) := dim(ker T) −dim(coker T)
is referred to as the index of T.
Often, ind(T) is also called the analytic index of T.
Using the Closed Graph Theorem, one can show that every Fredholm operator
has a closed range, see Lemma 2.1 in [29]. This implies (Exercise 5.7.3)
H2 = im T ⊕ker T ∗,
(5.7.14)
and, hence,
coker T = H2/T(H1) ∼= ker T ∗.
(5.7.15)
We conclude
ind(T) = dim(ker T) −dim(ker T ∗) .
(5.7.16)
A key role in the analysis below is played by the Weitzenboeck Formula 5.6.1. By
point 3 of Proposition 5.7.5, the Weitzenboeck curvature operator is bounded, that
is, there exists c > 0 such that

ψ + ∇∗∇ψ = D2ψ + (1 −R∇)ψ ,
(5.7.20)
take the L2-scalar product of this equation with ψ and use (5.7.17). This immediately
yields (5.7.18). Next, using (5.7.13) and (5.7.18), we derive

Let us denote the spectrum of the self-adjoint operator D on L2(E ) by σ(D).
Proposition 5.7.11 Let E be a Dirac bundle over the compact Riemannian manifold
(M, g) with Dirac operator D. Then, the following hold.
1. The closure D = D∗of D is deﬁned on W1(E ) ⊂L2(E ).
2. If λ /∈σ(D), then (D −λ)−1 : L2(E ) →L2(E ) is a compact operator.
3. There is a complete orthonormal basis ψ1, ψ2, . . . of L2(E ) consisting of eigen-
vectors of D, Dψn = λnψn. Moreover, the eigenspaces are all ﬁnite-dimensional
and limn→∞|λn| = ∞.

422

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Proof 1. Let ψ ∈D(D) belong to the domain of deﬁnition of D. Then, there exists
a sequence {ψn} of elements of Γ ∞(E ) such that ψn →ψ in L2 and D(ψn) converges
in L2. Thus, by (5.7.18), {ψn} is a Cauchy sequence in W1(E ) and, thus, ψn converges
to some element ˜ψ ∈W1(E ). Since the embedding W1(E ) →L2(E ) is continuous,
ψ and ˜ψ must coincide, that is, ψ ∈W1(E ). Conversely, if ψ ∈W1(E ), then it
clearly belongs to D(D).
2. We rewrite the inequality (5.7.18) as
∥(D −λ)−1(D −λ)ψ ∥2
W1 ≤2 ∥(D −λ)ψ ∥2
L2 +(1 + 2λ2 + c) ∥ψ ∥2
L2 .
Denoting φ = (D −λ)ψ, we obtain
∥(D −λ)−1φ ∥2
W1 ≤2 ∥φ ∥2
L2 +(1 + 2λ2 + c) ∥(D −λ)−1φ ∥2
L2 .
Since (D −λ)−1 is bounded in L2(E ), there exists a number C > 0 such that
∥(D −λ)−1φ ∥2
W1 ≤C ∥φ ∥2
L2 .
Thus, the image of (D −λ)−1 is contained in W1(E ) and the assertion follows from
the compactness of the embedding W1(E ) →L2(E ).
3. The third assertion follows from the standard spectral theory of compact self-
adjoint operators. If we choose λ /∈σ(D) real, then (D −λ)−1 is of this type. Thus,
there exists a complete orthonormal basis {ψn} in L2(E ), such that
(D −λ)−1ψn = μnψn ,
μn ̸= 0 ,
lim
n→∞μn = 0 .
This implies Dψn = λnψn with eigenvalues given by λn = (μ−1

limn→∞|λn| = ∞. Moreover, every eigenspace is ﬁnite-dimensional.
■
Corollary 5.7.12 There exists a real number C > 0 such that
|⟨Dφ, φ⟩L2| ≥C ∥φ ∥2
L2
for all φ ∈W1(E ) which are orthogonal to ker(D).
Proof By point 2 of Proposition 5.7.11, we can decompose φ = ′
n cnψn, where
the sum is taken over all eigenvectors corresponding to non-vanishing eigenvalues.
Then, using the orthonormality of the set {ψn}, we obtain

5.7 Elliptic Complexes. The Hodge Theorem
423
Remark 5.7.13 (Elliptic regularity) It turns out that the eigenfunctions of a Dirac
operator are smooth. This is a basic principle in the theory of elliptic operators which,
in the context of Dirac operators, may be proved by elementary means. We outline
the idea of this proof and refer to [212] for details. First, by point 1 of Proposition
5.7.11, every eigenfunction of a Dirac operator D belongs to W1(E ). Next, starting
from the Gårding inequality, by simple iteration type arguments, one proves that
∥ψ ∥Wk+2 ≤C(∥D2ψ ∥Wk + ∥ψ ∥Wk) ,
(5.7.24)
for any ψ ∈Wk+2(E ), k ≥0. Using some analytic tools,38 from this estimate one
may conclude the following: if ψ ∈Wk(E ) and D2ψ ∈Wk(E ), then ψ ∈Wk+2(E ).
Iterating this argument one concludes that the eigenfunctions ψn belong to Wk(E )
for all k and, thus, by the Sobolev Lemma, they are smooth.

into a sum of countably many ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces Hλ. Each Hλ is an
eigenspace of D with eigenvalue λ consisting of smooth sections. The eigenvalues λ

♦
Theorem 5.7.15 Let E be a Dirac bundle over a compact Riemannian manifold
(M, g). Then, its Dirac operator D : Wk+1(E ) →Wk(E ) with k ≥0 is a Fredholm
operator with index zero. Moreover,
Wk(E ) = ker D ⊕im(D) .
(5.7.26)
Proof We prove that ker D and L2(E )/ im(D) are ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces
of the same dimension.
(a) The basic elliptic estimate (5.7.23) implies
∥ψ ∥2
Wk+1≤Ck ∥ψ ∥2
Wk ,
(5.7.27)
for any ψ ∈ker(D). Now, choose a sequence {ψn} fulﬁlling ∥ψ ∥2
Wk+1≤1 and
Dψn = 0. Then, by the Rellich Lemma, there exists a subsequence which is Wk-
convergent and, by (5.7.27), this subsequence is Cauchy in the Wk+1-norm. Thus, by
completeness of Wk+1(E ), there exists a Wk+1-convergent subsequence. This proves
compactness of the unit ball and, thus, ker(D) is ﬁnite-dimensional.
(b) We prove that im(D) is closed in Wk(E ). For that purpose, we decompose39
38Either difference quotients or Friedrich molliﬁers.
39Cf. point 5 of Proposition 5.7.5.

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Wk+1(E ) = ker(D) ⊕(ker(D))⊥
and restrict D to (ker(D))⊥. Then, it is injective. Let ψ = limn→∞Dψn belong to
the closure of im(D). Then, {ψn} is Wk+1-bounded: assume that this is not the case.
Then, there exists a subsequence {ψm} such that ∥ψm ∥Wk+1→∞and the sequence
ϕm :=
ψm
∥ψm ∥Wk+1
consists of elements whose Wk+1-norm is equal to 1. Moreover, limm→∞Dϕm = 0
in the Wk-norm. By the Rellich Lemma, there exists a Wk-convergent subsequence
{ϕl} and, by the Gårding inequality, {ϕl} converges to some ˆϕ in the Wk+1-norm.
By continuity, D ˆϕ = 0. But, on the other hand, ∥ˆϕ ∥Wk= 1. By the injectivity
of D, this is a contradiction. This shows that {ψn} is Wk+1-bounded, indeed. Thus,
again applying the Rellich Lemma and the Gårding inequality, we obtain a Wk+1-
convergent subsequence whose limit ˆψ satisﬁes D ˆψ = ψ. Thus, the image is closed.
(c) We decompose
Wk(E ) = ker(D) ⊕(ker(D))⊥
and prove im(D) = (ker(D))⊥. By point (b), it is enough to show that im(D) is dense
in (ker(D))⊥: let η ∈W−k(E ) such that
η(Dψ) = 0
for all ψ ∈Wk+1(E ). By the Hahn-Banach Theorem, it is enough to show that the
restriction of η to (ker(D))⊥vanishes. By assumption, D∗η = 0, where
D∗: W−k(E ) →W−(k+1)(E )
is the Sobolev extension of the formal adjoint deﬁned by (5.7.11). By elliptic regu-
larity, η is smooth and, therefore, D∗coincides with the formal adjoint of D when
applied to η. Thus, by the self-adjointness of D,
D∗η = Dη .
Thus, η ∈ker(D), that is, the restriction of η to (ker(D))⊥vanishes, indeed.
■
Remark 5.7.16 Theorem 5.7.15 and elliptic regularity imply the following.
1. The quotient space coker(D) may be represented by a subspace consisting of
smooth sections. Thus, the index of D does not depend on the Sobolev extension
used.

5.7 Elliptic Complexes. The Hodge Theorem
425
2. Since ker(D) ⊂Γ ∞(E ), formula (5.7.26) implies
Γ ∞(E ) = ker(D) ⊕im(D) .
(5.7.28)
♦
Using the elliptic estimate (5.7.24) for D2, by the same arguments as in the above
proof, we obtain the following.
Theorem 5.7.17 Let E be a Dirac bundle over a compact Riemannian manifold
(M, g) with Dirac operator D : Wk+2(E ) →Wk+1(E ), where k ≥0. Then, its
square D2 : Wk+2(E ) →Wk(E ) is a Fredholm operator with index zero. Moreover,
Wk(E ) = ker(D2) ⊕im(D2) .
(5.7.29)
■
Let us apply Theorem 5.7.17 to the important special case of the twisted Dirac bundle
E = T∗M ⊗E with its Dirac operator DE. By Example 5.6.7,
D2
E = dω ◦d∗
ω + d∗
ω ◦dω = □ω .
(5.7.30)
We extend dω and d∗
ω to operators
dω : Wk+1(pT∗M ⊗E) →Wk(p+1T∗M ⊗E) ,
d∗
ω : Wk(p+1T∗M ⊗E) →Wk−1(pT∗M ⊗E) .
Then,
□ω : Wk+1(T∗M ⊗E) →Wk−1(T∗M ⊗E) .
(5.7.31)
Thus, Theorem 5.7.17 implies the following.
Theorem 5.7.18 (Hodge Decomposition Theorem) The following L2-orthogonal
direct sum decomposition holds:
Wk−1(T∗M ⊗E) = ker(□ω) ⊕im(□ω) .
(5.7.32)
■
Again, by elliptic regularity, we have ker(□ω) ⊂Γ ∞(T∗M ⊗E). Thus, we obtain
the Hodge Decomposition Theorem 2.7.2 as a special case.
As a consequence of Theorem 5.7.18, the bounded linear mapping
□ω : ker(□ω)⊥→im(□ω)
(5.7.33)
is bijective, where im(□ω) is a closed subspace and thus a Hilbert space itself. Hence,
by the Open Mapping Theorem, (5.7.33) is an isomorphism. Taking the inverse and

426
5
Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
extending it by 0 to ker(□ω), we obtain a bounded linear operator
Gω : Wk−1(T∗M ⊗E) →Wk+1(T∗M ⊗E) ,
(5.7.34)
called the Green's operator of □ω.
Remark 5.7.19
1. Clearly, if ξ ∈ker(□ω), then Gω□ωξ = 0. Moreover, by deﬁnition of Gω, if
ξ ∈ker(□ω)⊥, then Gω□ωξ = ξ. Thus, the bounded linear operator Gω□ω on
Wk+1(T∗M ⊗E) is the L2-orthogonal projector onto the subspace ker(□ω)⊥.
2. By deﬁnition of Gω, if χ ∈im(□ω), then □ωGωχ = χ and if χ ∈im(□ω)⊥, then
□ωGωχ = 0. Thus, the bounded linear operator □ωGω on Wk−1(T∗M ⊗E) is
the L2-orthogonal projector onto the subspace im(□ω).
♦
The above results are special cases of general results holding true in the theory
of elliptic operators. This general theory heavily rests on the calculus of pseudo-
differential operators. In more detail, for an elliptic operator P : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(F)
of order p over a compact manifold M, the following hold true, see [407]:
(a) For any open subset U ⊂M and any φ ∈Wk(E), the smoothness of (Pφ)↾U
implies the smoothness of φ↾U.
(b) For every k, P extends to a Fredholm operator P : Wk(E) →Wk−p(F) with
dim(ker P), dim(coker P) and ind(P) being independent of k.
(c) For every k, the norms ∥· ∥Wk and ∥· ∥Wk−p + ∥P · ∥Wk−p are equivalent.
As a direct consequence of these facts, for every elliptic self-adjoint differential
operator P : Γ ∞(E) →Γ ∞(E), one obtains
(d) The operator P shares the spectral properties listed in Remark 5.7.14.
(e) There is an L2-orthogonal direct sum decomposition
Γ ∞(E) = ker P ⊕im P .
(5.7.35)
In the remainder of this section, we will consider the following natural generalization
of an elliptic operator.
Deﬁnition 5.7.20 (Elliptic complex) Let E = (E0, . . . , En) be a ﬁnite collection
of Riemannian (or Hermitean) vector bundles over a manifold M and let P =
(P0, . . . , Pn−1) be a collection of differential operators Pk : Γ ∞(Ek) →Γ ∞(Ek+1)
of order p. The pair (E, P) is called a complex if Pk+1 ◦Pk = 0. It is called elliptic if
ker(σξ(Pk)) = im(σξ(Pk−1)) ,
(5.7.36)
for every 0 ̸= ξ ∈T∗M.

We will be mainly interested in the case p = 1.40 Let us deﬁne
Ee :=

E2k ,
Eo :=

k
E2k+1 ,
(5.7.37)
and associated mappings P e : Γ ∞(Ee) →Γ ∞(Eo) and P o : Γ ∞(Eo) →Γ ∞(Ee)
by
P e :=

k
(P2k + P∗
2k−1) ,
P o :=

k
(P2k+1 + P∗
2k) .
(5.7.38)
Note that (P e)∗= P o. Moreover, let us consider the associated Laplace operators,
□k := Pk−1P∗
k−1 + P∗
kPk : Γ ∞(Ek) →Γ ∞(Ek) .
(5.7.39)
Then, the Laplace operator of (E, P) is deﬁned by
□:=

k
□k = P oP e + P eP o = □e + □o ,
(5.7.40)
where □e and □o are the restrictions of □to Ee and Eo, respectively. It is easy to
show the following (Exercise 5.7.6).
Proposition 5.7.21 The following statements are equivalent:
1. (E, P) is an elliptic complex.
2. □k is elliptic for all k.
3. P e is elliptic.
■
Now, let us limit our attention to compact Riemannian manifolds (M, g) again. Then,
by the above discussion, every element Pk of an elliptic complex (E, P) extends to
a Fredholm operator and, thus, we can deﬁne the cohomology groups of (E, P) by
Hk(E, P) := ker(Pk)/ im(Pk−1)
(5.7.41)
and its index by
ind(E, P) :=

k
(−1)k dim(Hk(E, P)) .
(5.7.42)
Associated with the above family of Laplace operators, one has a generalized Hodge
Theorem.41 The latter implies
Hk(E, P) = ker(□k) .
(5.7.43)
40One can also consider the more general case when the Pi are of different order [32].
41See e.g. Theorem 1.5.2 in [246].

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Then,
ind(E, P) =

k
(−1)k dim(ker □k)
= dim(ker □e) −dim(ker □o)
= dim(ker(P e∗P e)) −dim(ker(P eP e∗))
= dim(ker P e) −dim(ker P e∗) .
Thus,
ind(E, P) = ind(P e) .
(5.7.44)
This reduces the computation of the index to the computation of the index of a two-
term complex, that is, of a single elliptic operator. In this context, one often says that
one can use the operators P e or P o to roll up the elliptic complex.
We close this section by considering the classical examples of elliptic complexes.
They will be taken up again in Sect.5.9.
Example 5.7.22 (De Rham complex) Consider Ek := kT∗M and take for Pk the
exterior differential
dk : Γ ∞(kT∗M) →Γ ∞(k+1T∗M) .
As before, we denote the operations of exterior multiplication and contraction by
ε and ι, respectively. Since d2 = 0, we must only check the ellipticity condition
(5.7.36). Let ξ ̸= 0. Clearly,
σξ(dk)(α) = iξ ∧α ,
(5.7.45)
for any α ∈kT∗M. Thus, im(σξ(dk−1)) ⊂ker(σξ(dk)). To prove the converse
inclusion, let α ∈ker(σξ(dk)), that is, ξ ∧α = 0. Choose a local coordinate system
{xj} such that ξ = dx1. Then, α = dx1 ∧β with β ∈k−1T∗M. This shows
α ∈im(σξ(dk−1)). Thus, the de Rham complex is elliptic with the principal symbol
given by σ(dk) = iε. We denote it by EdR(M).
Next, consider the formal adjoint d∗
k : Γ ∞(k+1T∗M) →Γ ∞(kT∗M). Then,
(2.7.23) immediately implies
σξ(d∗
k)(α) = −ig−1(ξ)⌟α ,
that is, σ(d∗
k) = −iι ◦g−1. Next, since □= dd∗+ d∗d, (5.7.5) and (2.7.33) imply
σξ(□) = ε(ξ)ι(g−1(ξ)) + ι(g−1(ξ))ε(ξ) =∥ξ ∥2 ·1 .

5.7 Elliptic Complexes. The Hodge Theorem
429
This shows that □is elliptic.42 Finally, by (5.7.41) and (5.7.42), the cohomology
groups of the de Rham complex coincide with the de Rham cohomology groups of
M and, thus, its index coincides with the Euler characteristic χ(M).
♦
Example 5.7.23 (Signature complex) Let (M, g) be an even-dimensional oriented
compact Riemannian manifold. Denote dim M = 2n. Consider the Clifford bundle
Cl(M) of (M, g). By Example 5.5.16, Cl(M) is isomorphic to T∗M as a Clifford
module bundle. Under this identiﬁcation, the Clifford mapping of Cl(M) is given by
c : TM →End(T∗M) ,
c(X)α = g(X) ∧α + X⌟α ,
and the Dirac operator reads Dα = i(d −d∗)α. Now, recall that the chirality element
Γ2n := i nc(v) implies a natural decomposition Clc
n = Cl+
n ⊕Cl−
n of the complexiﬁed
Clifford algebra, cf. (5.3.7) and (5.3.13). Clearly, Γ2n induces an involutive automor-
phism of Cl(M) ⊗C yielding a splitting of that bundle. It is easy to check (Exercise
5.7.7) that, under the identiﬁcation with T∗M ⊗C, this involutive automorphism
is given by
τ : kT∗M ⊗C →2n−kT∗M ⊗C ,
τ(α) := i n+k(k+1) ∗α .
(5.7.46)
Since τ 2 = id, we can decompose
T∗M ⊗C = +T∗M ⊕−T∗M
(5.7.47)
into subbundles of elements corresponding to eigenvalues ±1 of τ. Next, it is easy
to show (Exercise 5.7.9) that
c(X) ◦τ + τ ◦c(X) = 0 ,
X ∈X(M) ,
(5.7.48)
and, correspondingly,
D ◦τ + τ ◦D = 0 .
(5.7.49)
This is in accordance with point 2 of Lemma 5.3.4. By (5.7.49), the restrictions of
D to the subbundles +T∗M and −T∗M yield mappings
d± : Γ ∞(±T∗M) →Γ ∞(∓T∗M) ,
(5.7.50)
and, thus, a complex
0 −→Γ ∞(+T∗M)
d+
−→Γ ∞(−T∗M) −→0 ,
which will be referred to as the signature complex of M and will be denoted by
Esgn(M). It may be viewed as obtained by rolling up the de Rham complex using

the Z2-grading deﬁned by (5.7.47). Clearly, d−is the adjoint of d+. By Proposition
5.7.4, D is elliptic and, thus, d+ and d−are elliptic, too. We deﬁne
σ(M) := ind(d+)
(5.7.51)
and call it the signature of M. By (5.7.16), we have σ(M) = dim(ker(d+)) −
dim(ker(d−)) and, using ker(d∗
+) ⊂im(d+)⊥, we obtain
σ(M) = dim(ker(□+)) −dim(ker(□−)) ,
(5.7.52)
where □+ = d−d+ and □−= d+d−. Clearly, if we change the orientation of M,
then d+ and d−are interchanged and, thus, the signature changes its sign. Moreover,
we have
σ(M) = 0 ,
for dim M = 2 (mod 4) .
(5.7.53)
Indeed, in this case, one can check that complex conjugation yields an isomorphism
+T∗M ∼= −T∗M which clearly implies the assertion (Exercise 5.7.8). This shows
that only the case dim M = 4k is interesting. Here, we have
σ(M) = dim(ker(□+
2k)) −dim(ker(□−
2k)) ,
for dim M = 4k ,
(5.7.54)
where □±
2k denote the restrictions of □± to the subspaces of form degree 2k. To prove
this statement, observe that the mappings
ϕ± : pT∗M →(pT∗M ⊕4k−pT∗M)± ,
ϕ±(α) := 1
2(α ± τα) ,
(5.7.55)
are isomorphisms of vector bundles intertwining □+
k with □−
k (Exercise 5.7.10). This
implies
(pT∗M ⊕4k−pT∗M)+ ∼=
pT∗M ∼= (pT∗M ⊕4k−pT∗M)−,
for every p ̸= 4k −p. Thus, all contributions in (5.7.52) cancel except for those
corresponding to form degree p = 2k.
Finally, the Hodge Theorem implies via ker(□2k) ∼= H2k
dR(M) a purely topological
formula for the signature as follows. For a closed, connected, oriented manifold of
dimension 2n, one deﬁnes a pairing
sM : Hn
dR(M) × Hn
dR(M) →R ,
sM([α], [β]) :=
 
M
α ∧β .
(5.7.56)
If Hn
dR(M) = 0, we put sM = 0. This is a symmetric, non-degenerate bilinear form
on Hn
dR(M) called the intersection form of M. Let (b+, b−) be the signature of the
quadratic form corresponding to sM. Now, for dim M = 4k we have τ = ∗and, thus,
for a (real) 2k-form α representing an element of (H2k
dR(M))± we have

Thus,

Example 5.7.24 (Spin complex) As before, let (M, g) be a 2n-dimensional oriented
compact Riemannian manifold. Consider the canonical spinor bundle
S (M) = S(M) ×γ Δn
relative to a chosen spin structure on M, cf. formula (5.5.8). Since dim M = 2n, it
splits into a direct sum of subbundles,
S (M) = S +(M) ⊕S −(M) ,
S ±(M) = S(M) ×γ Δ±
n .
By Example 5.5.17, the Dirac operator of S (M) is given by
D/ Φ = i
n

j=1
cj∇ejΦ ,
Φ ∈Γ ∞(S (M)) ,
where ∇is the spin connection. By Remark 5.5.5, for dim M = 2n, the Clifford map-
ping c implies a bundle isomorphism c(X) : S ±(M) →S ∓(M) for any nowhere
vanishing vector ﬁeld X on M. This induces a splitting of the Dirac operator,
D/ ± : Γ ∞
S ±(M)

→Γ ∞
S ∓(M)

(5.7.58)
By Proposition 5.7.4, D/ is elliptic. Thus, D/ ± are elliptic, too, and we obtain an elliptic
complex
0 −→Γ ∞(S +(M))
D/ +
−→Γ ∞(S −(M)) −→0 ,
which will be referred to as the spin complex of (M, g) with respect to the chosen
spin structure. Clearly, D/ −is the adjoint of D/ +. The index of this complex, that is,
the index of D/ will be shown to coincide with the ˆA-genus43 ˆA(M) of the manifold
M, see Corollary 5.9.1.
Let E be a Riemannian (or Hermitean) vector bundle over M endowed with a
compatible connection. Consider the tensor product S (M) ⊗E. By Remark 5.5.18,
there is a natural associated twisted Dirac operator D/ E with the Clifford action given
by γ ⊗id. Thus, D/ E is elliptic and the same construction as above yields the twisted
spin complex

deﬁned by
∂:= Πp+1,q ◦d ,

∂2 = 0 ,
∂

∂◦∂+ ∂◦∂= 0 .
(5.7.62)
Thus, for any p,

restricts attention to p = 0. By (5.7.45), the symbol of ∂is given by
σξ(∂)(α) = iξ 0,1 ∧α ,
(5.7.64)
where ξ = ξ 1,0 + ξ 0,1 is the decomposition implied from (5.7.60). We conclude that
the Dolbeault complex is elliptic. The index of the Dolbeault complex is referred to
as the arithmetic genus of the manifold M. It is denoted by Ag(M).
Now, let M be additionally endowed with a Riemannian metric g compatible
with J, that is, g(X, Y) = g(JX, JY) for any X, Y ∈X(M). Then, the Dolbeault
complex ﬁts into the general framework of this section. Indeed, by (2.2.10), for any
local g-orthonormal frame {ek} on M, the (1, 0)- and (0, 1)-components of TM are
locally spanned by {ek −iJek} and {ek + iJek}, respectively. By the compatibility of
g and J, both components are g-isotropic. Thus, the corresponding decomposition
of the exterior bundle is, pointwise, a special case of the construction of the Clifford
modules SW and SW in Sect.5.3 with the Clifford action induced from (5.3.27).
Finally, Proposition 2.6.6 ensures that the Dolbeault complex may be twisted with
a vector bundle E endowed with a ﬁbre metric and a compatible connection.

The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem
In this section, some of the analytic details will be omitted. This applies, in particular,
to standard Sobolev-type arguments. For a full treatment of the subject we refer to
the classical papers by Atiyah, Bott, Getzler, Gilkey, McKean, Patody, Segal and
Singer [32, 34, 39, 40, 242, 243, 245, 435], as well as to the monographs [72, 246,
407, 533].
The discussion in the previous section suggests to consider the following general
setting.
Deﬁnition 5.8.1 (Graded Dirac bundle) A graded Dirac bundle is a Dirac bundle E
endowed with an involutive self-adjoint vertical bundle automorphism τ : E →E
anticommuting with the Clifford action and with the Dirac operator D of E .
The operator τ will be called the grading operator. Note that anticommuting with D
is equivalent to commuting with the underlying Clifford connection. Also note that
the Examples 5.7.23, 5.7.24 and 5.7.25 are of that type.

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Let there be given a graded Dirac bundle E over a compact Riemannian manifold
(M, g). By involutivity, τ has (ﬁbrewise) the eigenvalues ±1 and, thus, we may
decompose
E = E + ⊕E −.
(5.8.1)
This way, E becomes a Z2-graded Clifford module bundle. In the sequel, we will
be concerned with even-dimensional oriented manifolds M.44 In that case, there is
always a canonical grading induced from the chirality element Γ , cf. (5.3.7) and
Lemma 5.3.4.
In the present context, it is quite common and convenient to use the terminology
of superspaces, see e.g. [72, 535]. In this language, E is a superbundle, its ﬁbres
are superspaces and the algebra bundle End(E ) is a superalgebra bundle, that is, τ
acting by conjugation induces a decomposition End(E ) = End(E )0 ⊕End(E )1 into
an even and an odd part fulﬁlling
End(Em)i · End(Em)j ⊂End(Em)(i+j mod 2) ,
for every m ∈M. For any A0 ∈End(Em)0 and A1 ∈End(Em)1, we have
τ(A0 + A1)τ = A0 −A1 .
Associated with the above decomposition, we have a natural notion of parity. We
say that an even element A0 ∈End(E )0 has parity |A0| = 0 and an odd element
A1 ∈End(E )1 has parity |A1| = 1. Using this, one can endow End(E ) with the
structure of a Lie superalgebra bundle by deﬁning the super-commutator ﬁbrewise
as the bilinear extension of
[A, B]τ := A · B −(−1)|A||B|B · A .
Moreover, the following notion of supertrace relative to the grading τ is useful. For
an even element A, we deﬁne
strE (A) := Tr(τA) .
(5.8.2)
Then,
strE (A) = Tr(A++) −Tr(A−−) ,
(5.8.3)
where A++ and A−−are the diagonal blocks of A with respect to the decomposition
(5.8.1). In particular, for an odd element A, we have StrE (A) = 0. One easily shows
the following (Exercise 5.8.1):
strE ([A, B]τ) = 0 .
(5.8.4)
44We will see soon that the index vanishes if M is odd-dimensional.

5.8 The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem
435
Below, we also need the superalgebra A of bounded operators on L2(E ) and their
supertrace. Clearly, the decomposition (5.8.1) induces the decomposition
L2(E ) = L2(E +) ⊕L2(E −) .
(5.8.5)
Next, viewing τ as an operator acting on L2(E ), we obtain a corresponding decom-
position A = A0 ⊕A1 into an even and an odd part fulﬁlling
Ai · Aj ⊂Ai+j mod 2 .
Note that L2(E ±) are the eigenspaces of τ corresponding to the eigenvalues ±1. For
any a0 ∈A0 and a1 ∈A1, we have τ(a0 + a1)τ = a0 −a1. As above, associated
with the decomposition of A, we have a natural notion of parity. We say that an even
element a0 ∈A0 has parity |a0| = 0 and an odd element a1 ∈A1 has parity |a1| = 1.
Using this, one can endow A with the structure of a Lie superalgebra by deﬁning the
super-commutator as
[a, b]τ := a · b −(−1)|a||b|b · a .
For any trace-class operator a ∈A, the supertrace is deﬁned by
StrE (a) := Tr(τa) .
(5.8.6)
As above, we have
StrE (a) = Tr(a++) −Tr(a−−) ,
(5.8.7)
where a++ and a−−are the diagonal blocks of a with respect to the decomposition
(5.8.5). Moreover, for any odd element a, we have StrE (a) = 0. Finally,
StrE ([a, b]τ) = 0 ,
(5.8.8)
provided either a or b are of trace class (Exercise 5.8.1).
Now, recall from Remark 5.3.3 that any complex Cl(V, q)-module E is of the
form E ∼= Δn ⊗W, where W = HomCl(V,q)c(Δn, E), and
End(E) ∼= Cl(V, q)c ⊗EndCl(V,q)(E) .
(5.8.9)
Here, EndCl(V,q)(E) may be identiﬁed with End(W). Correspondingly, by Remark
5.5.4, locally we have E↾U ∼= S (U) ⊗W with W = HomCl(U)(S (U), E ) and
End(E↾U) ∼= Clc(U) ⊗EndCl(U)(E↾U) .
(5.8.10)
Thus, the supertrace strE boils down to the product of supertraces over the factors
on the right hand side of this equation. We write down the relevant notions on the
algebraic level of equation (5.8.9) and then extend them to E ﬁbrewise. To start with,
recall that the chirality element Γn of Clc
n, given by formula (5.3.8), endows Δn with

436
5
Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
a Z2-grading which is called the canonical grading of the spinor module. Let {ei} be
an orthonormal basis of V and, for each subset I ⊂In = {1, . . . , n}, let eI = 0 if
I = ∅and eI = ei1 . . . eik if I = {i1, . . . , ik} and i1 < . . . < ik. Then, with respect to
the canonical grading, we have
strΔn(eI) =

(−2i)
n
2
if I = In
0
otherwise
(5.8.11)
see Exercise 5.8.3. Then, for any a ∈Clc
n,
strΔn(a) = (−2i)
n
2 σ(a)↾[n] ,
where σ is the symbol mapping given by (5.1.10) and [n] means taking the n-form
part.45 Then, for any L = a ⊗F ∈End(E), we have
strE(L) = (−2i)
n
2 σ(a)↾[n] strW(F) .
(5.8.12)
This formula extends ﬁbrewise to E . Now, recall that on the bundle level a decompo-
sition E = S (M)⊗W holds in general only locally. To avoid such a decomposition
one introduces the following notion of relative supertrace. Since strΔn(Γn) = 2
n
2 , for
L = Γn ⊗F ∈Cl(V, q)c ⊗End(W), we obtain
strW(F) = 2−n
2 strE(L) .
Motivated by this formula, we deﬁne the relative supertrace of F ∈EndCl(V,q)(E) by
strE|Δn(F) := 2−n
2 strE(ΓnF) .
(5.8.13)
If W is ungraded, then
strE|Δn(F) = trW(F) = 2−n
2 trE(F) .
By analogy with (5.8.13), we deﬁne the relative supertrace on E ﬁbrewise by
strE |S (Am) := 2−n
2 strE (Γn(m)Am) ,
(5.8.14)
where Am ∈End(Em) and Γn(m) is the chirality element corresponding to vgm.
Now, let us consider the Dirac operator D of E . Since it anticommutes with τ, we
get a Fredholm complex
0 −→Γ ∞(E +)
D+
−→Γ ∞(E −) −→0 .
(5.8.15)
45We identify nV∗∼= R via the canonical volume form of q.

5.8 The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem
437
In this setting, D is referred to as a graded Dirac operator. As in the examples of the
previous section, the adjoint of D+ is D−: Γ ∞(E −) →Γ ∞(E +). Thus, according
to (5.7.44) and (5.7.16), the index of this complex is given by
ind(D) := dim(ker D+) −dim(ker D−) .
(5.8.16)
We are going to study ind(D) within the setting described above. For that purpose,
heat kernels are of basic importance.
Remark 5.8.2 (Heat kernels) Note that ψ(t) = e−tD2ψ0 is a solution to the heat
equation
∂ψ
∂t + D2ψ = 0
(5.8.17)
for any ψ0 ∈L2(E ). Therefore, e−tD2 will be called the heat operator. By stan-
dard arguments, for t > 0, ψ(t) is the unique smooth solution to (5.8.17) fulﬁlling
limt→0 ψ(t) = ψ0. Moreover,
lim
t→∞ψ(t) = Pker D(ψ0) ,
∥ψ(t) ∥≤∥ψ0 ∥,
where Pker D is the orthogonal projection onto ker D ⊂L2(E ), see Proposition 4.2.2
in [212]. It is easy to show that these statements also hold true for any ψ0 ∈Wk(E )
with k > 0. This implies that e−tD2 : L2(E ) →Wk(E ) is bounded for any t > 0 and
k ≥0. Thus, the Sobolev Lemma implies that
e−tD2 : L2(E ) →Γ ∞(E ) ,
t > 0 ,
is bounded. Such an operator is referred to as a smoothing operator. Moreover,
using the natural L2-pairing (5.7.11), one extends the heat operator to a bounded
mapping e−tD2 : W−k(E ) →L2(E ), for any t > 0 and k ≥0, and one shows that
e−tD2 : W−k(E ) →Γ ∞(E ) is smoothing, too, for any t > 0. Now, by the Schwartz
Kernel Theorem, e−tD2 admits a smooth kernel k, called the heat kernel of D2,

E ⊠E ∗:= p∗

2E ∗
is a vector bundle over M × M and kt is a smooth family of sections in E ⊠E ∗.
For an orthonormal basis {ψn} of L2(E ) consisting of eigensections of D2 with (non-
negative) eigenvalues λk, we have

Moreover, the heat kernel is the unique time-dependent section of E ⊠E ∗which is
of class C2 in p and q and of class C1 in t and which has the properties (a) and (b),
see [72, 533].
Finally, since D2 is smoothing and has a smooth kernel, e−tD2 is trace class for all
t > 0, see Theorem 8.12 in [533].
♦
In the ﬁrst step, we prove the following important formula [435].
Proposition 5.8.3 (McKean-Singer Formula) Let E be a graded Dirac bundle with
grading τ and let D be its Dirac operator. Then, for any t > 0,
ind(D) = StrE

e−tD2
.
(5.8.21)
Proof The assertion follows from the spectral theorem for the positive self-adjoint
operator D2. Clearly, the decomposition of D2 with respect to (5.8.1) is given by
D2 =
D−D+
0

D+D−

Let n±
λ be the dimensions of the λ-eigenspaces H±

Let ψ ∈H+
λ . Then, D+D−D+ψ = λD+ψ, that is, D+ψ ∈H−
λ is an eigenspinor ﬁeld
for D+D−with eigenvalue λ. Thus, for every λ ̸= 0, D+ maps H+
λ isomorphically
onto H−
λ . This implies n+
λ = n−
λ for any λ > 0. Consequently, only n+
0 −n−

dim(ker D+) −dim(ker D−) remains in the above sum.

♦
Example 5.8.5 (Heat kernel of the harmonic oscillator) Consider the Hamilton oper-
ator of the harmonic oscillator on R,
H = −d2
dt2 + ω2x2 .
Since this self-adjoint operator is quadratic both in differentiation and in multiplica-
tion, it is plausible to make the following ansatz:
kt(x, y) = ea(t) x2
2 +a(t) y2
2 +b(t)xy+c(t) .
Then, denoting the derivative with respect to t by a dot, we calculate
˙kt(x, y) + H kt(x, y)
=
&
˙a(t)x2

kt(x, y) ,
for any (t, x, y) ∈R+ × R × R. Thus, the heat equation implies
˙c = a ,
˙a = 2b2 = 2(a2 −ω2) .

Solving this system (Exercise 5.8.5) yields
a(t) = −coth(2(t −t0)),

sinh(2(t −t0)),
c(t) = −1

The next important observation is that the index is homotopy invariant. To show
this, let us consider a continuous family Ds, s ∈[0, 1], of graded Dirac operators on
a complex vector bundle E which means that all data (the Riemannian metric g, the
Clifford action c, the ﬁbre metric on E and the connection ∇) entering the deﬁnition of
D vary continuously with s preserving, of course, all compatibility conditions. Then,
s →Ds is a continuous mapping from [0, 1] to the space of bounded mappings
B(Wk+1(E ), Wk(E )) for any k, cf. (5.7.12).
Proposition 5.8.6 Let s →Ds be a continuous family of graded Dirac operators.
Then, ind(D0) = ind(D1).
Proof Since the heat kernel is smooth, formula (5.8.21) implies that ind(Ds) is a
smooth function of s. Thus, using Duhamel's Formula,46 we calculate

■
To summarize our discussion up until now, Proposition 5.8.6 shows that the index of
a graded Dirac operator D is a topological invariant and the McKean-Singer Formula
suggests that this invariant can possibly be calculated via the heat kernel of D2. It
turns out that this idea is fruitful indeed. It leads to one of the proofs of the index
theorem.47 Note that the left hand side of (5.8.22) does not depend on t whereas the
right hand side makes sense for all t > 0. This suggest that the limit of the right hand
side as t →0 may be meaningful and that it might be possible to use this limit for
calculating the index. Theorem 5.8.10 below substantiates this idea. To prove it, we
use the following approximation concept for heat kernels.
Deﬁnition 5.8.7 Let E be a Dirac bundle with Dirac operator D and let kt(p, q) be
the heat kernel of D2. Let k be a positive integer. Then, an approximate heat kernel
of order k is a smooth t-dependent section ˜kt(p, q) of E ⊠E ∗fulﬁlling the initial
condition (5.8.20) and
 ∂
∂t + D2

˜kt(p, q) = tkφt(p, q) ,
where φt is a Ck-section of E ⊠E ∗depending continuously on t for t ≥0 and where
Dp denotes the Dirac operator applied in the p-variable.
46See e.g. Sect.2.7 in [72] for a proof.
47For a comparison of the different proofs available, see [87].

5.8 The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem
441
By standard Sobolev-type arguments, see [533, Chap.7], one shows the following.
Lemma 5.8.8 Let E be a Dirac bundle with Dirac operator D and let kt(p, q) be
the heat kernel of D2. Then, for every k there exists a k′ ≥k such that for any
approximate heat kernel ˜kt(p, q) of order k′, we have
kt(p, q) −˜kt(p, q) = tkφt(p, q) ,
where φt is a Ck-section of E ⊠E ∗depending continuously on t for t ≥0.

In the sequel, Taylor expansions of geometric objects in a geodesic chart will be
used.
Remark 5.8.9 (Taylorexpansions)WetakeupRemarks1.7.19and2.1.30.Let(M, g)
be a Riemannian manifold and let x1, . . . , xn be normal coordinates of a geodesic
chart (U, κ) centered at m ∈M such that the local holonomic frame {∂i} is ortho-
normal at m. Construct a local synchronous frame e = (e1, . . . , en) on U for the
Levi-Civita connection on TM by parallel transporting the tangent space basis {∂j}
at m along the geodesics through m, cf. Remark 1.7.19. By construction, e is ortho-
normal and coincides with {∂i} at m. Thus, (1.7.17) implies
Γ k
il (x) ∼−1
2Rk
ijl(0)xj + 0(∥x∥2) ,
(5.8.26)
where Γ k
il are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection and Rk
ijl are
the components of the Riemann curvature in normal coordinates, respectively. In
particular, we have Γ k
il (0) = 0. A similar Taylor-type expansion holds for the metric:
gij(x) = δij −1


k,l
Riklj(0)xkxl + 0(∥x∥3) .
(5.8.27)
The proof of this formula is in complete analogy to the proof of (1.7.17). Let {θj} be
the coframe dual to e, let ωij be the components of the Levi-Civita connection in this
frame and let Xr = 
i xi∂i be the radial vector ﬁeld. Then,
Xr⌟θi = xi ,
Xr⌟ωi
j = 0 ,
gij dxi ⊗dxj = δijθi ⊗θj .
(5.8.28)
Clearly, the tautological form θ on M may be expressed with respect to both the
holonomic frame {∂j} and the synchronous frame {ej},
θ =

j
dxj∂j = θjej ,
and we may decompose θj = θjkdxk. Then, gij = δklθkiθlj. Thus, it is enough to ﬁnd
the Taylor expansion for the coefﬁcient functions θij. Using the relations (5.8.28),
by analogous arguments as in Remark 1.7.19, one obtains (Exercise 5.8.6)

♦
The basic idea is now to take the following counterpart of (5.8.23) on the Riemannian
manifold (M, g) as the ﬁrst approximation to the true heat kernel:
ht(p, q) := (4πt)−n
2 exp

−d(p, q)

,
(5.8.30)
where d(p, q) denotes the geodesic distance between p and q.
Theorem 5.8.10 (Heat kernel asymptotics) Let E be a Dirac bundle over a compact
Riemannian manifold (M, g) and let D be its Dirac operator. Let kt be the heat kernel
of D2. Then,
1. as t →0, there is an asymptotic expansion48
kt(p, q) ∼ht(p, q)
∞

j=0
tj aj(p, q) ,
(5.8.31)
where the aj are smooth sections of E ⊠E ∗. This expansion is valid in the Banach
space Cr(E ⊠E ∗) for any integer r ≥0.
2. The values aj(p, p) along the diagonal are given in terms of algebraic expres-
sions involving the metric and the connection coefﬁcients, together with their
derivatives. In particular, a0(p, p) is the identity endomorphism of E .
Our proof is along the lines of Theorem 7.15 in [533].
Proof By Lemma 5.8.8, it is enough to show that there exist smooth sections aj of
E ⊠E ∗such that for each k the partial sum
St(p, q) = ht(p, q)
J

j=0
tjaj(p, q)
is an approximate heat kernel of order k for all sufﬁciently large J. Since ht is of
order t∞outside any neighbourhood of the diagonal in M × M, it clearly sufﬁces
to determine the sections aj(p, q) for p near q. Thus, we may use a local geodesic
coordinate system x1, . . . , xn centered at q. We denote the determinant of the metric g
by g, the geodesic distance from q to p by r, that is, r2 = gijxixj. Then, one calculates,
see Exercise 5.8.7,
48Recall that f (t) ∼∞
k=0 ak(t) is called an asymptotic expansion for a function f on R+ if, for
any n, almost all the partial sums of the series approximate f to within an error of order tn. Clearly,
the series need not converge.

t, insert this expansion into (5.8.32) and put the coefﬁcient functions of each power

along each ray starting from q which may be solved recursively. Note that the ﬁrst
of these equations (j = 0) simply reads
∇∂

(5.8.34)
showing that φ0 is uniquely determined by its initial value φ0(0). We put φ0(0) = 1,
the identity endomorphism of Sq. This suggests to rewrite the remaining equations
by incorporating the factor g

(5.8.35)
for any j ≥1. Thus, every φj is determined by φj−1 up to an additive term of order
r−j near r = 0. If we require smoothness at r = 0, this term must vanish and, thus,
all φj are uniquely determined by the initial condition φ0(0) = 1.
To summarize, we have constructed local representatives φj(x) of the heat kernel
coefﬁcients aj(p, q) for p near q. By standard Sobolev-type arguments, one shows
that, for J > 1
2 dim M + k,
kJ
t (p, q) = ht(p, q)
J

j=0
tjaj(p, q)
is an approximate heat kernel of order k.
To prove the second assertion, note that aj(p, p) is given locally by φj(0). Thus, it
is enough to expand both sides of (5.8.33), or (5.8.35), in a Taylor series about the
origin. Then, the coefﬁcients φj(0) may be iteratively calculated in terms of algebraic
expressions involving the metric and the connection coefﬁcients, together with their
derivatives, indeed.
■
Example 5.8.11 To illustrate the second assertion in Theorem 5.8.10, let us ﬁnd
the ﬁrst two coefﬁcients of the heat kernel expansion. First, from (5.8.34) and the
initial condition, we read off φ0 = g−1
4 . Substituting this into (5.8.35) and using the
Weitzenboeck Formula 5.6.1 we obtain

(5.8.38)
Thus, the ﬁrst non-trivial heat kernel coefﬁcient is given by the scalar curvature of
(M, g) and by the Weitzenboeck curvature operator of the Dirac bundle E .
♦
Combining Theorem 5.8.10 with the McKean-Singer Formula in the form of
(5.8.22), we obtain the following.
Corollary 5.8.12 Let E be a graded Dirac bundle over a compact Riemannian
manifold (M, g) and let D be its Dirac operator. Then, the index of D is zero if the
dimension of M is odd. If n is even, then

Since the left hand side is constant, both assertions follow.
■
This corollary reduces the calculation of the index of D to the calculation of the
integral over the heat kernel coefﬁcient of D2 of order n
2.
For the further analysis of formula (5.8.39), let us ﬁx a point q ∈M and let
expq : TqM →M be the exponential mapping of (M, g). Then, for p = expq(X) in
a neighbourhood of q, we denote
kt(X) := kt(expq(X), q) ∈Hom

Eq, Eexpq(X)

.

5.8 The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem
445
We trivialize the bundle E over an open neighbourhood U centered at q by choosing
a synchronous framing combined with a local geodesic chart, cf. Remarks 1.7.19
and 5.8.9. In more detail, we choose a local geodesic chart (U, κ) centered at q and
identify the ﬁbres Eq and Eexpq(X) via the parallel transport operator along the radial
geodesic from q to expq(X). Clearly, the geodesic chart provides a local trivialization
of TM and, thus, of Cl(M) over U as well. Now, recall (5.8.10),
End(E↾U) ∼= Clc(U) ⊗EndCl(U)(E↾U) .
(5.8.40)
In the above local trivializations, the Clifford action boils down to the action of
Cl(TqM) on the ﬁbre Eq and, thus, EndCl(M)(E ) is locally trivial as well, with ﬁbre
EndCl(TqM)(Eq) = End(W). Thus, for a chosen point q ∈M, we may view the heat
kernel as
kt(X) ∈End(Eq) ∼= Clc(TqM) ⊗End(W) .
(5.8.41)
Let x1, . . . , xn be the normal coordinates of the chosen geodesic chart and let {∂j}
and {ej} be the holonomic and the (orthonormal) synchronous frames, respectively.
Recall that the latter coincide at the point q. In these normal coordinates, we will
write kt(x) for kt(X). Let {ei} be the orthonormal basis of TqM given by ei = ei(q).
Moreover, as before, for each subset I ⊂In = {1, . . . , n}, let eI = 0 if I = ∅and
eI = ei1 . . . eik if I = {i1, . . . , ik} and i1 < · · · < ik. In this basis, (5.8.31) takes the

C∞(U, End(W)) are functions of order 0(∥x∥).

(5.8.47)
is the curvature endomorphism of ∇g viewed as a connection in the Clifford bundle
Cl(M)↾U and F E ∈Ω2(U, End(W)) is the twisting curvature of the Dirac bundle
E . Since, at the origin, ei and ∂i coincide, the contribution of R∇g coincides with the
ﬁrst term in (5.8.45) up to a term of order 0(∥x∥2). Since the Clifford action on W is
trivial, the contribution of F E is simply a function of order 0(∥x∥).
■
Now, we are prepared to prove the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem. The proof
we give is based on a method developed by Getzler [242, 243], which is often
referred to as Getzler rescaling.49 By (5.5.5), Cl(M) and T∗M may be identiﬁed as
Clifford module bundles. In our trivialization, this boils down to the Clifford module
isomorphism
T∗
qM ∼= Cl(T∗
qM) ,
(5.8.48)
with the left Clifford action on T∗
qM given by c(α) = ε(α) + ι(α), cf. Example
5.3.2. Now, given a function φ on R+ × U with values in T∗
qM ⊗End(W), we
deﬁne the Getzler rescaling operator by
(δλφ)(t, x) :=
n

j=0
λ−jφ

λ2t, λx

[j] ,
(5.8.49)
for 0 < λ ≤1. Here, the index [j] means restriction to the form degree j. This implies
the rescaling ˆδλA := δλAδ−1
λ for any operator A acting on functions of the above type.
In particular, we obtain
ˆδλ∂t = λ−2∂t , ˆδλ∂j = λ−1∂j , ˆδλε(α) = λ−1ε(α) , ˆδλι(α) = λι(α) ,
(5.8.50)
for α ∈T∗
qM. We will write εi = ε(dxi) and ιi = gij ι(∂j).
49We use the Getzler calculus in a purely operational manner. For a deeper discussion we refer to
[72, 533].

5.8 The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem
447
As a last ingredient, we need the relative Chern character form of the bundle E .
It is deﬁned as follows. The twisting curvature endomorphism F E of ∇is a 2-form
with values in the real vector bundle
uClc(M)(E ) := u(E ) ∩EndClc(M)(E ) ,
where u(E ) ⊂End(E ) is the subbundle of skew-adjoint endomorphisms, see
Sect.4.6. For Am ∈uClc(M)(E ), one has eiAm/4π ∈EndClc(M)(Em), so that one can
deﬁne a section qE in the bundle FPS

uClc(M)(E )

of formal power series, see
Sect.4.6, by
qE
m(Am) := strE |S (exp(−Am/4πi)) ,
m ∈M .
(5.8.51)
By deﬁnition, the relative Chern character form of E is
ch(E |S ) := hFE (qE ) ,
with hFE given by (4.6.33). One easily shows that this form is closed and that its de
Rham cohomology class, which we denote by the same symbol, does not depend on
the choice of the connection, see Sect.3 in [526]. According to Remark 4.6.10, we
write
ch(E |S ) = strE |S

exp(−FE /2πi)

.
(5.8.52)
Theorem 5.8.14 (Atiyah-Singer) Let E be a graded Dirac bundle over an even-
dimensional oriented compact Riemannian manifold (M, g) and let D be its Dirac
operator. Then,
ind D =
 
M
ˆA(M) ∧ch(E |S ) ,
(5.8.53)
where ˆA(M) is the ˆA-genus form of M. In the integrand, the component of form degree
dim M is taken.
Proof Let dim M = n. We deﬁne the rescaled heat kernel by
kλ
t (x) := λn(δλk)t(x) .
(5.8.54)
Since the heat kernel satisﬁes the heat equation, we have
(∂t + λ2δλD2δ−1
λ )kλ
t = 0 .
Thus, kλ
t is the heat kernel of the rescaled operator Pλ := λ2 ˆδλD2. In the ﬁrst step,
we prove that the limit P0 = limλ→0 Pλ exists by explicitly calculating it. For that
purpose, we work in the local trivialization of E over a neighbourhood U centered
at q obtained by the above described synchronous framing. By the Weitzenboeck
Formula (5.6.9),

D2 = ∇∗∇+ 1

(5.8.55)

∇ei∇ej −∇∇ei ej

.
In the synchronous frame, ∇∂i = ∂i + Ai with Ai given by (5.8.45). In order to
be able to apply the rescaling mappings, we must consistently use the isomorphism
(5.8.48). Then, using the fact that the Clifford action on W is trivial, we obtain

obtain

qM which is a ﬁnite-dimensional commutative algebra (over C) with unit. By the
above arguments, the limit λ →0 of the covariant derivative exists and is equal to
∂i + 1
4

j Ωijxj . Next, using the Taylor expansions for gij and Γ k
ij derived in Remark
5.8.9, we see that the second and the third term in (5.8.56) vanish in the limit λ →0.
Finally, by (5.6.10), the limit of the last term is simply F E (0). Using the Taylor
expansion of gij once again, we obtain

Under the identiﬁcation (5.8.48), F E (0) becomes an element of A ⊗End(W) acting

This is the Hamiltonian of a generalized harmonic oscillator. Then, by the above
discussion, P0 = H + F is a differential operator acting on A ⊗End(W)-valued
functions on U. Since A is commutative, the operators H and F commute. Thus,
e−tP0 = e−tHe−tF. Since Ω is an antisymmetric (n × n)-matrix with values in the
2-forms we can choose the orthonormal basis in TqM so that Ω is represented by a

and it remains to calculate the heat kernel of this operator. By the uniqueness of the
heat kernel, we can seek a rotationally invariant solution. Then, the last term in h
will not contribute and, apart from the fact that we must replace ω by iω, we have a
sum of two harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians. Using Mehler's Formula (5.8.25), we

the rescaled heat kernel kλ

Often, the right hand side of (5.8.53) is referred to as the topological index of the
Dirac bundle. In this language, the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem states that the
analytical index of a Dirac operator is equal to the topological index of its Dirac
bundle.
Remark 5.8.15 (Local Index Theorem) Note that in the proof of Theorem 5.8.14 we
have actually obtained a much stronger result which is usually referred to as the
Local Index Theorem: for every q ∈M, the limit limt→0 strEqkt(q, q)vg(q) exists
and is given by

Remark 5.8.16 (Family Index Theorem) Both the Index Theorem 5.8.14 and the
Local Index Theorem generalize to the case of families of Dirac operators [40, Part
IV]. It turns out that the heat kernel methods developed above may be extended to
this situation in a quite straightforward way. This has been shown by Bismut [78],

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
see also Chap.10 in [72] for a detailed presentation. Here, we only explain the setting
and formulate the result.50
Consider a smooth ﬁbre bundle π : M →Y , where M and Y are compact
connected manifolds of dimensions n + m and m, respectively, with n even. That is,
π is a smooth mapping and for every open subset U ⊂Y the inverse image π−1(U)
is diffeomorphic to U ×X, where X is an n-dimensional compact manifold.51 Denote
the bundle of vertical vectors on M with respect to the ﬁbre structure by VM. Assume
that the ﬁbration π : M →Y is endowed with the following additional structures:
(a) a ﬁbre metric gV,
(b) a projection P : TM →VM,
(c) a Spin(n)-structure S(VM) →M on the vertical bundle VM.
By points (a) and (b), we have a canonical connection ∇V on VM deﬁned as follows.
First note that the kernel of P deﬁnes a horizontal distribution on M and, thus, a
splitting TM = VM ⊕ker P, that is, P deﬁnes a connection in π : M →Y. Now,
take any metric gY on Y, lift it to ker P and combine this lift with gV to a Riemannian
metric gM on M. Take its Levi-Civita connection ∇M and project it to VM,
∇V := P ∇M P .
It is easy to show that this is a connection on VM which does not depend on the choice
of gY. Moreover, the restrictions of this connection to the ﬁbres of π coincide with
the Levi-Civita connections on the ﬁbres. To summarize, VM carries the structure of
a Hermitean vector bundle with a connection which is compatible with the metric.
Next, by point (c), VM admits a spin structure S(VM) and, thus, the connection
∇V naturally lifts to a connection on S(VM). By construction, for every y ∈Y,
the restriction of this connection to S(VM)↾My coincides with the spin connection
corresponding to the Levi-Civita connection of the ﬁbre metric gV.
Now, assume we are given a Clifford module bundle E over the Clifford bundle
Cl(VM). Since VM carries a spin structure, E has the form
E = SV ⊗E ,
(5.8.67)
where SV is a spinor bundle associated with S(VM) and E is a vector bundle given
by E = HomCl(VM)(SV, E ). The spinor bundle may be viewed as a tensor product
SV = S ⊗V ρ,whereS isthecanonicalspinorbundle,ρ isacomplexrepresentation
of Spin(n) and V ρ is the corresponding vector bundle associated with S(VM). Since
n is even, the natural splitting of S induces a splitting of SV into the chirality
components S ±
V . The natural spin connection on S(VM) induces connections on the
bundles S ±
V . As usual, we assume that E carries a Hermitean ﬁbre metric gE and a
50For the very formulation of the result, a shorthand version of the detailed description below would
be sufﬁcient. However, we present the full structure which then may be taken as the starting point
for reading the proof of Bismut.
51Then, π : M →Y may be viewed as associated with a principal Diff(X)-bundle over Y.

5.8 The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem

compatible connection ∇E. By (5.8.67), the twisting curvature of E simply coincides
with the curvature of ∇E.
Given the above described structures, we obtain a family of Dirac bundles

with an associated family of Dirac operators Dy : C∞

. Using the
bundle metric in E ±
y and the natural volume form on My, we obtain L2-completions
H±
y of the above C∞-spaces. The latter ﬁt together to continuous52 Hilbert bundles
H± →Y. Correspondingly, the Dirac operators combine to a bundle mapping D :
H+ →H−. In this context, one can prove a Local Index Theorem for the Dirac
family D and, as a corollary one obtains the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem for D:
ch(Ind(D)) =
 
M/Y
ˆA(VM) ch(E) .
(5.8.68)
Here, ch(Ind(D)) is the Chern character of the index bundle, see Appendix E, ˆA(VM)
is the ˆA-genus of the bundle VM for the connection ∇V and ch(E) is the Chern
character form of the bundle E. The symbol
(
M/Y means integration over the ﬁbres
of π : M →Y.
♦
In the literature, there can be found many generalized index theorems, e.g. alge-
braic index theorems for formal deformation quantizations, see [190, 483, 511] and
references therein. It is interesting to note, see [484], that an application of the alge-
braic index theorem to the case of the cotangent bundle endowed with the canonical
symplectic form and the deformation quantization given by the asymptotic pseudo-
differential calculus reproduces the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem.

Applications
In this section, we discuss some consequences of the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem.
The reader can ﬁnd a lot of further applications in Chap. IV of [407].
To start with, the following is an immediate consequence of Theorem 5.8.14.
Corollary 5.9.1 (Atiyah-Singer) If M is a spin manifold and E is the canonical
spinor bundle, then the index of the Dirac operator D/ coincides with the ˆA-genus
of M.
This implies:
(a) the index of the Dirac operator does not depend on the spin structure.
(b) the ˆA-genus of a spin manifold is an integer.
Point (b) may be sharpened as follows.
Proposition 5.9.2 Let M be a compact spin manifold such that dim M = 4 mod 8.
Then, ˆA(M) is an even integer.
Proof By Theorem 5.3.19, for n = 4 mod 8 the spinor representations Δn are of
quaternionic type. By Remark 5.3.20, the corresponding structure mappings C :
Δn →Δn commute with the Clifford multiplication and are Spin(n)-equivariant.
The same is true for the structure mappings C± : Δ±
n →Δ±
n of the corresponding
irreducible components of Δn. Now, the Spin(n)-equivariance
C ◦γ (g) = γ (g) ◦C ,
(5.9.1)
for any g ∈Spin(n), implies that C may be extended to a ﬁbre-preserving mapping
of the spinor bundle which we denote by the same letter. Differentiating (5.9.1), we
obtain that C commutes with the covariant derivative of the spin connection,
∇X ◦C = C ◦∇X ,

5.9 Applications
455
for any X ∈X(M). This property, together with the fact that C commutes with the
Clifford multiplication, implies that the Dirac operator commutes with C. Corre-
spondingly, we have D/ + ◦C+ = C−◦D/ +. Thus, the kernel and the cokernel of D/ +
are quaternionic vector spaces and, consequently, their complex dimension is even.
■
Combining Corollary 5.9.1 with Bochner-type arguments, we obtain the following.
Proposition 5.9.3 (Lichnerowicz) Let M be a compact spin manifold admitting a
metric of strictly positive scalar curvature. Then, the ˆA-genus of M must vanish.
Proof By point 1 of Corollary 5.6.8, ker D/ = ker D/ 2 = 0. Since
ker D/ = ker D/ + ⊕ker D/ −,
this implies ind D/ = ˆA(M) = 0,
■
Next, we turn to the analysis of the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem for the Dirac
bundle
E = Clc(M) ∼=
T∗M ⊗C .
This is a left Cl(M)-module bundle with the Clifford mapping of Cl(M) given by
c : TM →End(T∗M) ,
c(X)α = g(X) ∧α + X⌟α ,
cf. formula (5.1.8). Its Dirac operator is induced from the de Rham complex EdR(M)
and is given by
Dα = i(d −d∗)α ,
see Examples 5.5.16 and 5.7.22. Recall that the index of the de Rham complex
coincides with the Euler characteristic χ(M).
Now, let us analyze the right-hand side of (5.8.53) for that case. Since
V ∗⊗C ∼= Clc(V) = End(Δn) ∼= Δ∗
n ⊗Δn ,
for any even-dimensional vector space V, the typical ﬁbre of E is E = Δn ⊗Δ∗
n,
that is, the twisting vector space is W = Δ∗
n. Note that, in this situation, besides the
canonical grading τ0 = Γn ⊗id we have a grading τ = ωn ⊗ωn given by the volume
form ωn = eIn of Cln. Clearly, this is the natural grading induced from that on V ∗.
So, we are going to consider this grading here.
Recall that the Euler form of an oriented Riemannian manifold M is deﬁned by
e(M) := e(TM).
Lemma 5.9.4 The following holds.
ˆA(M) ∧ch(E |S ) = e(M) .

Clifford Algebras, Spin Structures and Dirac Operators
Proof Let R and R! denote the curvature endomorphism forms of the Levi-Civita
connections on TM and T∗M ⊗C, respectively, and let o(TM) ⊂End(TM) denote
the subbundle of skew-symmetric endomorphisms. By (4.7.17), ˆA(M) = hR(rM),
where rM is the section in FPS

m (Am) := pf
Am

.
By formula (5.8.52), ch(E |S ) = hF E (q!), where F E is the twisting curvature
endomorphism form of the Levi-Civita connection on T∗M ⊗C and q! is the
section in FPS

uClc(M)(E )

deﬁned by (5.8.51). To prove the assertion, it sufﬁces to
show
hR(rM) ∧hF E (q!) = hR(εM) .
(5.9.2)
For that purpose, we rewrite hF E in terms of hR. First, to calculate F E , we choose a
local orthonormal frame {ei} in TM. According to (2.7.36), in this frame the curvature
endomorphism form of the Levi-Civita connection on T∗M ⊗C is given by
R!(ei, ej) = −g(R(ei, ej)ek, el)εkιl .
(5.9.3)
Let ci and bi denote the local sections in End(Clc(M)) deﬁned ﬁbrewise by Clifford
multiplication by ei from the left and the right, respectively. Clearly, the bi take values
in EndClc(M)(E ). Under the isomorphism with T∗M ⊗C,
ci = ε(ei) + ι(ei) ,
bi = ε(ei) −ι(ei) .
(5.9.4)
Using
cicj + cjci = 2δij ,
bibj + bjbi = −2δij
(5.9.5)
(Exercise 5.9.1) and the symmetry properties of the curvature, we obtain
R!(ei, ej) = −1
4 g

R(ei, ej)ek, el

(ckcl −bkbl) .
Since the ﬁrst summand coincides with (5.8.47), the Weitzenboeck Formula yields
F E = 1
4 g(R ek, el)bkbl .
(5.9.6)
According to (5.2.29), then
F E = ρ ◦ϕ ◦R ,

5.9 Applications
457
where ϕ : o(TM) →Cl2(M) is the vertical vector bundle isomorphism which
is ﬁbrewise deﬁned by (5.2.28) and ρ : Cl2(M) →uClc(M)(Clc(M)) is the vertical
vector bundle morphism assigning to ξ ∈Cl2(TmM) the endomorphism of Clc(TmM)
deﬁned by right multiplication by ξ. By Lemma 4.6.18/2, then
hF E (q!) = hR(q! ◦ρ ◦ϕ) .
Plugging this into (5.9.2) and using that hR is an algebra homomorphism, we ﬁnd
that it sufﬁces to show
rM · (q! ◦ρ ◦ϕ) = εM .
Fibrewise, this boils down to the assertion that the identity53

V. Via this isomorphism,
left multiplication by ΓV corresponds to γ (ΓV) ⊗idΔ∗
V , the endomorphism b1b2
corresponds to idΔV ⊗γ T(e1e2) and the involution corresponds to
γ (e1e2) ⊗γ T(e1e2) = −γ (ΓV) ⊗γ T(ΓV) .
Writing strΔV and strΔ∗
V for the supertrace on ΔV and Δ∗
V deﬁned by the canonical
involutions γ (ΓV) and γ T(ΓV), respectively, we thus obtain

It follows that the left hand side of (5.9.7) equals x. This coincides with pf(A).

This Lemma implies the following classical theorem.
Theorem 5.9.5 (Gauß-Bonnet) The Euler characteristic of an even-dimensional
oriented manifold M is given by
χ(M) =
 
M
e(M) .
(5.9.12)
■
More generally, let us consider the de Rham complex twisted with a complex vector
bundle E over M, denoted by EdR(M, E). By the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem and
by Lemma 5.9.4, we have
ind

EdR(M, E)

=
 
M
ch(E) ∧e(M) .

5.9 Applications
459
Since e(M) is of top degree, we conclude
ind

EdR(M, E)

= rank(E) χ(M) .
(5.9.13)
By analogy with Theorem 5.9.5, one can derive the following classical theorems
corresponding to the elliptic complexes discussed in Examples 5.7.23 and 5.7.25.
For the signature complex one obtains the following.
Theorem 5.9.6 (Hirzebruch) Let M be an oriented Riemannian manifold of dimen-
sion divisible by 4. Then, the signature of M is given by
σ(M) =
 
M
L(M) ,
(5.9.14)
where L is the L-genus of the manifold.54
■
As an application, consider the case dim M = 4. In view of (4.7.11), the Hirzebruch
Signature Theorem implies
σ(M) = 1
3p1(M) .
Moreover, by (4.7.15),
ˆA(M) = −1
24p1(M) .
Thus,
σ(M) = −8ˆA(M) .
(5.9.15)
Since, on a spin manifold, the ˆA-genus is an integer, this implies that on a compact
4-dimensional spin manifold, the signature is divisible by 8. Combining this with
Proposition 5.9.2, we obtain the following classical theorem of Rohlin [535].
Theorem 5.9.7 (Rohlin) The signature of a compact 4-dimensional spin manifold
is divisible by 16.
■
More generally, let us consider the signature complex twisted with a vector bundle
E, denoted by Esgn(M, E). As for the de Rham complex, it is easy to calculate its
index. One obtains

Esgn(M, E)

Chapter 6
The Yang-Mills Equation
In this chapter we study pure gauge theories. In Sect.6.1, we present the geometric
model of gauge theory including the basics concerning the structure of the classi-
cal conﬁguration space. Next, in Sect.6.2, we formulate the action functional and
show that (anti-)self-dual solutions correspond to absolute minima of the Yang-Mills
action. Sections6.3, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6 are devoted to a systematic study of instan-
tons. First, we present the BPST-instanton family in detail, including the topological
description and a detailed discussion of the role of the conformal invariance of the
Yang-Mills equation. Next, we present the famous ADHM-construction providing
solutions on S4 with arbitrary instanton number. We limit our attention to the gauge
group G = Sp(1) and only comment on solutions for the other classical groups.
The proof that the ADHM-construction yields all instanton solutions is highly non-
trivial. Roughly speaking, it goes as follows: ﬁrst, one reinterprets the ADHM data
in terms of complex geometry on the twistor space CP3 and, using these complex
data, one applies the Horrocks construction yielding algebraic vector bundles over
CP3 of a certain type. Second, by deep results of algebraic geometry, all algebraic
vector bundles of this type arise from the Horrocks construction. Third, one uses the
Atiyah-Ward correspondence to complete the proof. While we discuss points 1 and
3in detail, point 2 is beyond the scope of this book. Finally, we study the instanton
moduli space and we outline how it is used for the study of the topology of differ-
entiable 4-manifolds. In Sect.6.7, we present the classical stability analysis of the
Yang-Mills equation as developed by Bourguignon and Lawson and, in Sect.6.8, we
discuss non-minimal solutions.

Gauge Fields. The Conﬁguration Space
A classical pure Yang-Mills theory consists of the following structural elements.
(a) The theory is deﬁned on a principal ﬁbre bundle (P, M, G, Ψ, π) called the gauge
principal bundle. Here, the base manifold M represents the spacetime and the

The Yang-Mills Equation
structure group G plays the role of the gauge group. In the sequel, G will always
be compact.
(b) A gauge potential mediating the fundamental interaction under consideration is
given by a connection form ω on P and the ﬁeld strength is given by the curvature
form Ω of ω. These objects are related by the Structure Equation (1.4.9) and Ω
fulﬁls the Bianchi identity (1.4.10),
Ω = dω + 1
2[ω, ω] ,
DωΩ = 0 .
Any local section s: U →π−1(U) provides a local representation of ω and Ω,
respectively, in terms of objects on M,
A = s∗ω ,
F = s∗Ω .
(6.1.1)
By Proposition 1.3.11, Corollary 1.3.12 and Remark 1.4.15/1, ω and Ω may be
reconstructed from any system of local representatives A and F corresponding
to a chosen bundle atlas of P.
(c) An active local gauge transformation is given by a vertical automorphism ϑ ∈
AutM(P) with corresponding equivariant mapping u ∈HomG(P, G),
ϑ∗ω = Ad(u−1) ◦ω + u∗θ ,
ϑ∗Ω = Ad(u−1) ◦Ω ,
(6.1.2)
cf. Proposition 1.8.7 and Remark 1.8.8/1. Below, for simplicity, we will write
ϑ∗ω = ω(u) .
By Remark 1.8.8/2, for local representatives A and F of ω and Ω, respectively,
one has
A (ρ) = Ad(ρ−1) ◦A + ρ∗θ ,
F (ρ) = Ad(ρ−1) ◦F ,
(6.1.3)
where ρ = u ◦s. By (1.3.15) and (1.4.19), the latter formulae may also be
interpreted passively, that is, as transformations corresponding to a change of a
local trivialization of P.
Remark 6.1.1 Usually, in this book, local gauge potentials A are written down in
'geometrical units', that is, their components have the unit of inverse length. In
physics, especially in quantum ﬁeld theory, it is often relevant to make the coupling
constant e of the gauge theory under consideration transparent. Moreover, physicists
often choose a system of units where c = 1 = ℏand they prefer to work with
Hermitean quantities. Then, the gauge potential A must be replaced by ieA . We
call the latter a physical representation and we will refer to it in some places. Note
that, in this representation, not the physical representative A itself but ieA is the
local representative of a connection form. Sometimes, the choice c = 1 = ℏis not

convenient. Then, in the CGS system, ieA should be replaced by ie
ℏcA and in the SI
system it should be replaced by ie
ℏA , respectively.

Intheremainderofthissection,weintroducetheconﬁgurationspaceandweconstruct
the action functional for Yang-Mills theory. For these purposes, we apply the notions
and structures discussed in Sect.2.7 to the case E = Ad(P), that is, we endow the
adjoint bundle with the structure of a Riemannian vector bundle. To do so, from now
on we assume:
1. thespacetimemanifoldM isendowedwithaRiemannianorapseudo-Riemannian
metric g,
2. the Lie algebra g of G carries an Ad(G)-invariant inner product ⟨·, ·⟩g.1
Then, ⟨·, ·⟩g induces via (2.6.4) a ﬁbre metric on Ad(P) and, via formula (2.7.48),
we have an L2-inner product2 on Ωk(M, Ad(P)),
⟨α, β⟩L2 =

(6.1.4)
Next, consider a connection form ω on P and its covariant exterior derivative
dω : Ωp(M, Ad(P)) →Ωp+1(M, Ad(P)), cf. Deﬁnition 1.5.1. Given the above
L2-structure, we may deﬁne the covariant exterior coderivative
d∗
ωα : Ωp+1(M, Ad(P)) →Ωp(M, Ad(P))
via (2.7.51),
⟨dωα, β⟩L2 = ⟨α, d∗

and the generalized Hodge-Laplacian, cf. (2.7.52),
□ω := dω ◦d∗
ω + d∗
ω ◦dω : Ωp(M, Ad(P)) →Ωp(M, Ad(P)) .
(6.1.6)
Now, let us discuss the conﬁguration space of a Yang-Mills theory. By Remark
1.3.8, the set of connections C on a principal ﬁbre bundle P carries the structure of
an inﬁnite-dimensional afﬁne space with the corresponding translation vector space
given by
T = Ω1(M, Ad(P)) ∼= Ω1

This space will be referred to as the classical conﬁguration space of the gauge ﬁeld

1Note that such an inner product always exists if G is compact. In that case, it may be obtained
from any auxiliary inner product by averaging over the group with respect to the Haar measure. In
many applications, the gauge group G is compact and semisimple. Then, for ⟨·, ·⟩g one can choose
the negative of the Killing form k. Compactness implies that −k is positive-deﬁnite, cf. Sect.5.5 of
Volume I.
2We must restrict ourselves to square integrable forms. In particular, we may consider forms with
compact support.

automorphisms AutM(P). This group will be denoted by G and will be referred to as
the group of local gauge transformations. Note that (6.1.2) deﬁnes a right action. If
necessary, one can pass to a left action by viewing gauge transformations as mappings
ω 
→(ϑ−1)∗ω.
Remark 6.1.2 Depending on the context, G will be viewed as HomG(P, G) or, equiv-
alenty, as the space of sections of the associated bundle P ×G G, cf. Sect.1.8. There
is yet another useful point of view. Note that the adjoint action of G induces a bundle
mapping
Φ : P ×G G →End(Ad(P)) ,
Φ([(p, g)])([(p, X)]) := [(p, Ad(g)X)] ,
whose kernel coincides with the center of G . Clearly, this deﬁnition does not depend
on the choice of the representative of [(p, X)] ∈Ad(P). This shows that local gauge
transformations may be viewed as sections of the vector bundle End(Ad(P)). Then,
(6.1.2) may be rewritten as follows:
ω(u) = ω + u−1∇ωu .
(6.1.8)
♦
In the sequel, for many purposes, it will be necessary to pass to a Sobolev completion
of C and G .3 In this way, C will become an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert manifold and
G an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert-Lie group. To be able to deﬁne such a completion,
weassumethat G beacompactconnectedlinearLiegroup.Moreover,inplaceswhere
the Sobolev completion is essential, we will deal with the case of M being a compact
connected orientable Riemannian manifold. So, we also make this assumption here.
We stress, however, that Sobolev completions for noncompact manifolds exist as
well, see the work of Eichhorn [178] and Eichhorn and Heber [179]. For any vector
bundle E, let W k(E) denote the Hilbert space of cross sections of E of Sobolev class
k, cf. (5.7.8). We denote
Ωp
k (M, Ad(P)) := W kpT∗M ⊗Ad(P)

.
These spaces are endowed with the natural L2-inner product (6.1.4). In this Hilbert
space setting, the translation vector space T is deﬁned as
T = Ω1
k (M, Ad(P))
(6.1.9)
and the conﬁguration space C is deﬁned as the completion with respect to the metric
induced from the W k-norm on T . In this way, C becomes an afﬁne Hilbert space
with translation Hilbert space T . In particular,
TC = C × T .
(6.1.10)
3For basics of the theory of Sobolev spaces, we refer to Sect.5.7.

Remark 6.1.3 In the sequel, as usual, the tangent space to C at a point ω ∈C will
be identiﬁed with the translation vector space,
TωC = T .
(6.1.11)
However, one may also consider the afﬁne tangent space ω + T .
♦
To turn G into a Hilbert Lie group, we choose an n such that G ⊂gl(n, C) and take
the associated vector bundle
P ×G gl(n, C) ,
where G acts on gl(n, C) by conjugation. Then, P ×G G is a vertical subbundle of
P ×G gl(n, C) and, hence,
Γ ∞(P ×G G) ⊂Γ ∞(P ×G gl(n, C)) .
By deﬁnition, G is the closure of Γ ∞(P ×G G) in W k+1(P ×G gl(n, C)).
We will assume k > dim(M)/2+1. Then, the Sobolev Lemma 5.7.7 ensures that
multiplication of a W k+1-function by a W l-function, where dim(M)/2 < l ≤k ,
yields a W l-function. It follows that G is a group, acting via (6.1.2) on C . Note that
the elements of C and G are of class C1 and C2, respectively. In particular, G may
be viewed as consisting of vertical automorphisms of P of class C2 or of sections of
class C2 of the associated bundles P ×G G or End(Ad(P)), respectively, cf. Remark
6.1.2. In fact, one can prove that G is a Hilbert-Lie group with Lie algebra
LG = W k+1(Ad(P))
(6.1.12)
and exponential mapping
expG (ξ)(p) = expG(ξ(p)) ,
ξ ∈LG , p ∈P ,
(6.1.13)
and that the G -action on C is smooth [455], [478], [591]. Many properties of ﬁnite-
dimensional Lie groups carry over to inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert Lie groups, see
[92].
Next, we extend the covariant exterior derivative dω to an operator
dω : Ωp
k+1(M, Ad(P)) →Ωp+1
k
(M, Ad(P)) ,
and its dual to
d∗
ω : Ωp+1

Composition then yields bounded linear operators

is continuous linear and, hence, smooth. The same is true for the mapping ω

ω.
Hence, the mappings
ω 
→Δω ,
ω 
→□ω ,
are continuous and smooth, because they factorize into continuous linear mappings.
Moreover, we note the following equivariance properties:
Oω(u) = Ad(u−1) ◦Oω ◦Ad(u) ,
ω ∈C , u ∈G ,
(6.1.15)
where O stands for, respectively, d, d∗, Δ and □.
In sharp contrast to Maxwell theory, in a Yang-Mills theory the conﬁguration
space C acquires a nontrivial stratiﬁed structure under the action of G . This structure
will be investigated in detail in Chap.8. As we know from Part I, the orbit types
constituting the stratiﬁcation are labeled by conjugacy classes of stabilizers of the
group action. Thus, let us ﬁnd the stabilizer
Gω := {u ∈G : ω(u) = ω}
of ω ∈C with respect to the action of G . It turns out that Gω is determined by the
holonomy of ω. Thus, recall the deﬁnitions4 of the holonomy group Hp0(ω) and of
the holonomy bundle Pp0(ω) of a connection ω based at p0 ∈P. Note that, in the
Sobolev context, Pp0(ω) is a vertical subbundle of class C2, because ω is C1.
Lemma 6.1.4 Let p0 ∈P and ω ∈C . Then, for u ∈G , one has u ∈Gω iff the
restriction of u to Pp0(ω) is constant.
Proof Let γ : [0, 1] →P be an ω-horizontal curve starting at p0. Then,
(a) for every u ∈G , the curve ϑu ◦γ is ω(u)-horizontal and starts at ϑu(p0),
(b) for every g ∈G, the curve Ψg ◦γ is ω-horizontal and starts at Ψg(p0).
First, let u ∈Gω. Then ω(u) = ω and hence ϑu ◦γ is ω-horizontal. By uniqueness of
the horizontal lift, it must then coincide with the curve Ψu(p0) ◦γ , because the latter
is also ω-horizontal, starts at ϑu(p0) = Ψu(p0)(p0) and projects to the same curve in
M. Thus, for all t,

and hence u(γ (t)) = u(p0). This shows that u is constant on Pp0(ω).
Conversely, if u is constant on Pp0(ω), it is constant along all ω-horizontal curves
γ starting at p0. Then, ϑu ◦γ = Ψu(p0) ◦γ . It follows that ω(u)-horizontal curves are
also ω-horizontal and vice versa. This implies ω(u) = ω.
■
Theorem 6.1.5 (Stabilizer Theorem) Gω is a compact Lie subgroup of G with Lie
algebra given by
LGω = ker(∇ω) = {ξ ∈LG : ξ↾Pp0(ω) = const} .
(6.1.16)
Gω is isomorphic to CG(Hp0(ω)), the centralizer of the holonomy group in G.
Proof By Lemma 6.1.4,
Gω = {u ∈G : u↾Pp0(ω) = const} .
(6.1.17)
Let ξ ∈LG . Then, ∇ωξ = 0 iff ξ↾Pp0(ω) = const, that is, iff expG (ξ)↾Pp0(ω) = const.
The second equivalence follows from (6.1.13). Thus,
expG (LG ) ∩Gω = expG (ker(∇ω)) .
Since ker(∇ω) is a closed subspace of the Hilbert space LG , the right hand side is a
submanifold of G . Since the left hand side is a neighbourhood of the unit element
of Gω, it follows that Gω is a Lie subgroup of G with Lie algebra given by (6.1.16).
The argument is analogous to the ﬁnite-dimensional case, see [92, Sect. III.1.3].
Next, consider the natural group homomorphism
Φp0 : G →G ,
u 
→u(p0) .
Since, by our choice of k, convergence in W k+1 implies pointwise convergence, Φp0
is a continuous Lie group homomorphism and, hence, smooth. Due to (6.1.17), the
restriction of Φp0 to the subgroup Gω is injective, hence, a Lie group isomorphism
onto its image. The image is
Φp0(Gω) = CG(Hp0(ω)) .
To see this, recall that Hp0(ω) is the structure group of Pp0(ω). Thus, inclusion from
left to right is due to equivariance of the elements of G . For the converse inclusion it
sufﬁces to note that, for any a ∈CG(Hp0(ω)), the function on Pp0(ω) with constant
value a is equivariant and, hence, can be equivariantly prolonged to P, thus becoming
an element of Gω.
■
Remark 6.1.6 As an immediate consequence of the fact that Gω is an (embedded)
Lie subgroup, the projection G →G /Gω deﬁnes a locally trivial principal Gω-bundle
[92, Sect. 6.2.4].
♦
Finally, we introduce the gauge orbit space M . It is obtained from C by factorizing
with respect to the group action (6.1.2):

468

The Yang-Mills Equation
M := C /G .
At this stage, this is just a topological quotient. It will be equipped with additional
structure later. Note that M is the space of classes of gauge equivalent potentials,
the 'true' conﬁguration space. In [476] it was shown that the mapping
C × G →C × C ,
(ω, u) 
→(ω, ω(u)) ,
is closed. Together with the compactness of the stabilizers, this implies the following,
see Corollary I/6.3.3/3 or [93, III, Sect. 4].
Theorem 6.1.7 The action of G on C is proper.
This, in turn, has the following immediate consequences5:
(a) The orbits of the action of G on C are closed.
(b) The orbit space M is Hausdorff.
In the sequel, an orthogonal splitting of the tangent bundle into the vertical distrib-
ution V spanned by the tangent spaces to the orbits and a horizontal complement H
will be of fundamental importance:
TC = V ⊕H .
(6.1.18)
This decomposition formula will be proved below. First, to calculate V, consider a
smooth element ξ ∈LG , the corresponding curve t 
→expG (tξ) and the curve
t 
→γ (t) := expG (−tξ) ω expG (tξ) + expG (−tξ) d expG (−tξ),
(6.1.19)
on the gauge orbit through ω ∈C . The tangent vector to this curve at ω is
dξ + [ω, ξ] = ∇ωξ ∈Ω1(M, Ad(P)) .
Thus, the tangent space to the orbit at ω coincides with the image ∇ω(Ω0(Ad(P))).
Clearly, this characterization carries over to the Sobolev completion
∇ω : W k+1(Ad(P)) →W k(T∗M ⊗Ad(P)) .
This provides the following presentation of inﬁnitesimal gauge transformations.
Remark 6.1.8 (Inﬁnitesimal gauge transformations) Let ξ ∈LG , take t 
→ρ(t) =
exp(tξ), insert it into (6.1.8) and differentiate with respect to t at t = 0. This yields
ω(ξ) = ω + ∇ωξ .
(6.1.20)
5This is proved by the same arguments as in the proof of Proposition I/6.3.4.

Let η be the Maurer-Cartan form on G . As in the ﬁnite-dimensional case, this is
the left-invariant 1-form on G generated by the identity endomorphism of the Lie
algebra, that is,
η1 = idLG .
Then,foraleftinvariantvectorﬁeldξ∗onG generatedbyξ ∈LG ,wehaveη(ξ∗) = ξ.
We denote the differential on C by δ and its restriction to the orbits of G by ˆδ. Then,
ˆδω(ξ∗) = ω(ξ) −ω and we obtain
ˆδω(ξ∗) = ∇ωξ = ∇ωη(ξ∗) ,
and, thus,
ˆδω = ∇ω ◦η .
♦
To ﬁnd Hω, consider the Laplace operator Δω given by (6.1.14) acting on zero-forms,
Δω = ∇ω∗◦∇ω :
W k+1(Ad(P)) →W k−1(Ad(P)) .
Recall that it is elliptic and that, by elliptic regularity,
ker(Δω) ⊂Γ ∞(Ad(P)) .
Moreover, applying the Hodge Theorem 5.7.18 to the case of 0-forms, we obtain
W k−1(Ad(P)) = ker(Δω) ⊕im(Δω) .
(6.1.21)
By Remark 5.7.19, the orthogonal projectors onto im(Δω) and ker(Δω) are given by
ΔωGω ,
1 −ΔωGω ,
(6.1.22)
respectively. Here, Gω is the Green's operator (5.7.34) of Δω. In addition, since
im(∇ω) ⊥ker(∇ω∗),
ker(Δω) = ker(∇ω) .
(6.1.23)
Moreover, since im(Δω) ⊂im(∇ω∗) and im(∇ω∗) ⊥ker(∇ω), the decomposition
(6.1.21) implies
im(Δω) = im(∇ω∗) .
(6.1.24)
Finally, (6.1.23) and (6.1.24) imply
∇ωGωΔω = ∇ω ,
ΔωGω∇ω∗= ∇ω∗.

Theorem 6.1.9 For every ω ∈C , one has the L2-orthogonal decomposition

The Yang-Mills Equation
W k(T∗M ⊗Ad(P)) = im(∇ω) ⊕ker(∇ω∗) .
The orthogonal projectors onto im(∇ω) and ker(∇ω∗) are given by
vω = ∇ωGω∇ω∗,
hω = id −vω ,
(6.1.26)
respectively.
Proof We show that the bounded linear operator
∇ωGω∇ω∗: W k(T∗M ⊗Ad(P)) →W k(T∗M ⊗Ad(P))
is the L2-orthogonal projector onto the subspace im(∇ω) and
ker(∇ωGω∇ω∗) = ker(∇ω∗) .
Using (6.1.25), we obtain

∇ωGω∇ω∗2 = ∇ωGωΔωGω∇ω∗= ∇ωGω∇ω∗,
that is, ∇ωGω∇ω∗is a projector. As a consequence,
im(∇ωGω∇ω∗) = ker(1 −∇ωGω∇ω∗) ,
hence im(∇ωGω∇ω∗) is closed, and one has
W k(T∗M ⊗Ad(P)) = im(∇ωGω∇ω∗) ⊕ker(∇ωGω∇ω∗) .
(6.1.27)
Since Gω = 0 on ker(Δω), the Hodge decomposition and (6.1.24) imply
im(Gω) = im(GωΔω) = im(Gω∇ω∗) .
Since, in addition, im(Gω) = ker(∇ω)⊥, we conclude
im(∇ωGω∇ω∗) = im(∇ωGω) = im(∇ω) .
Since Gω is injective on im(∇ω∗) = im(Δω),
ker(∇ωGω∇ω∗) = ker(∇ω∗) .
Since im(∇ω) and ker(∇ω∗) are L2-orthogonal, the assertion follows.
■
Remark 6.1.10 From Theorem 6.1.9, we conclude
Vω = im(∇ω) ,
Hω = ker(∇ω∗) .
(6.1.28)

Thus, by (6.1.15), the distributions V and H are equivariant,
Vω(u) = (Vω)(u) ,
Hω(u) = (Hω)(u) .
Correspondingly, for any u ∈G ,
Gω(u) = Ad(u−1) ◦Gω ◦Ad(u) ,
(6.1.29)

6.2
The Yang-Mills Equation. Self-dual Connections
Now, we come to the dynamics of the Yang-Mills system. Typically, the dynamical
equations for a model of classical ﬁeld theory are obtained as the Euler-Lagrange
equations of a variational principle for the physical action built from the ﬁelds. In
a gauge theory, the action functional should be gauge invariant. At this point, the
reader may wish to consult Chap.4 of Volume I. In Sect.I/4.6 we have discussed
the Maxwell equations in some detail. There, we have used the L2-scalar product
on the space of (square-integrable) 2-forms on Minkowski space M to construct an
invariant 4-form (the Lagrangian) from the electromagnetic 2-form f ,
L(A) = −1
2f ∧∗f
and to build the physical action S(A) =

M L(A). Here, A is a gauge potential for f ,
that is, f = dA.6 The variational principle for this action yields the second group7 of
the (source-free) Maxwell equations in the vacuum,
d∗f = 0 .
We extend this to the Yang-Mills case. Using the L2-scalar product on Ω2(M, Ad(P))
given by (6.1.4), we deﬁne the following gauge invariant functional on the conﬁgu-
ration space8:
S : C →R ,
S(ω) = 1

(6.2.1)
6We have used the notation of Volume I here.
7The ﬁrst group of Maxwell equations is of purely geometric character. It says that the 2-form f is
closed. In terms of connection theory, this equation clearly coincides with the Bianchi identity.
8The factor 1
2 is chosen according to the conventions used in physics.

The Yang-Mills Equation
This quantity will be referred to as the Yang-Mills action. Accordingly, the n-form
L(ω) = 1
2Ω
.∧∗Ω will be called the Lagrange density or, simply, the Lagrangian of
the Yang-Mills theory.
Remark 6.2.1 Depending on the context, alternatively, we will write
S(ω) = 1
2⟨Ω, Ω⟩L2 = 1
2∥Ω∥2 = 1


M
|Ω|2vg ,
(6.2.2)
where |Ω|2 is deﬁned by
Ω
.∧∗Ω = |Ω|2vg .
By formula (4.5.12) of Volume I, the sign of |Ω|2 depends on the signature of g. If
g is Riemannian it is positive, on Minkowski space it is negative.
♦
Next, we derive the ﬁeld equations of a pure Yang-Mills theory. First, recall that
any connection fulﬁls the Bianchi identity DωΩ = 0, cf. Proposition 1.4.11. In the
sequel, if not otherwise stated, we will view the curvature form Ω as an element of
Ω2(M, AdP). Then, the Bianchi identity takes the form
dωΩ = 0 .
(6.2.3)
This identity yields the ﬁrst group of ﬁeld equations of a Yang-Mills theory. For the
Abelian case, G = U(1), it coincides with the ﬁrst group of Maxwell's equations.
We derive the second group of ﬁeld equations by postulating a variational principle
for the Yang-Mills action (6.2.1),
δS(ω) = 0 .
(6.2.4)
Let us derive the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to this variational princi-
ple. Since the conﬁguration space C is an afﬁne space with translation vector space
T , we have
TωC = T
and the derivative of S at ω in the direction of α ∈TωC is given by
δSω(α) = d
dt ↾0
S(ω + tα) .
By the Structure Equation, the curvature of the connection form ω + tα is given by
Ωt = Ω + tdωα + t2
2 [α, α] .

Using this and (2.7.51), we calculate

(6.2.6)
This is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the above variational principle. It will be
referred to as the (pure) Yang-Mills equation. Keeping in mind the analogy with
Maxwell electrodynamics mentioned above, one may call (6.2.3) the ﬁrst group and
(6.2.6) the second group of Yang-Mills equations.
Deﬁnition 6.2.2 A solution to the Yang-Mills equation will be called a Yang-Mills
connection.
Remark 6.2.3
1. In terms of local representatives Aμ and Fμν, Eq. (6.2.6) takes the form (Exercise
6.2.1)
∂μF μν + [Aμ, F μν] = 0 .
(6.2.7)
2. For the Abelian group G = U(1), we have g = iR. In this case, all commutators
vanish and we obtain dω = d. Thus, (6.2.3) and (6.2.6) take the form
dΩ = 0 ,
d∗Ω = 0 .
Writing f for the local representative of Ω, we obtain the (sourcefree) Maxwell
equations
df = 0 ,
d∗f = 0
as a special case of the Yang-Mills equation.
3. One easily shows (Exercise 6.2.2) that a connection ω fulﬁls the Yang-Mills
equation iff □ωΩ = 0.
For the remainder of this section, we assume that M is a 4-dimensional oriented
Riemannian manifold and that G is a compact connected Lie group. These assump-
tions have the following immediate consequences:
(a) Since G is compact, we may choose the Ad(G)-invariant inner product ⟨·, ·⟩g to
be positive deﬁnite. Then, (6.1.4) deﬁnes a norm ∥· ∥on Ω2(M, Ad(P)).
(b) Since M is 4-dimensional, by (2.8.17), we have the decomposition
2T∗M = 2
+T∗M ⊕2
−T∗M ,
(6.2.8)

The Yang-Mills Equation
into the ﬁbrewise eigenspaces of the Hodge star operator and a corresponding
decomposition of the space of 2-forms Ω2(M).
Clearly, the decomposition (6.2.8) extends to Ω2(M, E) for any associated bundle
E and persists for any Sobolev completion (under the assumptions made on G and
M). Now, recall the notion of (anti-)self-duality from Sect.2.8.
Deﬁnition 6.2.4 A connection form ω on a principal bundle P(M, G) is called self-
dual or anti-self-dual, if its curvature form Ω ∈Ω2(M, Ad(P)) is self-dual or anti-
self-dual, respectively.
Proposition 6.2.5 Every self-dual or anti-self-dual connection is a Yang-Mills con-
nection.
Proof This is an immediate consequence of the Bianchi identity.
■
We show that the property of (anti-)self-duality is a conformal invariant.
Lemma 6.2.6 The Hodge star operator on a Riemannian manifold (M, g) restricted
to 2-forms is conformally invariant iff dim M = 4.
Proof Let dim M = k and let ϕ : M →M be a conformal transformation, that is,
there exists a nowhere vanishing f ∈C∞(M) such that ϕ∗g = f 2g. Then, det(ϕ∗g) =
f 2k det(g) and, thus, the volume forms are related by
vϕ∗g = f k vg .
On the other hand, for α ∈Ω2(M), we have
(ϕ∗g)−1(α) = 1
f 4 g−1(α) .
This implies
(ϕ∗g)−1(α) ⌟vϕ∗g = f k−4g−1(α) ⌟vg ,
that is, the star operators deﬁned by g and by ϕ∗g coincide iff k = 4.
■
Note that this proof may be extended to conformal mappings between Riemannian
manifolds (of dimension 4).
Proposition 6.2.7 Let (N, h) and (M, g) be oriented 4-dimensional Riemannian
manifoldsandletϕ : N →M beaconformalorientationpreservingdiffeomorphism.
Let (P, M, G, π) be a principal ﬁbre bundle. If ω is a self-dual (or anti-self-dual)
connection on P, then the pullback of ω under ϕ is a self-dual (or anti-self-dual)
connection on the pullback bundle ϕ∗P.

6.2 The Yang-Mills Equation. Self-dual Connections
475
Proof For clearness of presentation, in this proof, we denote the curvature form
of ω, viewed as an element of Ω2
Ad,hor(P, g) by ˜Ω and, viewed as an element of
Ω2(M, Ad(P)), by Ω. Let us denote the Hodge star operators corresponding to h
and g by ∗h and ∗g, respectively, and let ϑ : ϕ∗P →P be the natural principal
bundle morphism projecting onto ϕ. By assumption, ∗gΩ = ±Ω. We have to show
that ϑ∗˜Ω is (anti-)self-dual with respect to the metric h. For that purpose, for y ∈N,
(y, p) ∈ϕ∗P ⊂N × P, Y1, Y2 ∈TyN and Z1, Z2 ∈TpP such that π′(Zi) = ϕ′(Yi),
we calculate
(ϑ∗˜Ω)y(Y1, Y2) = ι(y,p) ◦(ϑ∗˜Ω)(y,p)((Y1, Z1), (Y2, Z2))
= ι(y,p) ◦˜Ωp(ϑ′(Y1, Z1), ϑ′(Y2, Z2))
= ι(y,p) ◦ι−1

that is,
(ϑ∗˜Ω)y = ι(y,p) ◦ι−1

(6.2.9)
Here, ι−1
p
: Ad(P) →g and ι(y,p) : g →Ad(ϕ∗P) and the composition ι(y,p) ◦ι−1
p
is the ﬁbre mapping of the bundle isomorphism ϕ∗(Ad(P)) ∼= Ad(ϕ∗P). Thus, for
calculating the Hodge star of (ϑ∗˜Ω) with respect to the metric h, it is enough to
apply it to ϕ∗Ω. Using that ϕ is a conformal orientation preserving diffeomorphism,
we obtain
ϕ∗(∗gΩ) = ϕ∗(g−1(Ω)⌟vg)

But ϕ∗◦g◦ϕ∗: X(N) →Ω1(N) is the isomorphism deﬁned by the pullback metric
ϕ∗g. Using this and Lemma 6.2.6, we obtain
±ϕ∗Ω = ϕ∗(∗gΩ) = (ϕ∗g)−1(ϕ∗Ω)⌟vϕ∗g = ∗hϕ∗Ω .
■
Remark 6.2.8 From Proposition 6.2.7 we conclude that, in particular, (anti-)self-
duality of a connection is a property which is invariant under gauge transformations.
Next, we will prove that (anti-)self-dual connections correspond to absolute min-
ima of the Yang-Mills action. For that purpose, let us assume that G is compact and
simple and, for the Ad-invariant scalar product on g, let us choose the negative of
the Killing form,

Recall from Chap.4 the ﬁrst Pontryagin class p1(Ad(P)) ∈H4
dR(M) and the corre-
sponding ﬁrst Pontryagin index. By Corollary 4.6.17,
p1(Ad(P)) =


Proposition 6.2.9 Let G be a compact Lie group and let P be a principal G-bundle
over a 4-dimensional oriented compact Riemannian manifold. Then, the following
lower bound for the Yang-Mills action holds:
S(ω) ≥4π2|p1(Ad(P))| .
Proof According to Example 4.6.22,
p1(Ad(P)) = −1
8π2 tr(adΩ ∧adΩ) .
Decomposing the curvature form according to (2.8.8) as Ω = Ω+ + Ω−, using
(2.7.3) and the (anti-)self-duality of Ω±, and integrating over M, we obtain
8π2p1(Ad(P)) = ⟨Ω, ∗Ω⟩L2
= ⟨Ω+ + Ω−, Ω+ −Ω−⟩L2
=∥Ω+ ∥2 −∥Ω−∥2 .
(6.2.10)
On the other hand, we have
S(ω) = 1
2 ∥Ω ∥2= 1
2⟨Ω+ + Ω−, Ω+ + Ω−⟩L2 = 1
2(∥Ω+ ∥2 + ∥Ω−∥2) .
(6.2.11)
Taking the sum and the difference of Eqs. (6.2.10) and (6.2.11), we obtain
−4π2p1(Ad(P))+ ∥Ω+ ∥2= S(ω) = 4π2p1(Ad(P))+ ∥Ω−∥2 .
(6.2.12)
This yields the assertion.
■
Formula (6.2.12) implies the following corollary, which shows that (anti-)self-dual
connections correspond to absolute minima of the Yang-Mills action.

6.2 The Yang-Mills Equation. Self-dual Connections
477
Corollary 6.2.10 For p1(Ad(P)) > 0, we have S(ω) ≥4π2p1(Ad(P)) and equal-
ity if Ω−= 0, that is, if ω is self-dual. For p1(Ad(P)) < 0, we have S(ω) ≥
−4π2p1(Ad(P)) and equality if Ω+ = 0, that is, if ω is anti-self-dual.
■
From (6.2.10) we note that, for a self-dual connection, p1(Ad(P)) > 0. Corre-
spondingly, for an anti-self-dual connection, we have p1(Ad(P)) < 0.
In the sequel, an (anti-)self-dual connection on a 4-dimensional Riemannian man-
ifold will be called an (anti-)instanton. In the next sections, we will systematically
discuss the theory of this important class of solutions.

The BPST Instanton Family
Here, we discuss the so-called BPST-(anti-)instantons, that is, the (anti-)self-dual
solutions to the Yang-Mills equation on S4 with instanton number ±1 for the gauge
group Sp(1). Here, BPST stands for Belavin, Polyakov, Schwartz and Tyupkin, see
[64]. We describe these solutions in the bundle language, characterize them topologi-
cally and discuss their local description. Finally, we construct further (anti-)self-dual
solutions by using the conformal symmetry of S4. We use the notation of Examples
1.1.22, 1.1.24 and 1.3.22.
We will use the diffeomorphism S4 ∼= HP1 given by (B.1). To be consistent
with standard formulae in gauge theory, we choose the orientation of HP1 so that
this diffeomorphism is compatible with the standard orientation of S4, cf. Remark
4.5.4. Recall that the stereographic projection mappings (Us, ϕs) and (Un, ϕn) con-
stitute an oriented atlas of S4. Choosing one of them, say ϕs, and extending it to a
diffeomorphism
ϕs : S4 ∼= HP1 →H ∪{∞}
(6.3.1)
by sending the southpole −e0 to {∞}, one obtains a conformal identiﬁcation.
Now, consider the block-diagonal embedding of the closed subgroup9 Sp(1) ×
Sp(1) ⊂Sp(2) and its action by right translations on Sp(2). Here, the ﬁrst and
the second component of Sp(1) × Sp(1) are identiﬁed with the upper and lower
diagonal block, respectively. By Example 1.1.4/4, this action deﬁnes a principal
(Sp(1) × Sp(1))-bundle P over
Sp(2)/(Sp(1) × Sp(1)) ∼= GH(1, 2) ∼= HP1 .
9Since we use the language of quaternions, we consistently write Sp(1). Recall that Sp(1) ∼= SU(2)
as real Lie groups.

The Yang-Mills Equation
By Examples 5.2.11 and 5.4.9, Sp(1) × Sp(1) is the spin group in four dimensions
and P coincides with the spin structure S(S4). Using the left actions
σ∓: (Sp(1) × Sp(1)) × Sp(1) →Sp(1) ,
σ∓(h)(g) := λ∓(h)g ,
deﬁned in Example 5.5.7, we build the following associated bundles:
P−:= P ×Sp(1)×Sp(1),σ−Sp(1) ,
P+ := P ×Sp(1)×Sp(1),σ+ Sp(1) .
(6.3.2)
Clearly, both of these bundles are principal Sp(1)-bundles over HP1 with the right
Sp(1)-action given by right translation on the typical ﬁbre Sp(1). The canonical
projections in P and P∓are denoted by π and π∓, respectively.
For our purposes, we need an explicit matrix description of these bundles. This is
provided by the following remark.
Remark 6.3.1
1. We use the following parameterization of the Lie groups involved:
Sp(2) =
	
q1 p1
q2 p2

: ∥q1∥2 + ∥q2∥2 = 1 , ∥p1∥2 + ∥p2∥2 = 1 , q1 p1 + q2 p2 = 0

,
where q1, p1, q2, p2 ∈H. Then,
Sp(1) × Sp(1) =
	
u1 0
0 u2

: ∥u1∥= 1 = ∥u2∥, u1, u2 ∈H

.
In this parameterization, the diffeomorphism (5.4.8) is given by
Sp(2)/(Sp(1) × Sp(1)) →HP1 ,


q1 p1
q2 p2


→


q1

.
Now, using this formula, together with (B.2), and denoting ϕs(z) = x, we may
write down useful (equivalent) representations of points on S4 \ {−e0}:
x 
→(1 + ∥x∥2)−1

2. In the above parameterization, points of P∓are represented as
[(k, u)] ,
k =

q1 p1
q2 p2

∈Sp(2) , u ∈Sp(1) ,
with the deﬁning equivalence relation given by
(k, u) ∼(kh, σ∓(h−1)u) ,
h =

u1 0
0 u2

∈Sp(1) × Sp(1) .

6.3 The BPST Instanton Family

Since the actions σ∓are transitive, we may choose the following parameteriza-
tions of [(k, u)]:

Thus, we may identify
P−→Sp(2)/λ+(Sp(1) × Sp(1)) ,
[(k, u)]

q1u p1

,
P+ →Sp(2)/λ−(Sp(1) × Sp(1)) ,
[(k, u)] 
→


q1 p1u
q2 p2u

.
Clearly, these mappings deﬁne principal Sp(1)-bundle isomorphisms.
By Remark 1.1.25, P−coincides with the Stiefel bundle SH(1, 2) →GH(1, 2)
and,thus,withthequaternionicHopfbundlePH.Tomakecontactwiththeoriginal
deﬁnition of PH, given in Example 1.1.22, one easily shows (Exercise 6.3.2) that,
in the above parameterization, elements of SH(1, 2) ∼= Sp(2)/Sp(1) may be
represented as follows:

q1 −q1q2
∥q1∥
q2 ∥q1∥

,
∥q1∥2 + ∥q2∥2 = 1 ,
(6.3.4)
that is, by elements (q1, q2) ∈S7 ⊂H2. This describes the isomorphism (1.1.12)
for K = H and n = 2 explicitly.
3. In the parameterization given in point 1, we have a natural system {(Us,n, χs,n)}
of local trivializations of P. In the standard notation χs,n = π × κs,n, it is given
by

The Yang-Mills Equation
Next recall that, by Example 1.3.19, P carries a canonical connection ω0 given by
(1.3.17). Since for k ∈Sp(2) we have k−1 = k, in the above parameterization,
formula (1.3.17) reads10
ω0 =

q1 dq1 + q2 dq2
0
0
p1 dp1 + p2 dp2

.
(6.3.7)
By deﬁnition, ω0 is invariant under left Sp(2)-translations. Clearly, ω0 induces Sp(2)-
invariant connection forms on the principal bundles P∓:
ω−= q1 dq1 + q2 dq2 ,
ω+ = p1 dp1 + p2 dp2 .
(6.3.8)
Under the identiﬁcation P−∼= PH, ω−coincides with the canonical connection of
the quaternionic Hopf bundle, cf. formula (1.3.21). The above splitting of ω0 has a
deep geometric meaning which will be explained in Remark 6.5.10.
Proposition 6.3.2 The connection forms ω+ and ω−are self-dual and anti-self-dual,
respectively.
Proof Since ω0 is Sp(2)-invariant and since Sp(2) acts transitively on the bundle
space, it is enough to prove (anti-)self-duality at one point of P−and P+, respectively.
We choose the point corresponding to the unit element 1 ∈Sp(2). By the deﬁning
relations of Sp(2), at this point we have dq1 = −dq1 and dp2 = −dp2. Thus, by the
Structure Equation, the curvature form of ω0 at 1 reads
Ω0
1 =

dq2 ∧dq2
0
0
dp1 ∧dp1

.
(6.3.9)
To ﬁnd the local representative of Ω0
1 at π(1), we use the chart (Us, ϕs). Then, by
(B.2) and by the Local Reconstruction Formula (1.4.18),
Ω0
1 = (π∗F 0
s )1 =

(ϕs ◦π)∗◦(ϕ−1
s )∗F 0
s

1 ≡

(ϕs ◦π)∗F0
s

1 ,
where F 0
s is the local representative of Ω0 on Us and F0
s is its pullback under the
chart mapping ϕs to ϕs(Us) = R4. By (6.3.3), we obtain
F0
s(0) =

dx ∧dx
0
0
dx ∧dx

.
We claim that the sp(1)-valued 2-forms F+
s (0) = dx ∧dx and F−
s (0) = dx ∧dx are
self-dual and anti-self-dual, respectively, with respect to the Euclidean metric on R4.
In standard coordinates {xi} on R4, the action of the Hodge star operator on 2-forms
is given by
10Since this expression is given in terms of the associative multiplication in H, in the sequel it will
be worthwhile to work with the associative exterior calculus, cf. Remark 1.4.8 /1.

6.3 The BPST Instanton Family

∗R4 (dxi ∧dxj) = 1

kl dxk ∧dxl .
(6.3.10)
We calculate
dx ∧dx = (dx11 −dx2i −dx3j −dx4k) ∧(dx11 + dx2i + dx3j + dx4k)
= 2(dx1 ∧dx2 −dx3 ∧dx4)i + 2(dx1 ∧dx3 −dx4 ∧dx2)j
+ 2(dx1 ∧dx4 −dx2 ∧dx3)k .
On the other hand, from (6.3.10), we read off
∗R4(dx1 ∧dx2 −dx3 ∧dx4) = −(dx1 ∧dx2 −dx3 ∧dx4)
and analogous formulae for the second and the third term. Thus,
∗R4(dx ∧dx) = −dx ∧dx,
that is, ∗R4F−
s (0) = −F−
s (0). By Lemma B.1, ϕs is an orientation preserving con-
formal diffeomorphism from Us ⊂S4 to R4 and, thus, using Proposition 6.2.7 we
obtain:
F −
s = ϕ∗
s F−
s = −ϕ∗
s

∗R4F−
s

= −∗S4 F −
s .
In the same way, one shows that F +
s is self-dual.
■
Thus, the canonical connection on P yields both a self-dual and an anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills connection. To make contact with the physics literature, let us describe
these solutions in terms of their local representatives. We present the calculation
for ω−using the conformal identiﬁcation (B.4). For clearness of presentation, in
our notation we skip the stereographic projection mapping, thus, identifying the
local representatives A −
s,n of ω−for the system of local trivializations {(Us,n, χ−
s,n}
with their counterparts A−
s,n := (ϕ−1
s )∗A −
s,n on H ∼= R4. By (6.3.5), the mapping
κ−
s : π−1(Us) →Sp(1), associated with χ−
s , is given by
κ−
s (q1, q2) =
q1
∥q1∥.
Then, the local section σs, deﬁned by κ−
s via κ−
s (σs(x)) = 1, reads as follows:

(6.3.11)
Next, let us calculate the local representative F−
s of the curvature. By Remark 1.4.8/1,
we have
F−
s = dA−
s + A−
s ∧A−
s .
Since d¯x x + ¯x dx = d∥x∥2, we may write
A−
s (x) =
x dx
1 + ∥x∥2 −1
2
d∥x∥2
1 + ∥x∥2 .
Using this, one easily calculates
dA−
s (x) =
dx ∧dx
(1 + ∥x∥2)2 −xdx ∧x dx
(1 + ∥x∥2)2
and
(A−
s ∧A−
s )(x) = x dx ∧x dx
(1 + ∥x∥2)2 .
Thus,
F−
s (x) =
dx ∧dx
(1 + ∥x∥2)2 .
(6.3.12)
Note that F−
s (0) = dx ∧dx, indeed. A completely analogous calculation yields the
local representative
A+
s (x) = (ϕ−1
s )∗A +
s (x) = Im
	
x dx

(6.3.13)
of ω+. Thus,
F+
s (x) =
dx ∧dx
(1 + ∥x∥2)2 .
(6.3.14)
Remark 6.3.3
1. By Proposition 6.2.7, the sp(1)-valued 1-forms A+
s and A−
s may be viewed as
the global representatives of a self-dual and an anti-self-dual connection form on
the trivial principal Sp(1)-bundles (ϕ−1
s )∗P+ and (ϕ−1
s )∗P−over R4, respectively.
The solutions (6.3.11) and (6.3.13) have ﬁrst been found by Belavin, Polyakov,
Schwartz and Tyupkin, see [64]. Therefore, they are called the BPST instanton
and the BPST anti-instanton on R4, respectively. Correspondingly, the connection
forms ω+ and ω−are called the BPST instanton and BPST anti-instanton on S4,

6.3 The BPST Instanton Family
483
respectively. In the mathematics literature, they are often referred to as the basic
(anti-)instantons.
2. There is a fundamental theorem of K. Uhlenbeck [636] which states the following:
let ω be a self-dual connection on a bundle P over M \ {m1, . . . , mk} such that
its Yang-Mills action (6.2.1) is ﬁnite. Then, (P, ω) extends smoothly to M, that
is, both the bundle and the connection extend smoothly across each of the points
mi. This result is usually referred to as the Removable Singularity Theorem.
As an application, there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between self-
dual connections over R4 having a ﬁnite action and self-dual connections on
bundles over S4. In the Euclidean context under consideration, it is reasonable to
refer to the ﬁnite-action property as to ﬁnite energy. In the sequel, we adopt this
terminology.
♦
Next, let us characterize the BPST (anti-)instanton on S4 topologically. By Theorem
4.8.8, principal Sp(1)-bundles over S4 are classiﬁed by their second Chern class.
Thus, topologically, the BPST (anti-)instantons are completely characterized by the
second Chern indices of the bundles P−and P+. By Remark 4.5.4, we have
c2(P−) =

S4 c2(P−) = 1 ,
c2(P+) =

S4 c2(P+)) = −1 .
The following yields interesting additional insight: as a consequence of Theorem
1.1.11, principal bundles over Sn with connected structure group G are classiﬁed by
elements of πn−1(G). After bringing the bundle to a normal form, this equivalence is
provided by the restriction of one of the transition mappings, say ρs,n : Us∩Un →G,
to the equator Sn−1 of Sn. Thus, principal bundles with structure group G = Sp(1) ∼=
S3 over S4 are classiﬁed by elements of π3(Sp(1)), that is, by homotopy classes of
mappings S3 →S3. These, in turn, are labeled by their mapping degree. By (6.3.6)
and (B.1), for the bundles P−and P+ we obtain
(ρ−
s,n)↾S3(x) = x ,
(ρ+
s,n)↾S3(x) = x .
(6.3.15)
The ﬁrst mapping has degree −1 and the second one has degree +1 (Exercise 6.3.3).11
Thus, up to the sign, the ﬁrst Chern index and the mapping degree distinguishing an
element of π3(Sp(1)) coincide.
Again, let us make contact with the description in terms of local representatives.
We show how the above mapping degree characterizes the corresponding self-dual
connections on R4 with ﬁnite energy. Let A be such a connection. Then, ﬁrst, the
ﬁnite energy requirement ensures that the curvature form F of A is square integrable.
This implies that F must be asymptotically ﬂat, that is, F →0 for ∥x∥→∞. This, in
turn, means that A must be asymptotically a pure gauge, A 
→g−1dg for ∥x∥→∞.
Clearly, the mapping g is, in general, only deﬁned outside of a ball with radius R > 0
centered at 0. In general, it cannot be extended continuously to all of R4, because its
restriction to S3
R := {x ∈R4 : ∥x∥= R},
11Choosing, instead, the transition mapping ρn,s results in a change of sign of these mapping degrees.

Proposition 6.3.4 Let ω be a self-dual connection on a principal Sp(1)-bundle P
over S4 and let A be its representative on R4 given by one of the stereographic
projection mappings. Then, the degree of the mapping (6.3.16) characterizing A
coincides, up to the sign, with the second Chern index of P.
Proof Let Ω be the curvature form of ω and let F be its local representative with
respect to the chosen stereographic projection mapping, say (Us, ϕs).12 We wish to
express the second Chern index

in terms of the mapping degree characterizing A. Clearly, A may be modiﬁed without
changing the degree of the mapping (6.3.16) in such a way that F vanishes not only
at inﬁnity, but outside of a closed ball KR of radius R and on its boundary ∂KR ∼= S3,
for sufﬁciently large R, see Fig.6.1. As usual, the boundary ∂KR is endowed with the
orientation corresponding to the coorientation pointing outwards. Then,

As a 4-form on a contractible subset of R4, tr(F ∧F) is closed and thus, by the
Poincaré Lemma, exact. The following Lemma yields a potential.

Proof In the associative calculus, the Structure Equation yields
F ∧F = dA ∧dA + dA ∧A ∧A + A ∧A ∧dA + A ∧A ∧A ∧A .
Using the cyclicity of the trace, we obtain
tr(A ∧A ∧A ∧A) = 0 ,
tr(A ∧A ∧dA) = tr(dA ∧A ∧A) .
Thus,
tr(F ∧F) = tr(dA ∧dA) + 2 tr(dA ∧A ∧A) .
Since
tr(dA ∧dA) = d(tr(A ∧dA)) ,
and, again by the cyclicity of the trace,
d(tr(A ∧A ∧A)) = 3 tr(dA ∧A ∧A) ,
we obtain
tr(F ∧F) = d(tr(A ∧dA)) + 2
3 d(tr(A ∧A ∧A)) = dQ3 .
This proves the lemma.

Remark 6.3.6
1. In the sequel, the mapping degree deg(h) or, equivalently, minus the second Chern
index of P will be called the instanton number. It will be denoted by k(P).
2. For the BPST (anti-)instanton on S4, the statement of Proposition 6.3.4 can be
seen by direct inspection. Consider ω−. As above, let us represent inﬁnity by the
south pole −e0 and let us study the asymptotic behaviour of A−

♦
In the remainder of this section we show how to construct further instanton solutions
by using the conformal invariance of the equation ∗F = ±F. By Appendix B, under
the conformal identiﬁcation, S4 = HP1 ∼= H ∪{∞} the proper (that is, orientation
preserving) conformal group of S4 is given by
C0(S4, [g0]) = SL(2, H)/{±1} .
(6.3.20)
Clearly, its universal covering group is C0(S4, [g0]) = SL(2, H) . For concreteness,
consider the canonical (anti-self-dual) solution ω−on P−. View P−as the quater-
nionic Hopf bundle, cf. Remark 6.3.1/2.

6.3 The BPST Instanton Family

Proposition 6.3.7 The action of the conformal group of S4 lifts naturally to an action
of SL(2, H) on P−by automorphisms.

deﬁnes a left smooth action on the bundle space S7 ⊂H2. This mapping obviously
commutes with the right principal action of Sp(1) and it projects onto the conformal
action on S4, cf. Appendix B.
■
Clearly, the conformal group lifts to P+ in the same way. Combining this proposition
with Proposition 6.2.7, we conclude that ˜Ψ ∗
k ω−is again an anti-self-dual connection
form on P−, for any k ∈SL(2, H). On the other hand, by construction, ω−is Sp(2)-
invariant and Sp(2) ⊂SL(2, H) is the full symmetry group of ω−. Thus, the orbit of
ω−under the action of the conformal group is SL(2, H)/Sp(2). It turns out that, for
G = Sp(1), all anti-instantons on S4 with instanton number k(P) = −1 are obtained
in this way. This will be shown in Sect.6.5.
To describe the family of anti-self-dual solutions obtained by conformal transfor-
mations explicitly, we need an explicit parameterization of the above homogeneous
space. Since Sp(2) is the maximal compact subgroup of the semisimple Lie group
SL(2, H), this is easily achieved by using the Iwasawa decomposition of SL(2, H).
For convenience, we write it in the inverse order SL(2, H) = NAK, where

(6.3.24)
Note that the curvature is centered at x0 and it is spread over a region of magnitude
λ. Therefore, λ is called the scale and x0 is called the centre of the instanton.
In the same way, from (6.3.13), we may create a 5-parameter family of instantons
with k(P) = 1.
Remark 6.3.8 Over the years, the relevance of instantons in quantum ﬁeld theory has
been investigated. We refer to [569] for an introduction to this problem on a sound
mathematical basis. The basic observation is that instantons interpolate between
topologically inequivalent vacua of the quantum theory. This is often referred to as
the tunneling effect. Here, we only explain the classical counterpart of this effect.
Starting from a classical gauge potential A on Minkowski space, we choose a gauge
such that A0 = 0 and consider only static conﬁgurations, that is, conﬁgurations
fulﬁlling Ak = Ak(x), x ∈R3. A classical vacuum is characterized by F(x) = 0.
Thus, the corresponding potential must be a pure gauge,
Ak(x) = h−1(x) ∂kh(x) ,
for all x ∈R3. We assume that the limit
lim
x→∞h(x) = h0
exists. Then, h may be extended to S3 = R3 ∪{∞} and we obtain a classiﬁcation
of classical vacua in terms of the degree of the mapping h: S3 →Sp(1) ∼= S3.
Now, let (x, t) 
→g(x, t) be the mapping obtained from the instanton asymptotics
Aμ(x, t) ∼g−1(x, t) ∂μg(x, t). By choosing an appropriate gauge, one can fulﬁl the
following conditions
1. g(x, t) →1 for x ∈R3 and t →−∞,
2. g(x, t) →1 for t ∈R and x →∞,
3. g(x, t) →h(x) for t →∞.
We see that g interpolates between h ≡1 und h = h(x), that is, g interpolates
between the classical vacua Ak(x) = 0 and Ak(x) = h−1(x) ∂kh(x).

The ADHM Construction
In this section, we construct all (anti-)self-dual Sp(1)-connections on S4 with arbi-
trary instanton number k(P). This construction goes back to Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin
and Manin [35] and is, therefore, called the ADHM construction. In our presentation
we follow the strategy outlined at the end of Sect.II/3 of [30]. For that purpose, we
recall from Theorem 3.4.10 that the quaternionic Stiefel bundle14
πc : SH(1, k + 1) ∼= S4k+3 →GH(1, k + 1) ∼= HPk
is k-classifying for the principal Sp(1)-bundles P →S4 ∼= HP1. Now, the ADHM
construction may be summarized as follows: take the canonical Sp(1)-connection15
ωc = q†dq
(6.4.1)
on the quaternionic Stiefel bundle SH(1, k + 1) and pull it back via a family of
classifying mappings f : S4 →HPk. If this family is suitable, this yields a family of
(anti-)self-dual Sp(1)-connections on P. Here, q ∈S4k+3, that is,
q = (q0, . . . , qk) ∈Hk+1 \ {0} ,
∥q ∥= 1 .
Recall that for a classifying mapping f : S4 →HPk, the pullback bundle is given by
P ≡f ∗(SH(1, k + 1)) =

([(x1, x2)], q) ∈HP1 × S4k+3 : f ([(x1, x2)]) = πc(q)

.
The pullback of ωc reads
ω = f∗ωc = f df ,
(6.4.2)
with the bundle morphism
f = pr2 ◦iP ,
(6.4.3)
where pr2 is the projection onto the second factor in HP1 × S4k+3 and iP : P →
HP1 × S4k+3 denotes the natural inclusion mapping. To summarize, we have the
commutative diagram

Now, the basic idea of the authors of [35] was to consider the following smooth
family of linear mappings
v : H2 →L(Hk, Hk+1) ,
v(x1, x2) := Cx1 + Dx2 ,
(6.4.4)
where C and D are constant ((k+1)×k)-matrices with quaternionic entries, fulﬁlling
(a) rankHv(x1, x2) = k for all (x1, x2) ∈H2 \ {0},
(b) v†(x1, x2)v(x1, x2) is real for all (x1, x2) ∈H2.
By property (a), the image im(v(x1, x2)) of the linear mapping
v(x1, x2) : Hk →Hk+1
(6.4.5)
is a k-dimensional subspace of Hk+1 which clearly depends on [(x1, x2)] ∈HP1
only. Thus, it deﬁnes a vector subbundle
E :=

[(x1,x2)]∈HP1
im

v([(x1, x2)])

of rank k of the trivial quaternionic vector bundle
E0 = HP1 × Hk+1 →HP1 .
By construction, E is the direct sum of quaternionic line bundles, deﬁned by the
columns of v. Next, let im

v([(x1, x2)])
⊥∼= coker

v([(x1, x2)])

be the (one-
dimensional) quaternionic orthogonal complement of im

in Hk+1.
Clearly,

(6.4.6)
is a vector subbundle of E0 of rank 1, that is, L is a quaternionic line bundle over
HP1. By construction, E and L are complementary in E0,
E0 = E ⊕L .
Let us denote the orthogonal projectors corresponding to this splitting by

6.4 The ADHM Construction

Remark 6.4.1 By Example 1.2.9/2, L is associated with the bundle of orthonor-
mal frames O(L) of L. This is a principal Sp(1)-bundle over HP1 whose ﬁbre over
[(x1, x2)] may be identiﬁed with the vectors e([(x1, x2)]) ∈Hk+1 fulﬁlling
e([(x1, x2)])†v([(x1, x2)]) = 0 ,
e([(x1, x2)])†e([(x1, x2)]) = 1 .
(6.4.7)

The mapping v deﬁnes a smooth classifying mapping
u : HP1 →GH(1, k + 1) ∼= HPk ,
u([(x1, x2)]) := im

v([(x1, x2)])
⊥.
According to the idea spelled out at the beginning, we take the pullback bundle
P = u∗(SH(1, k + 1)) and the corresponding pullback of the canonical connection
via the induced mapping u : P →S4k+3,
ω = u∗ωc = u† du .
(6.4.8)
Then, the curvature of ω is given by
Ω = du† ∧du + u†du ∧u†du .
(6.4.9)
On the other hand, by deﬁnition of P, the elements ([(x1, x2)], q) ∈P are exactly
those fulﬁlling q ∈S4k+3 ∩

im

v([(x1, x2)])

, that is, q is an orthonormal frame

(6.4.10)
By (6.4.3), under the identiﬁcation P ∼= O(L) the mapping u becomes the identity
onto its image, that is, it sends a point p ∈P, viewed as an orthonormal frame e on L,
onto itself as an element of S4k+3. Thus, we can write
ωe = e†de ,
Ωe = de† ∧de + e†de ∧e†de .
(6.4.11)
Moreover, under this identiﬁcation, the projectors Q and P lift to orthogonal
projection-valued mappings on O(L),
ˆQ(e) = 1 −e e† ,
ˆP(e) = e e† .
(6.4.12)
In this picture, the covariant derivative deﬁned by ω is given as follows. Using
(1.2.11), (1.4.2) and the isomorphism (6.4.10), we obtain
(∇Φ)(π(e)) = e(d ˜Φ + e†de ˜Φ) = e e†d(e ˜Φ) = PdΦ .
Thus,

492
6
The Yang-Mills Equation
∇= P ◦d .
(6.4.13)
This formula has a nice geometric interpretation: we take the covariant derivative d
in E0, corresponding to the trivial ﬂat connection, and project it onto L.
Lemma 6.4.2 We have
Ωe = e†( ˆPd ˆP ∧d ˆP ˆP) e .
Proof Since e†e = 1, we get
(de†) e + e†de = 0 .
Using this, we calculate
ˆPd ˆP ∧d ˆP ˆP = e

e†d(e e†) ∧d(e e†)e

In view of (6.4.11), this yields the assertion.
■
Comparing with (1.5.13), we see that the curvature endomorphism form R∇acting
on L associated with Ω is given by
R∇= PdP ∧dPP .
(6.4.14)
The proof of the following proposition can be found in various (similar) versions in
the literature, see [30], [138], [135] and further references therein.
Proposition 6.4.3 The connection ω on P is self-dual and has the instanton number
k(P) = k.
Proof By condition (b) above, the mapping R : HP1 →Aut(Hk) deﬁned by
R([(x1, x2)]) := v†([(x1, x2)])v([(x1, x2)])
(6.4.15)
has real-valued entries, that is, the entries are proportional to 1 ∈H. Now, by the ﬁrst
equation in (6.4.7), we have v†e = 0 and, thus, also vR−1v†e = 0. But, by (6.4.15),
vR−1v† = vR−1v†vR−1v† ,
that is, vR−1v† projects onto the subspace orthogonal to e. Thus, it must coincide
with Q and we obtain pointwise
1 −P = Q = vR−1v† .
(6.4.16)
Calculating

6.4 The ADHM Construction
493
dP = −dQ = −(dv)R−1v† −v(dR−1)v† −vR−1dv† ,
and, using Pv = 0, we get
PdP = −P(dv)R−1v† .
Correspondingly,
dPP = −vR−1(dv†)P .
Inserting these formulae into (6.4.14), we obtain
R∇= P(dv)R−1 ∧(dv†)P .
(6.4.17)
Now, under the conformal identiﬁcation HP1 ∼= H∪{∞} given by the stereographic
projection chart ϕs, elements [(x1, x2)] ∈HP1 \ {∞} are represented by the homo-
geneous coordinate [(1, x2)] ≡x ∈H. This yields
v(x) = C + Dx
(6.4.18)
and, thus, dv = D dx. Finally, using the fact that R commutes with dv, we see that
R∇is proportional to dx ∧dx, that is, ω is self-dual.
The second statement follows immediately from the Whitney Sum Formula,
cf. Theorem 4.3.2. In more detail, to prove that the second Chern class of L is
equal to k, it is enough to show that the second Chern class of E is equal to −k. But,
by construction, E is the direct sum of k quaternionic line bundles corresponding to
the k column vectors of v. Each of them may be identiﬁed with the standard line
bundle over HP1 having the second Chern class −1.
■
Thus, the above construction yields instantons. We get anti-instantons, if we choose
instead
v(x) = C + D x ,
(6.4.19)
see also Remark 6.4.6 below.
Our next task is to count the number of independent solutions. For that purpose
we bring v into a normal form. Without loss of generality, we may assume that v is
given by (6.4.18).
Proposition 6.4.4 The following transformations yield isomorphic bundles and,
consequently, isomorphic self-dual connections:
C →QCK ,
D →QDK ,
(6.4.20)
where Q ∈Sp(k + 1) and K ∈GL(k, R). Using these transformations, e →Qe and
the mapping v can be brought to the following canonical form:

The Yang-Mills Equation
v(x) =

λ
B −x1

,
(6.4.21)
where λ is a quaternionic (1 × k)-vector and B is a quaternionic symmetric (k × k)-
matrix. The canonical form (6.4.21) is preserved by the transformations (6.4.20)
fulﬁlling
Q =

a 0
0 R

,
K = RT ,
where a ∈Sp(1) , R ∈O(k) .
(6.4.22)
Proof First, restricting to constant matrices is necessary to respect the linear structure
of the construction. Next, by the ﬁrst equation of (6.4.7), v and e can be multiplied
from the left by the same matrix Q only. The second equation in (6.4.7) implies that
Q must belong to Sp(k + 1). Finally, to preserve the reality condition (b), v can be
multiplied only by a matrix K ∈GL(k, R). To prove that these transformations yield
isomorphic bundles and connections is a simple exercise left to the reader.
Next, webringv toanormal form. First, thereal symmetricmatrix D†D transforms
under (6.4.20) to KT(D†D)K. Thus, we can use K to diagonalize D†D and afterwards
rescale the diagonal entries to 1. This yields D†D = 1k. Clearly, this condition is
invariant under any transformation D 
→DK, with K ∈O(k). Next, one easily
shows (Exercise 6.4.1) that for any D fulﬁlling D†D = 1k there exists an element
Q ∈Sp(k + 1) such that
D = Q†

 0
−1k

.
(6.4.23)
Moreover, writing
C = Q†

λ
B

,
where λ is a (1×k)- and B is a (k ×k)-block, we have D†C = −B. But, by condition
(b), D†C is symmetric and, thus, B must be symmetric, too.

The conditions (a) and (b) now read

Now, we can calculate the number of free parameters labelling the ADHM solutions
modulo the transformations (6.4.20), that is, the number of free real parameters in
Vk/(Sp(1) × O(k)) with the action given by (6.4.22). Since the stabilizer of this
action is

{(1, 1), (−1, −1)} ∼= Z2 ,
this number is given by dimR(Vk) −dim

Sp(1) × O(k)

. The vectors λ contain 4k
real parameters and the matrices B, being symmetric, contain 4 k(k+1)

real parameters.
Since the matrix λ†λ + B†B is self-adjoint and has positive diagonal entries, the
condition that it be real gives rise to 3 k(k−1)
2
independent equations. Finally, the
property of maximal rank is generic. Thus, altogether, for the number of free real
parameters we obtain

(6.4.24)
Thus, we have the following.
Corollary 6.4.5 The space Mk of Sp(1)-instanton solutions on S4 obtained via the
ADHM construction may be identiﬁed with Vk factorized with respect to the free
action of (Sp(1) × O(k))/Z2. It is a smooth (8k −3)-dimensional manifold.
Remark 6.4.6 Itisobviousfromtheabovepresentation,thattheADHM-construction
immediatelygeneralizestoanySp(n),n > 1.Asalreadyoutlinedintheoriginalpaper
[35], it can be adapted to the case of the classical groups SU(n) and SO(n) as well,
see also [162], [138], [99] and [442] for details.
♦
Now, we can solve the ﬁrst equation in (6.4.7) for e and we can, in principle, ﬁnd
the explicit k-instanton solution. For that purpose, we parameterize the local section
x →e(x) as follows:
e(x) =
1
√ρ(x)

 −1
U(x)

,
where U is a quaternionic (k × 1)-block and ρ(x) = 1 + ∥U(x)∥2. Then, the ﬁrst
equation of (6.4.7) implies
U(x) =

λ(B −x1)−1† .
(6.4.25)
Inserting this into the ﬁrst equation of (6.4.11), we obtain the following k-instanton
solution on H = R4:
A(x) = Im

U†(x)dU(x)

1 + ∥U(x)∥2
.
(6.4.26)
Clearly, it may be difﬁcult to calculate the inverse matrix (B −x1)−1 for large n
explicitly. Moreover, we note that e and, thus, A may have apparent singularities.
However, these singularities may be removed (shifted to inﬁnity) by appropriate
gauge transformations. Behind, there is a standard procedure in algebraic geometry,
seee.g.[259].Forthecaseunderconsideration,seealso[191],[244]andtheexamples

The calculations in the following examples are left to the reader (Exercise 6.4.2).

The apparent singularity at x = x0 may be removed by the gauge transformation

A(x; λ, x0) = Im
	
(x −x0) dx

.
(6.4.27)
This is the k = +1-counterpart of (6.3.23). Setting λ = 1 and x0 = 0 we get the
BPST-instanton.
2. If we choose B = diag(x1, . . . , xk), where x0, . . . , xk are distinct points in H,
and λ = (λ11, . . . , λk1), with λi > 0, then we obtain the 't Hooft multi instanton
solutions [627] in the singular gauge:
A(x; λi, xi) = −

Clearly, this is a 5k-parameter family of self-dual solutions.

Fig. 6.2 Equivalences used in the proof that the ADHM construction yields all instantons on S4
It turns out that Mk is the full moduli space of k-instantons, that is, by the ADHM-
construction, all instantons on S4 are obtained. The proof of this fact rests on the
following deep results:
1. One reformulates the ADHM-construction in terms of complex geometry on the
twistorspaceCP3.Then,itappearsastheHorrocksconstruction[311],[312]from
algebraic geometry yielding algebraic16 and, thus, holomorphic vector bundles
over CP3 of a special type.
2. By the Atiyah-Ward correspondence, holomorphic vector bundles over CP3 of
this type are in one-to-one correspondence with instantons on S4, see [42], [37]
and [30]. We also refer to [58] for a detailed proof.
3. Using results of Barth and Hulek [55-57], one shows that all algebraic vector
bundles over CP3 of this special type are obtained via the Horrocks construction.
Figure6.2 shows the logic of the proof schematically.
We explain points 1 and 2in some detail. Point 3 is beyond the scope of this book.
As before, we limit our attention to the gauge group Sp(1) ∼= SU(2). First, we
need some algebraic preliminaries. As explained in Appendix A, we identify C with
span{1, i} ⊂H and H with C2 by writing quaternions in the form z1 + jz2, for any
z1 , z2 ∈C. This implies a complex isomorphism Hk ∼= Ck ⊕j Ck and, identifying
z1 + j z2 = (z1, z2), we get
Hk ∼= Ck ⊕j Ck ∼= C2k .
(6.4.30)
16That is, the transition functions may be chosen to be rational functions of the complex coordinates.

498

The Yang-Mills Equation
Let us denote the standard scalar products on Hk and C2k by k and h, respectively,
and let us choose the following skew form on C2k:
J =

 0 1
−1 0

.
(6.4.31)
We have
k(q1, q2) = q†
1q2 ,
h(z, w) = z†w ,
J(z, w) = zTJw ,
where q1, q2, z and w are viewed as column vectors. These structures are related as
follows:
k(q1, q2) = h(z, w) + j J(z, w) ,
(6.4.32)
where q1 = z1 + j z2 , q2 = w1 + j w2 and z = (z1, z2) , w = (w1, w2).
Next,letσ : Hk →Hk bethecomplexanti-linearisomorphisminducedfromright
multiplication on Hk by j. Then, σ 2 = −id and, under the isomorphism (6.4.30),
σ(z1 + j z2) = −z2 + j z1 = (−z2, z1) .
(6.4.33)
Thus, in the above bases, viewing z ∈C2k as a row vector,
σ(z) = zJ .
(6.4.34)
Finally, we note that σ relates h and J as follows
h(σ(z), w) = J(z, w) .
(6.4.35)
Remark 6.4.8 In the sequel, given a complex vector space V , an anti-linear isomor-
phism σ : V →V fulﬁlling σ 2 = id or σ 2 = −id will be called, respectively, a real
or a symplectic structure17 of V , cf. also Sect.5.3.
♦
Now let us consider the isomorphism (6.4.30) for k = 2, that is, H2 ∼= C4 together
with the corresponding right projective spaces HP1 and CP3. Using the above con-
ventions, for z, z′ ∈C2, we write z + j z′ = (z, z′) and thus, denoting z = (z1, z2)
and z′ = (z3, z4), elements of C4 are parameterized as follows:
(z1 + j z3, z2 + j z4) = (z1, z2, z3, z4) .
Clearly, any complex line is contained in a quaternionic line. Thus, we obtain the
following ﬁbre bundle
π : CP3 →HP1 .
(6.4.36)
17This is the terminology of complex geometry. Instead, we could call σ a quaternionic structure
in that case.

6.4 The ADHM Construction
499
The mapping π is called the (projective) Penrose twistor transformation [508] for S4
and the bundle is called the projective twistor bundle. Consider a quaternionic line
and view it as a copy of C2. Then, all complex lines in it form a copy of CP1. Thus,
the ﬁbres of π are copies of CP1. In terms of the above coordinates, the projection
π is given by
π([(z1, z2, z3, z4)]) = [(z1 + j z3, z2 + j z4)] .
(6.4.37)
The symplectic structure σ on C4 descends to a mapping of CP3, denoted by the
same symbol,
σ : CP3 →CP3 ,
σ([(z1, z2, z3, z4)]) = [(−z3, −z4, z1, z2)] ,
(6.4.38)
which is anti-linear in homogeneous coordinates and fulﬁls σ 2 = id. It is common
to call such a mapping a real structure on CP3. By deﬁnition, σ acts trivially on HP1
and, thus, it preserves the ﬁbre structure.
Under the above identiﬁcation H2 ∼= C4, the natural action of SL(2, H) on H2
descends to an action on CP3 preserving the ﬁbration (6.4.36) and projecting onto
the conformal action on HP1, see Appendix B. Thus, the maximal compact subgroup
Sp(2) ⊂SL(2, H) acts transitively on CP3 preserving the natural metrics on CP3
and HP1. In coordinates, writing
[(z1 + j z3, z2 + j z4)] = [(1, (z2 + j z4)(z1 + j z3)−1] ≡[(1, x)] ,
and calculating (z2 + j z4)(z1 + j z3) = (z1z2 + z3z4) + j (z1z4 −z3z2) , we ﬁnd the
following presentation of the ﬁbre π−1([(1, x)]) over [(1, x)]: it consists of elements
[(z1, . . . , z4)] ∈CP3 fulﬁlling the conditions
ζ = z1z2 + z3z4
|z1|2 + |z3|2 ,
ξ = z1z4 −z3z2
|z1|2 + |z3|2 ,
x = ζ + jξ .
(6.4.39)
Thus, for the points in the ﬁbre π−1([(1, 0)]), we read off the stabilizer U(1) ×
Sp(1) ⊂Sp(2). By a similar calculation, for the ﬁbre π−1([(0, 1)]), we obtain
the stabilizer Sp(1) × U(1). This yields the following presentations of CP3 as a
homogeneous space:
CP3 ∼= Sp(2)/(U(1) × Sp(1)) ,
CP3 ∼= Sp(2)/(Sp(1) × U(1)) .
(6.4.40)
Remark 6.4.9
1. By Example 5.4.9, HP1 ∼= S4 ∼= Sp(2)/(Sp(1)×Sp(1)). Thus, the homogeneous
presentation (6.4.40) of CP3 explicitly shows that the ﬁbres of π are copies of
Sp(1)/U(1) ∼= CP1 .

500
6
The Yang-Mills Equation
Identifying CP1 ∼= S2 in the standard way18 via (ζ, ξ) 
→(2ζξ, |ζ|2 −|ξ|2) , we
read off that σ acts on the ﬁbres via
σ(ζ, ξ) 
→(−2ζξ, |ξ|2 −|ζ|2) ,
that is, it sends any point to its antipodal point. Recall that a projective line in
CP3 is the image of a 2-dimensional subspace of C4. By deﬁnition, a projective
line is said to be a real line if it is invariant under σ. Thus the ﬁbres of π are
exactly the real lines in CP3 and S4 may be viewed as the parameter space of the
real lines.
2. Comparing with Example 5.5.14, we see that CP3 may be naturally identiﬁed
with the negative projective spinor bundle P−(S4).19 Via this identiﬁcation, it
obtains a natural complex structure such that the orientation induced on S4 is
opposite to the original orientation of S4, cf. Remark 5.5.8.20 In the sequel, we
assume that CP3 is endowed with this complex structure.
♦
Now, recall that the ADHM-data are given by mappings
v : H2 →L(Hk, Hk+1) ,
v(x1, x2) := Cx1 + Dx2 ,
cf. (6.4.4), where C and D are constant (k + 1) × k-matrices with quaternionic
entries, fulﬁlling conditions (a) and (b). Using (6.4.30) for k = 2, we may view v as
a mapping
v : C4 →L(Hk, Hk+1) .
Explicitly, writing x1 = z1 + j z3 and x2 = z2 + j z4, we obtain
v(z) = Cz1 + C j z3 + Dz2 + D j z4 ≡v1z1 + v2z2 + v3z3 + v4z4 ,
with
C = 1
2(v1 −v3 j) ,
D = 1
2(v2 −v4 j) ,
(6.4.41)
and
v1 + v3j = 0 ,
v2 + v4j = 0 .

19Clearly, it may also be identiﬁed with the positive projective spinor bundle.
20If we adopt this point of view, Theorem 4.1 of [37] cited in Remark 5.5.8 guarantees the integrabil-
ity of the almost complex structure constructed there. Clearly, given the homogeneous presentation
(6.4.40) one can deﬁne the almost complex structure in terms of the corresponding Lie algebra
decomposition. Then, checking the integrability is a purely algebraic task, see [218] for details.

we obtain a mapping
A : C4 →L(W, V ) ,
A(z) = A1z1 + A2z2 + A3z3 + A4z4 ,
(6.4.44)
where W = Ck and V = C2k+2. In this presentation, the conditions (6.4.42) take the
form
JA3 = A1 ,
JA4 = A2 ,
(6.4.45)
where J is the skew form on V given by (6.4.31). We endow V with the symplec-
tic structure σ given by (6.4.34) and W with the real structure given by complex
conjugation.
Lemma 6.4.10 The quaternionic ADHM mappings given by (6.4.4) and fulﬁlling
conditions (a) and (b) are in one-to-one correspondence with mappings (6.4.44)
fulﬁlling the following conditions:
σ(A(z)w) = A(σ(z))w ,
w ∈W ,
(6.4.46)
dimC (im A(z)) = k ,
z ̸= 0 ,
(6.4.47)
A(z)TJA(z) = 0 .
(6.4.48)
Mappings A fulﬁlling the conditions (6.4.46)-(6.4.48) will be referred to as complex
ADHM data.
Proof To show (6.4.46), using (6.4.34) and (6.4.45), we calculate
σ(A(z)w) = −JA(z)w = (A3z1 + A4z2 −A1z3 −A2z4)w = A(σ(z))w .
Next, (6.4.47) is an immediate consequence of condition (a). Finally, we analyze
condition (b). For that purpose, consider any pair (i, l) of columns of v(x1, x2) and
decompose them according to (6.4.43),

502
6
The Yang-Mills Equation
and the reality condition (b) yields
J(Ai, Al) = 0 ,
for any pair (i, l). This is equivalent to (6.4.48).
Inverting the above reformulation yields the converse statement.
■
Remark 6.4.11 Condition (6.4.47) is equivalent to the statement that im A(z) is an
isotropic subspace of V with respect to J,21
im A(z) ⊂(im A(z))J ,
z ̸= 0 .
(6.4.49)
Here, (im A(z))J is the J-orthogonal complement.
♦
Deﬁnition 6.4.12 A holomorphic symplectic involution on a holomorphic vector
bundle L over CP3 is a holomorphic isomorphism22 τ : L →σ ∗L with τ 2 = −id,
where τ 2 := σ ∗(τ) ◦τ.
Remark 6.4.13 We explain the bundle σ ∗L in some detail. For the canonical cover-
ing {Uα} of CP3 by homogeneous coordinates, deﬁned by Uα := {[z] ∈CP3 : zα ̸=
0}, we denote σ(1) = 3, σ(2) = 4, σ(3) = 1 and σ(4) = 2. Then, σ −1(Uα) = Uσ(α).
Now, given a holomorphic cocycle {gαβ} associated with the covering {Uα}, the bun-
dle σ ∗L has the holomorphic cocycle {gσ
αβ} deﬁned by
gσ
αβ := gσ(α)σ(β) ◦σ .
Correspondingly, there is an anti-linear bundle isomorphism L ∼= σ ∗L .
♦
The following construction is due to Horrocks [311], [312].
Proposition 6.4.14 (Horrocks construction) Any linear mapping A : W →V , ful-
ﬁlling the conditions (6.4.46)-(6.4.48), gives rise to a holomorphic vector bundle L
of rank 2 over CP3 with the following properties.
1. L is holomorphically trivial over each ﬁbre of π.
2. There exists a holomorphic symplectic involution on L .
A holomorphic vector bundle L over CP3 with the properties 1 and 2 is usually
referred to as an instanton bundle.
Proof Let there be given a linear mapping A : W →V , fulﬁlling the conditions
(6.4.46)-(6.4.48). Recall that V is endowed with the skew form J given by (6.4.31),
with the symplectic structure σ and with the natural Hermitean form h, fulﬁlling the
compatibility condition (6.4.35). Take the vector spaces
21Cf. Deﬁnition I/7.2.2.
22L denotes the bundle conjugate to L . Note that σ ∗L is a holomorphic bundle, because σ is
anti-holomorphic, and σ ∗σ ∗L = L .

6.4 The ADHM Construction
503
Ez := im A(z) ,
E 0
z := (im A(z))J
(6.4.50)
and the quotient space
Lz := (im A(z))J / im A(z) .
(6.4.51)
Since dimC (im A(z)) = k, we have dimC (im A(z))J = k + 2 and, thus, dimC Lz =
2. Clearly, Lz inherits a non-degenerate skew form from J. By construction, the
subspaces Ez, E 0
z and Lz depend on [z] ∈CP3 only. Thus, the subspaces E[z] and
E 0
[z] combine to vertical subbundles
E :=

[z]∈CP3
E[z] ,
E 0 :=

[z]∈CP3
E 0
[z]
of the trivial holomorphic vector bundle V := CP3 ×V endowed with the Hermitean
ﬁbre metric h and the skew form J inherited from V . Consequently, the quotient
spaces L[z] combine to the quotient vector bundle
L :=

[z]∈CP3
L[z] = E 0/E .
(6.4.52)
We may identify L with the orthogonal complement of E in E 0 ⊂V , which we
also denote by L . By general arguments [583], as an algebraic vector bundle, L
carries a holomorphic structure.
Next, by (6.4.35), the orthogonal complement E ⊥
[z] of E[z] ⊂V coincides with
(σ(E[z]))0 and by (6.4.46), we have
σ(E[z]) = Eσ([z]) .
(6.4.53)
Thus,
E 0
[z] = E ⊥
σ([z]) ,
(6.4.54)
and, by the positive deﬁniteness of the inner product, E 0
[z] ∩Eσ([z]) = 0. Thus,
V = Eσ([z]) ⊕E ⊥
σ([z]) = Eσ([z]) ⊕E 0
[z]
and,viewingL[z] astheorthogonalcomplementofE[z] inE 0

orthogonal direct sum decomposition
V = E[z] ⊕L[z] ⊕Eσ([z]) ,
(6.4.55)
together with the corresponding splitting of the trivial bundle V . Thus,
L[z] = {v ∈V : h(v, u) = 0 , J(v, u) = 0 , for all u ∈im(A(z))} ,
(6.4.56)

504
6
The Yang-Mills Equation
that is,
L[z] = E ⊥
[z] ∩E ⊥
σ([z]) = E 0
σ([z]) ∩E 0
[z] .
We show that L[z] depends only on x = π([z]) ∈HP1, that is, on the ﬁbre through
[z]. According to Remark 6.4.9, the latter coincides with the real line lx through [z]
and σ([z]). Let [w] be any point on lx and let L[w], L[z] and Lσ([z]) be the complex
lines through zero in C4 corresponding to [w], [z] and σ([z]), respectively. Any
vector w ∈L[w] is a linear combination of a vector in L[z] and a vector in Lσ([z]),
because L[z] and Lσ([z]) span a two-dimensional plane (containing zero) in C4 and
L[w] rotates from L[z] to Lσ([z]) when [w] runs from [z] to σ([z]). Thus, since A(w)
depends linearly on w, we obtain
E 0
[w] ∩E 0
[z] = E 0
[w] ∩E 0
σ([z]) = E 0
σ([z]) ∩E 0
[z] .
As a result, the two-dimensional subspace
Rx = E 0
σ([z]) ∩E 0
[z] ⊂V
is the complement of E[w] in E 0
[w] for any [w] ∈lx. Thus, the restriction of L to lx is
trivial with the ﬁbre given by Rx and the holomorphic structure induced from Rx.
Finally, the anti-linear automorphism σ of C2k+2 deﬁnes an anti-holomorphic
vector bundle automorphism of V covering σ : CP3 →CP3 by
σ : V →V ,
σ([z], v) :=

σ([z]), σ(v)

.
(6.4.57)
Thus, by (6.4.53) and (6.4.55), σ induces an anti-holomorphic vector bundle auto-
morphism of L covering σ, which we denote by the same symbol:
σ : L →L ,
σ([z], v) := (σ([z]), σ(v)) ,
v ∈Rπ([z]) .
Now, the desired holomorphic symplectic involution of L is obtained by combining
this automorphism with the anti-linear bundle isomorphism σ ∗L ∼= L explained
in Remark 6.4.13.
■
Remark 6.4.15
1. Since (6.4.55) is an orthogonal direct sum decomposition, Rx inherits a positive
Hermitean inner product from h on V . Identifying the restriction of L to a real
line lx with Rx, we obtain a positive Hermitean inner product on the space of
sections.
2. Property 1 of L can be interpreted in terms of characteristic classes. By a theorem
of Grothendieck [265], every holomorphic vector bundle of rank n over CP1
is isomorphic to a direct sum of line bundles Lki = L ⊗. . . ⊗L (ki times),
where L denotes the (unique up to isomorphisms) holomorphic line bundle over
CP1and the integers (k1, . . . , kn) are unique up to permutation. These integers

6.4 The ADHM Construction
505
are holomorphic but not topological invariants. Only their sum is a topological
invariant. Thus, since L is of rank 2, restricted to a real line it is isomorphic
to a direct sum Lk1 ⊕Lk2 of holomorphic line bundles. Now, property 1 implies
k1 = k2 = 0. Thus, in particular, k1 + k2 = 0, that is, the ﬁrst Chern class of L
vanishes.23 As a consequence, the instanton number k (the second Chern class)
is the only topological invariant of L . For further details, we refer to [30].
3. Given a bundle L obtained from complex ADHM data via the Horrocks construc-
tion, we can work back through Lemma 6.4.10 to recover the explicit construction
of instantons in terms of the quaternionic data. Indeed, by (6.4.56) and (6.4.32),
Rx coincides with im(v(π(z)))⊥. Thus,

of algebraic vector bundles over M fulﬁlling β ◦α = 0. The algebraic vector
bundle ker β/ im α is called the cohomology of the monad. In our case, M = CP3

where j is the natural inclusion mapping and J is viewed as a homomorphism

= (im j)J, we ﬁnd that the instanton bundle L
coincides with the cohomology of this monad. This is the approriate language
for accomplishing the proof of point 3in the introduction. For details, see Chap.
VII in [30].

Next, consider a self-dual connection ω on a principal Sp(1)-bundle P over HP1
given in terms of its quaternionic ADHM data. Let L be the associated quaternionic
line bundle given by the basic representation and let ∇be the covariant derivative of
ω. Then, L carries a ﬁbre metric induced from the quaternionic scalar product on H
which is compatible with ∇. By ﬁeld restriction, L becomes a complex Hermitean
23See also [42] for a semicontinuity argument. Alternatively, one may deduce c1(L ) = 0 from
property 1 of L by observing that any ﬁbre of π represents a generator of H2(CP3).

The Yang-Mills Equation
vector bundle with structure group SU(2) over S4. The following theorem covers the
more general case of a Hermitean vector bundle of arbitrary rank.
Theorem 6.4.16 (Atiyah-Ward) Let (L, h) be a Hermitean vector bundle over S4
endowed with a self-dual metric connection ∇and let π : CP3 →S4 be the projective
twistor bundle. Let CP3 be endowed with the complex structure induced via the
identiﬁcation with the negative projective spinor bundle of S4 and let σ be the real
structure on CP3 given by (6.4.38). Then, the pullback bundle L := π∗L carries
a natural holomorphic structure and a holomorphic isomorphism τ : σ ∗L →L ∗
fulﬁlling:
1. L is holomorphically trivial on each ﬁbre of π.
2. The holomorphic isomorphism τ induces a positive deﬁnite Hermitean structure
on the space of holomorphic sections of L over each ﬁbre of π.
Conversely, every such bundle over CP3 is the pullback of a bundle L with self-dual
connection over S4.
Proof The Hermitean ﬁbre metric h of L induces a Hermitean ﬁbre metric ˜h on L
and, with respect to this ﬁbre metric, ˜∇= π∗∇is a Hermitean connection on L .
If ω and Ω are the connection form and the curvature of ∇, then ˜ω = π∗ω and
˜Ω = π∗Ω are the connection and the curvature of ˜∇, respectively. By Corollary
2.8.3, any 2-form on R4 is anti-self-dual iff it is of type (1, 1) for some (and hence
for all) compatible complex structures. Combining this with the fact that the complex
structure chosen on CP3 reverses the orientation of S4, we conclude that ˜Ω is of type
(1, 1). Now, Theorem 2.6.12 implies that L admits a holomorphic structure such
that ˜∇is the canonical connection, that is, ˜∇is of type (1, 0).
We show that L is holomorphically trivial over each ﬁbre of π. Thus, let x ∈S4.
Every basis {eα}, α = 1, . . . , k, of the ﬁbre Lx induces a frame {˜eα} in L↾π−1(x) via
[z] 
→˜eα([z]) := ([z], eα). It is enough to prove that the sections ˜eα are holomorphic.
Since ˜ω isthepullbackofω underπ,theelementsoftheinducedframearecovariantly
constant along π−1(x). Indeed, by Proposition 1.5.3,
˜∇˜eα =
˜
A β
α ˜eβ =

π∗A β
α

˜eβ ,
where A and
˜
A are the local representatives of ω and ˜ω, respectively. Thus, ˜∇˜eα is
annihilated by any vector tangent to π−1(x). Now, decomposing ˜eα = 
β aαβ hβ in
a local holomorphic frame {hα} in L↾π−1(x), we have
˜∇˜eα =

β
(daαβ)hβ +

β
aαβ ˜∇hβ = 0 .
Decomposing the above sum into its (1, 0) and (0, 1)-parts and using that ˜∇is
a (1, 0)-connection, we read off that the (0, 1)-component is 
β(∂aαβ)hβ. Now,
vanishing of this quantity implies that the functions aαβ must be holomorphic.

6.4 The ADHM Construction
507
Next, the anti-linear involution σ on CP3 and the Hermitean ﬁbre metric ˜h on L
yield a bundle isomorphism24
τ : σ ∗L →L ∗:
τ
 
α
wα˜eα(σ([z]))

:=

α
wα˜e∗
α([z]) .
(6.4.60)
Here, {˜eα} is a local orthonormal frame with respect to ˜h of L obtained via pullback
from a local orthonormal frame {eα} of L and {˜e∗
α} is the dual coframe. To prove that
this isomorphism is holomorphic, we must show that τ maps (1, 0)-forms on σ ∗L
to (1, 0)-forms on L ∗. By the proof of Theorem 2.6.12, the complex structure on
L ∗is locally deﬁned by the forms
(dzj, dwα + Bα
βwβ) ,
B :=
˜
A 0,1 .
Since the forms dwα + Bαβwβ are pullbacks under π, they are invariant under σ.
Thus, the complex structure on σ ∗L is given by (dzj, dwα + B
α
β wβ). Using the
Hermiticity condition Bαβ = −Bβα, it reads
(dzj, dwα −Bβ
α wβ).
Now we must apply τ. Using τ(dwα) = dwα and τ(λdzj) = λdzj, we get
(dzj, dwα −Bβ
α wβ)
which coincides with the complex structure of L ∗, because the induced connection
on the dual bundle is given by the negative transpose.
Finally, since L is holomorphically trivial over each ﬁbre, we may use τ to deﬁne
a Hermitean structure on the space of holomorphic sections of L over each ﬁbre:
⟨s1, s2⟩([z]) := τ

s2(σ([z]))

s1([z])

,
where z ∈π−1(x) and s1 and s2 are holomorphic sections over π−1(x). Then, by
Deﬁnition (6.4.60), we have ⟨s1, s2⟩(z) = ˜h

s1([z]), s2([z])

, showing that ⟨·, ·⟩is
positive deﬁnite and Hermitean.
For the proof of the converse statement, we refer to the proof of Theorem 5.2 of
[37].
■
Remark 6.4.17 Theorem 6.4.16 is one way of spelling out what usually is referred to
as the Atiyah-Ward correspondence [42]. It generalizes immediately to Hermitean
vector bundles with self-dual connection over any self-dual 4-manifold [37]. Then,
CP3 must be replaced by the projective spinor bundle P−(M), cf. Remark 5.5.8.
♦
Now, by a theorem of Serre [583], [582], any holomorphic vector bundle over a
complex algebraic variety in a projective space is algebraic and, thus, combining the

The Yang-Mills Equation
results presented above with point 3 of the programme outlined at the beginning,
we obtain that the ADHM construction yields all instantons on S4. Thus, we get the
following fundamental theorem.
Theorem 6.4.18 (Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin) For a Yang-Mills theory on S4
with gauge group Sp(1), every k-instanton arises from the parameters (λ, B) sat-
isfying conditions (a) and (b). In an asymptotic gauge, using the conformal iden-
tiﬁcation S4 ∼= H ∪{∞}, the solution is given by formula (6.4.26) with U deﬁned
by (6.4.25). Gauge equivalent potentials are described by transformations (6.4.20)
fulﬁlling (6.4.22).
For the full proof we refer to [35], [162], [163] and to [30] for a detailed presentation.
Remark 6.4.19 This classiﬁcation result generalizes to any classical compact Lie
group, see [164] for details. There, ﬁrst the group G = O(n) was treated. Then,
the instantons for the groups U(n) and Sp(n) were viewed as O(2n)- and O(4n)-
instantons, respectively, equipped with an additional structure.

the (k ×k)-block of Q. Show that D†D = 1k guarantees that this ﬁxing is compatible
with the requirement that Q be an element of Sp(k + 1).

6.4.3 Prove formula (6.4.46).
6.5
The Instanton Moduli Space
In this section, we study the moduli space of all instanton solutions. For a given
principal bundle P(M, G) with instanton number k > 0, it is deﬁned as
Mk := {[ω] ∈M (P) : ∗Ωω = Ωω} .
(6.5.1)
This deﬁnition makes sense, because local gauge transformations map (anti-)self-
dual connections to (anti-)self-dual connections, cf. Remark 6.2.8. Correspondingly,
we write M−k for anti-instantons.
In the ﬁrst part, we present general results holding for any compact, self-dual
oriented Riemannian manifolds M having an additional property to be speciﬁed
later. First, we limit our attention to the case of irreducible connections. We will see

6.5 The Instanton Moduli Space
509
in Chap.8 that the latter constitute an open set in the space of all connections. Next,
we will concentrate on Sp(1)-connections on S4. For that case, the moduli space will
be described in detail. Finally, we will discuss the role of the reducible connections.
First, we wish to ﬁnd a good candidate for the tangent space of the moduli space.
For that purpose, let p−: 2M ⊗Ad(P) →2
−M ⊗Ad(P) be the projection with
respect to the decomposition 2M = 2
+M ⊕2
−M.
Lemma 6.5.1 Let ω be a self-dual connection on P. Then, each 1-parameter family
t 
→ωt of self-dual connections on P, fulﬁlling ω0 = ω, deﬁnes an element of
ker(p−◦d1
ω) .
Proof Denoting τt = ωt −ω ∈T , by the Structure Equation, we have
Ωt = Ω + dωτt + 1
2[τt, τt] ,
and, by the self-duality requirement,
p−(dωτt + 1
2[τt, τt]) = 0 .
(6.5.2)
Differentiating this equation with respect to t at t = 0 and using τ0 = 0 yields
p−(dω ˙τ) = 0, that is, ˙τ ∈ker(p−◦d1
ω).
■
Now, by (6.1.28), we conclude that ker(p−◦d1
ω)/ im(d0
ω) is a good candidate for the
tangent space to the moduli space. Thus, for a Yang-Mills theory on the principal
bundle P(M, G) endowed with an irreducible self-dual connection ω, we are led to
consider the sequence deﬁned by the differential operators
d0 := d0
ω ,
d1 := p−◦d1
ω .
Lemma 6.5.2 The sequence

d0
−→Ω1(M, Ad(P))
d1
−→Ω2
−(M, Ad(P)) −→0
(6.5.3)
is an elliptic complex of ﬁrst order differential operators.
We denote the elliptic complex (6.5.3) by EYM and call it the Yang-Mills complex.
Proof Since ω is self-dual, using (1.4.12) and (1.5.13), we obtain
d1 ◦d0 = p−◦d1
ω ◦d0
ω = p−

that is, (6.5.3) deﬁnes a complex. To prove that it is elliptic, we have to show that its

ker σ1 ⊂im σ0. Let ϑ1, . . . , ϑ4 be a basis of T∗
mM such that ϑ1 = ξ and let
α =

αi ϑi ∈ker σ1 .
Then, p−(α2 ϑ1 ∧ϑ2 + α3 ϑ1 ∧ϑ3 + α4 ϑ1 ∧ϑ4) = 0. Passing to the basis {ϕ±

deﬁned in Remark 2.8.1, we have

where ϕ±

α2 ϕ−
1 + α3 ϕ−
2 + α4 ϕ−
3 = 0 ,
that is, α2 = α3 = α4 = 0 and, thus, α = α1ϑ1. In particular, we obtain
dim(ker σ1) = 1 .
This implies that σ1 is surjective.

By ellipticity, they are all ﬁnite-dimensional. Clearly, the adjoint of d1 coincides with
the restriction of d∗to Ω2

Moreover, the Hodge Decomposition Theorem 2.7.2 holds,

Thus,
26As a consequence of the regularity of solutions to elliptic equations, these spaces remain
unchanged after completing Ωp(M, Ad(P)) with respect to any Sobolev norm.

p = 0, 1, 2 .
Denote hp
ω := dim(Hp
ω). Comparing the second equation in (6.5.4) with Lemma
6.5.1, we see that the ﬁrst cohomology H1
ω should serve as a model for the tangent
space of the moduli space. The basic idea consists now in showing that h0
ω = 0 = h2
ω.
Then, the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem 5.8.14 for the complex EYM will provide us
with a formula for h1
ω and thus, eventually, for the (virtual) dimension of the moduli
space.
Lemma 6.5.3 For an irreducible self-dual connection ω on a principal bundle
P(M, G) with G being compact and semi-simple, we have
h0
ω = 0 .
Proof By Theorem 6.1.5, H0
ω = ker(d0) coincides with the Lie algebra of the stabi-
lizer of ω and, thus, with the Lie algebra of the centralizer of the holonomy group
of ω in g. By the irreducibility assumption, the centralizer of the holonomy group
coincides with the center of G which, by the assumption of semi-simplicity of G, is
ﬁnite. Thus, its Lie algebra is zero-dimensional.
■
Lemma 6.5.4 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle with a compact and semi-simple
structure group G over a 4-dimensional self-dual compact Riemannian manifold
with positive scalar curvature. Then, for any irreducible self-dual connection ω on
P, we have
h2
ω = 0 .
Proof Since □2 = d1 ◦d∗
1, we have H2
ω ∼= ker(d1 ◦d∗
1). Thus, we have to calculate
d1 ◦d∗
1 = p−◦dω ◦d∗
ω ◦ι−,
where ι−: Ω2
−(M, Ad(P)) →Ω2(M, Ad(P)) is the natural inclusion mapping. Let
α ∈Ω2
−(M, Ad(P)). Then, using ∗α = −α and d∗
ω = −∗◦dω ◦∗, we obtain
⟨dω ◦d∗
ωα, α⟩= ⟨d∗
ωα, d∗
ωα⟩= ⟨dωα, dωα⟩= ⟨d∗
ω ◦dωα, α⟩.
Thus,
d1 ◦d∗
1 = 1
2p−◦□ω ◦ι−,
and we may apply the Weitzenboeck Formula (2.7.63),
□ωα =

∇(ω0+ω)∗∇(ω0+ω)α + α ◦(R + Ric ∧id) + R∇ω(α) ,
(6.5.6)
where ω0 is the Levi-Civita connection of M. The last term in (6.5.6) vanishes,
because the curvature endomorphism of a self-dual connection acts trivially on
Ω2
−(M, Ad(P)). Thus, it remains to calculate the second term of this sum. This is

512
6
The Yang-Mills Equation
most easily done in a local orthonormal frame {ei} on M. Using (2.8.26), we obtain:

α◦(R + Ric ∧id)

(ei, ej)
= ηklα(ek, R(ei, ej)el) + α(Ric(ei), ej) −α(Ric(ej), ei)
= Rklijαkl + ηkl(Rliαlk −Rljαki)
= Sc
3 αij + Wklijαkl ,
where Sc is the scalar curvature of M and W is the Weyl tensor. Since M is self-dual,
W−= 0 and, thus, for α ∈Ω2
−(M, Ad(P)),
□ωα =

∇(ω0+ω)∗∇(ω0+ω)α + Sc

This implies

Since Sc is positive, we conclude h2
ω = dim(ker(d1 ◦d∗

■
Now, since h0
ω = 0 = h2
ω for the type of manifolds under consideration, the dimension
h1
ω coincides with (minus) the analytical index of the elliptic complex EYM given
by (6.5.3), with Ad(P) replaced by its complexiﬁcation. Thus, we may apply the
Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem 5.8.14, to calculate the dimension h1
ω.
Lemma 6.5.5 The topological index of the elliptic complex EYM is given by
ind(EYM) = −2p1(Ad(P)) + 1
2 dim G(χ(M) −σ(M)) ,
(6.5.7)
where p1(Ad(P)) is the Pontryagin index of Ad(P) and χ(M) and σ(M) are, respec-
tively, the Euler number and the signature of M.
Proof Our proof is along the lines of [246]. According to (5.7.42) and (5.7.44), it
sufﬁces to compute the index of the assembled complex

that the principal symbols of d0 + d∗

ind(E) = ind(E−
e ) .
Let EdR(M, Ad(P)C) and Esgn(M, Ad(P)C) denote the de Rham complex and the
signature complex, respectively,27 twisted with Ad(P)C. Using
ind(E−

Now, the idea will be to write down a local model Cω for the moduli space in the
neighbourhood of a chosen irreducible self-dual connection ω and to prove that it
yields local coordinates on the global moduli space (endowed with the appropriate

in the neighbourhood of [ω], cf. (6.5.1). Here, C + is the space of all irreducible self-
dual connections on P. Finally, an atlas on M is constructed using local charts of
this type. From Lemma 6.5.1 we know that H1
ω = ker(d1)/ im(d0) is a candidate for
T[ω]M. Since im(d0) is generated by local gauge transformations, as a local model
near ω we can take ker(d1) and intersect it with a local slice ﬁxing the gauge. An
appropriate choice is d∗
ωτ = 0. Thus, we consider the following subset of T :

.
(6.5.10)
Now, up to some analytical technicalities,28 we will prove the following fundamental
theorem.
Theorem 6.5.6 (Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer) Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle with
a compact and semi-simple structure group G over a 4-dimensional self-dual com-
pact Riemannian manifold with positive scalar curvature. Then, the moduli space of
irreducible self-dual connections on P is either empty29 or a manifold of dimension
dim M = 2p1(Ad(P)) −1
2 dim G(χ(M) −σ(M)) .
(6.5.11)
Proof Let ω be an irreducible self-dual connection on P. In the ﬁrst step, we prove
that Cω is an h1
ω-dimensional manifold with tangent space H1
ω. For that purpose, let
Gp be the Green's operators and let Hp be the orthogonal projectors onto the harmonic
subspaces H p
ω of the elliptic complex EYM. Then,
Hp + Gp ◦□p = id ,
p = 1, 2, 3 ,
with the Hodge-Laplace operators given by (6.5.5). Recall that the Green's operators
commute with d0 and d1 as well as with their adjoints. By Lemmas 6.5.3 and 6.5.4,
we have h0
ω = 0 = h2
ω and, thus, H0 = 0 = H2. Consider the following mapping
Φ : Ω1(M, Ad(P)) →Ω1(M, Ad(P)) ,
Φ(τ) := τ + 1
2G1 ◦d∗
1 (p−([τ, τ])) .
Denoting α = 1

1α
= d1τ + G2 ◦d1 ◦d∗
1α
= d1τ + G2 ◦□2α
= d1τ + (id −H2)(α)
28For a detailed presentation of the Sobolev-type arguments involved, we refer to Part IV in [83].

Clearly, the differential of Φ at τ = 0 is the identity. Thus, after an appropriate
Sobolev completion of Ω1(M, Ad(P)) as discussed in Sect.6.1, we may extend Φ to
this completion and we may apply the Inverse Function Theorem for Banach space
mappings to conclude that Φ is invertible on C∞-sections and that Φ−1 yields local
coordinates on Cω.
In the next step, we show that a neighbourhood of the origin in Cω contains, up to
local gauge transformations, all self-dual connections which are sufﬁciently close to
ω, that is, such a neighbourhood yields a local model of the moduli space.30 More
precisely, we will prove that there exists a neighbourhood U of 0 in Ω1(M, Ad(P))
and a neighbourhood W of 0 in Ω0(M, Ad(P)) such that for any τ ∈U, there exists
a unique X ∈W fulﬁlling
d∗

(ω + τ)(exp X) −ω

(6.5.12)
By (6.1.2), we have
(ω + τ)(exp X) −ω = d0X + τ + r(X, τ) ,
where r(tX, tτ) = t2r(X, τ, t) and r(X, τ, t) is locally deﬁned and smooth. Thus,
d∗

(ω + τ)(exp X) −ω

(ω + τ)(exp X) −ω

We conclude that (6.5.12) is fulﬁlled iff
X + G0 ◦d∗
0τ + G0 ◦d∗
0r(X, τ) = 0 .
(6.5.13)
Now, we choose neighbourhoods U1 ⊂Ω1(M, Ad(P)) and W1 ⊂Ω0(M, Ad(P))
of the origin and consider the mapping
Ψ : U1 × W1 →Ω0(M, Ad(P)) ,
Ψ (τ, X) := X + G0 ◦d∗
0τ + G0 ◦d∗
0r(X, τ) .
30This will follow from H0 = 0, that is, in particular, the assumption that ω be irreducible is essential
here.

The Yang-Mills Equation
Again, bystandardSobolev-typearguments, Ψ maybeextendedtoasuitableSobolev
completion and the Implicit Function Theorem for Banach spaces may be applied
yielding that, for sufﬁciently small U and W, for any τ ∈U there exists a unique
X(τ) ∈W such that (6.5.12) holds. From elliptic regularity, one then concludes that
X(τ) is C∞if τ is C∞. In particular, if ω + τ is self-dual and sufﬁciently close to ω,
then there exists a gauge transformation u = exp X such that (ω + τ)(u) belongs to
ω + Cω. Moreover, by the uniquess of X(τ), no two self-dual connections in ω + Cω
sufﬁciently close to ω can be equivalent under a small gauge transformation.
Finally, we must endow the global moduli space M = C +/G with a manifold
structure. By standard arguments, M is a topological Hausdorff space. We show that,
in a neighbourhood of any [ω] ∈M, the local model Cω yields a local chart, that
is, for a sufﬁciently small neighbourhood U ⊂ω + Cω of the origin, the natural
projection to M is injective. For that purpose, let ω + τ, with τ ∈U, be another
self-dual connection and assume that it is gauge equivalent to ω under an (arbitrarily
large) gauge transformation u ∈G . Viewing the latter as a section of End(Ad(P)),
by (6.1.8),
u−1dωu = τ .
(6.5.14)
Now, take the component h0 ⊂End(g) consisting of the endomorphisms invariant
under the natural action31 of G and decompose End(g) = h0 ⊕h1, where h1 is
the orthogonal complement with respect to the scalar product induced from the
Ad-invariant scalar product on g. Take the corresponding orthogonal direct sum
decomposition End(Ad(P)) = E0 ⊕E1. It is easy to show (Exercise 6.5.1) that the
irreducibility of ω implies
ker

dω : Γ ∞(E1) →Ω1(M, E1)

= 0 .
(6.5.15)
Thus, the smallest eigenvalue λ of the positive self-adjoint elliptic operator
□ω = d∗
ωdω : Γ ∞(E1) →Γ ∞(E1)
is positive and, for any u1 ∈Γ ∞(E1), we obtain:
∥dωu1 ∥2= ⟨□ωu1, u1⟩≥λ ∥u1 ∥2 .
Inserting the decomposition u = u0 + u1 with respect to the above orthogonal
splitting of End(Ad(P)) into (6.5.14) and using that u, as a section of End(Ad(P)),
is isometric, we obtain
∥τ ∥2=∥dωu ∥2≥∥dωu1 ∥2≥λ ∥u1 ∥2 .
31The adjoint representation induces a natural representation T = Ad ⊗Ad∗: G →Aut(End(g))
via T(g)(η) := Ad(g) ◦η ◦Ad(g−1).

6.5 The Instanton Moduli Space
517
Up to some further analytical arguments, this shows that, for small enough τ, the
gauge transformation u = u0+u1 will be (uniformly) arbitrarily close to the subspace
Γ ∞(E0). Hence, by deﬁnition of E0, u will be close to a constant mapping with values
in the centre of G, the latter belonging to the centralizer of ω.
It remains to show that the transition mappings are smooth. For this purely tech-
nical exercise we refer to [83]. Finally, the dimension formula (6.5.11) follows from
Lemma 6.5.5.
■
Example 6.5.7 For M = S4, we have χ(M) = 2 and σ(M) = 0 (Exercise 6.5.3).
Then, (6.5.11) reduces to
dim M = 2p1(Ad(P)) −dim G .
By (4.3.21), for G = SU(2) ∼= Sp(1), we have
p1(Ad(P)) = −4c2(P) = 4k(P) .
Thus, we obtain
dim M = 8k(P) −3 ,
(6.5.16)
cf. formula (6.4.24). This number has been found earlier by Schwarz [568] and
Jackiw and Rebbi [343]. It can be easily seen that, using an orientation-reversing
diffeomorphism of S4, one obtains the same statement for k(P) < 0, with k(P)
replaced by −k(P). For a detailed analysis of all the classical groups in this context,
we refer to [37].
♦
Next, we study the moduli space of Sp(1)-instantons on S4 with instanton number
k(P) = ±1 in some detail. As already mentioned in Sect.6.3, it coincides with the
homogeneous space SL(2, H)/Sp(2). Here, we give the proof of this fact. It is enough
to consider one case, say k(P) = −1, the other one being obtained by an orientation-
reversing diffeomorphism of S4. As a ﬁrst check, comparing with formula (6.5.16),
we have dim(SL(2, H)/Sp(2)) = 5 = 8|k(P)| −3, indeed.
Lemma 6.5.8 1. Within the isomorphism class of principal Sp(1)-bundles over S4
deﬁned by the instanton number k(P) = −1, the quaternionic Hopf bundle P−is the
unique element admitting a lift of Sp(2) to automorphisms.
2. The canonical connection ω−is the unique Sp(2)-invariant connection on P−.
Proof 1. Denote K = Sp(2), H = Sp(1) × Sp(1) and G = Sp(1). By Remark
1.9.7/1, since K acts transitively on K/H ∼= S4, principal G-bundles over K/H
admitting a lift of K are labeled by Lie group homomorphisms λ : H →G and have
the structure
Pλ = K ×H G .

518
6
The Yang-Mills Equation
We claim that λ is surjective. Assume, on the contrary, that it is not. Then, by Corol-
lary 5.3.7 and Proposition 5.1.7 in Part I, the induced Lie algebra homomorphism
dλ : sp(1) ⊕sp(1) →sp(1) is not surjective. As a consequence, im(dλ) is either
trivial or a u(1)-subalgebra of sp(1). Since Sp(1) × Sp(1) is connected, im(λ) is
trivial or a U(1)-subgroup of Sp(1). Now, clearly, Pλ admits a reduction Q to the
subgroup im(λ). In case im(λ) trivial, Q provides a global section of P. In case im(λ)
a U(1)-subgroup, Theorem 4.8.1 and H2
Z(S4) = 0 imply that Q is trivial. In either
case, we conclude that P is trivial, which is a contradiction. Thus, λ must be surjec-
tive. But the only surjective homomorphisms from H to G are given by projection
onto the ﬁrst or second component of H, respectively. Now, the condition k(P) = −1
selects the projection onto the ﬁrst component. By Remark 6.3.1/2, Pλ is isomorphic
to P−.
2. Denote the Lie algebras of K, H and G by k, h and g, respectively, and consider
the reductive decomposition
k = h ⊕m .
By point 1, we may identify P−with K ×H G. By Remark 1.9.12/4, the K-invariant
connections on K ×H G are classiﬁed by H-equivariant mappings ˜Φ : m →g, that
is,
˜Φ ◦Ad(h) = Ad(λ(h)) ◦˜Φ ,
h ∈H .
As noted in this Remark, ˜Φ may be viewed as an operator intertwining the repre-
sentations Ad(H)↾m and Ad(λ(H)). Now, decomposing these representations into
irreducible components and using Schur's Lemma, one may construct all solutions
˜Φ explicitly. Here, the only solution is ˜Φ = 0, because Ad(H)↾m coincides with the
vector representation of SO(4) and Ad(λ(H)) is the adjoint representation of G. We
conclude that on the above bundle we have a unique K-invariant connection form
˜ω. It is given by formula (1.9.41), with ˜Φ = 0. In the terminology introduced in
Remark 1.9.14/2, ˜ω coincides with the canonical connection on K ×H G. Note that
in the present case one may choose representatives in such a way that this formula
reduces to
˜ωp(Z) = (pr1)′(Ah) .
Now, it is easy to check that ˜ω coincides with the pullback of ω−under the isomor-
phism P−→Sp(2)/λ+(Sp(1) × Sp(1)) given in Remark 6.3.1/2 (Exercise 6.5.4).
■
Theorem 6.5.9 (Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer) The moduli space M−1 of anti-self-dual
connections on P−with instanton number −1 is diffeomorphic to SL(2, H)/Sp(2).
Proof Consider the action ˜Ψ of the conformal covering group ˜C0(S4) = SL(2, H)
on P−given by Proposition 6.3.7. By Proposition 6.2.7, ˜C0(S4) acts on the space
of (anti-)self-dual connections and thus, by Remark 6.2.8, it acts on M−1. We must
prove that this action is transitive with stabilizer Sp(2).
Let [ω] ∈M−1 and let K ⊂SL(2, H) be its stabilizer. Since dim SL(2, H) = 15
and, by (6.5.16), dim M−1 = 5, we have dim K ≥10. Let ω ∈[ω] be a K-invariant
representative. Since ω is anti-self-dual, by (6.2.10),

6.5 The Instanton Moduli Space
519
−p1(Ad(P)) =
1
8π2 ∥Ωω ∥2 vg0 .
Thus, ∥Ωω ∥is a non-negative function, which is K-invariant and non-vanishing on
a K-invariant open subset U ⊂S4. This, in turn, deﬁnes a K-invariant Riemannian
metric g on U via
g =∥Ωω ∥g0
belonging to the conformal class of the standard metric g0. By construction, K acts
on the Riemannian manifold (U, g) by isometries. Now, by Theorem 2.2.18, the
isometry group of an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold has dimension at most
1
2n(n + 1) and if the dimension is maximal, then the manifold is a space of constant
curvature. This implies dim K ≤10. We conclude that dim K = 10 and that g must
be a metric of constant curvature. Since ∥Ωω ∥is ﬁnite, Theorem 1 in Note 10
of [383]/Part I implies that g must be a metric of positive constant curvature on S4
isometric to g0. That is, there exists an isometry c ∈C0(S4) such that
Ψ ∗
c g = g0 .
The transformation Ψc lifts to a transformation ˜Ψ˜c , ˜c ∈SL(2, H) , of P−and we
have ˜c −1K˜c = Sp(2), because g0 is Sp(2)-invariant. Thus, ˜Ψ ∗
˜c ω is Sp(2)-invariant
and, by Lemma 6.5.8, it must coincide with the unique Sp(2)-invariant connection
ω−on P−,
˜Ψ ∗
˜c ω = ω−.
This shows that SL(2, H) acts transitively on M−1 with stabilizer Sp(2).
■
The second part of the above proof is along the lines of [357]. It differs completely
from the original proof in [37]. There, a vanishing argument based on the Weitzen-
boeck formula for the Dirac operator was used. However, the idea to use the theory
of invariant connections was already mentioned in [37].
Remark 6.5.10
1. By Example 5.2.11,32
SL(2, H)/{±1} ∼= SO+(1, 5) ,
Sp(2)/{±1} ∼= SO(5) .
(6.5.17)
Thus, C0(S4) may be identiﬁed with SO+(1, 5) and
M−1 ∼= SL(2, H)/Sp(2) = SO+(1, 5)/SO(5) .
Recall from point 5 of Example 2.5.27 that the latter homogeneous space is
symmetric and may be identiﬁed with the 5-dimensional hyperbolic hypersurface
H+(1, 5) in (R6, η).
32Recall that Spinr,s = Spins,r, that is, we could also take SO+(5, 1) below.

The Yang-Mills Equation
Here, η is the pseudo-Euclidean metric in 6 dimensions, with the signature con-
vention (−, + . . . , +). Now, given the parameterization (6.3.21) and viewing x0
as an element z0 ∈S4 ⊂R5 via the stereographic projection mapping ϕs, the
mapping
(0, 1) × S4 →
◦
D5 \ {0} ,
(λ, z0) 
→(1 −λ)z0
yields a diffeomorphism of M−1 onto the punctured open ball in R5.33 The BPST
anti-instanton is obtained by taking the limit λ →1, that is, it sits in the centre.
For each pair (λ, z0), in the limit λ →0, one approaches z0 ∈S4, that is, the
original manifold S4 may be viewed as the boundary of the open ball thus yielding
its compactiﬁcation. Note that in this limit, the curvature becomes more and more
concentrated at z0. Also note that we have a collar
[0, λ0) × S4 =
	
(1 −λ)z0 ∈
◦
D5 : λ < λ0

∪S4 ,
λ0 < 1 .
We will see below that this characterization of the moduli space near its boundary
generalizes to any compact, simply connected and oriented 4-manifold satisfying
a certain topological condition.
2. In a series of papers [277], [262], [156], [432], the Riemannian metric of the
moduli spaces M±1 (inherited from the L2-metric on the space of connections)
has been studied. It was shown that this metric is conformally ﬂat, rotationally
invariant and incomplete. The volume deﬁned by this metric is ﬁnite.
3. From the proof of Theorem 6.5.9, it should be clear that there is a deep relation
between (anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills connections on S4 and the (anti-)self-dual
parts of the Levi-Civita connection of the standard metric on S4. Indeed, by
Example 1.1.18, the bundle of oriented orthonormal frames O+(S4) coincides
with SO(5) viewed as a principal SO(4)-bundle over S4 and, by Proposition
2.5.10 and Remark 2.5.28, the Levi-Civita connection of the standard Riemannian
metric on S4 coincides with the SO(5)-invariant connection on this bundle. By
Example 5.4.9, the (unique) spin bundle S(S4) coincides with Sp(2) viewed as
a principal (Sp(1) × Sp(1))-bundle over S4. Thus, the spin connection on S(S4)
coincides with the Sp(2)-invariant connection ω0 on Sp(2) deﬁned by (6.3.7).
Now, consider the decomposition
2TS4 = 2
+TS4 ⊕2
−TS4
into self-dual and anti-self-dual elements corresponding to the eigenvalues ±1
of the Hodge star operator of g0, cf. (2.8.8). By the discussion in Sect.2.8, this
is an SO(4)-invariant splitting corresponding to the Lie algebra decomposition
33Clearly, this is the Poincaré model of the hyperbolic 5-space.

6.5 The Instanton Moduli Space
521
so(4) = so(3) ⊕so(3). It induces principal bundle morphisms34 O+(S4) →
O(2
±TS4) onto the principal SO(3)-bundles of (positive and negative) ortho-
normal frames of 2
+TS4 and 2
−TS4, respectively. Clearly, the unique lifts of
O(2
±TS4) to the Sp(1)-principal spin bundles S(2
±TS4) coincide with the
bundles P± deﬁned by (6.3.2), cf. also Example 5.4.11. Thus, the induced
(anti-)self-dual connections ω± on P± deﬁned by (6.3.8) coincide with the
S(2
±TS4)-components of the spin connection on S4.
This relation generalizes as follows, see Proposition 2.2 in [37]: for any 4-
dimensional manifold endowed with an Einstein metric,35 the induced connec-
tions on the bundles O(2
±TS4) and S(2
±TS4) are (anti-)self-dual. Conversely,
if the induced connections on O(2
+TS4) and S(2
+TS4) are self-dual, then the
metric is Einstein.
♦
We close this section by discussing how reducible self-dual connections modify the
above picture, leading to a full understanding of the structure of the moduli space M
of self-dual SU(2)-connection of instanton number 1 over four-manifolds fulﬁlling
conditions to be described below. Some points are beyond the scope of this book, so
that we must refer to the original work of Donaldson [157] and to the textbooks of
Freed and Uhlenbeck [213], Lawson [406] and Donaldson and Kronheimer [159].
By Theorem 6.1.5, the stabilizer of a connection is given by the centralizer of
its holonomy group in the structure group. For reducible connections, the holonomy
group is a proper subgroup of the structure group and, thus, in this case we obtain
nontrivial stabilizers leading to a nontrivial stratiﬁed structure of the full gauge orbit
space. In this picture, the reducible connections correspond to the singular strata. The
resulting stratiﬁcation will be discussed in detail in Chap.8. Here, we are interested
in reducible SU(2)-connections which are self-dual. In that case, by the Ambrose-
Singer Theorem 1.7.15, discrete subgroups give a vanishing curvature and may there-
fore be excluded. The only proper subgroups giving a non-vanishing curvature are
copies of U(1). Any U(1)-subgroup is conjugate to the standard embedding

(6.5.18)
Next, we make the following assumptions on M.
(a) M is simply connected.
(b) The intersection form36 sM of M is positive deﬁnite.
Note that we do not assume that M be self-dual. Thus, in general, H2
ω ̸= 0, cf. the
proof of Lemma 6.5.4. Now, let ω be a reducible connection on P(M, G) and let Ω
34These morphisms are induced from the group homomorphism SO(4) →SO(4)/Z2 = SO(3) ×
SO(3) combined with the canonical projections onto the ﬁrst and the second SO(3)-component,
respectively.

The Yang-Mills Equation
be its curvature. Then, the restriction of Ω to a holonomy bundle P(ω) is a 2-form
with values in the Lie algebra iR of U(1) and, thus, it is given by a 2-form iF on M.
By Theorem 4.6.11, the corresponding de Rham cohomology class
[−(2π)−1F] ∈H2
dR(M)
coincides with the ﬁrst Chern class c1(P(ω)). Moreover, by the Bianchi identity,
we have dF = 0. Now, let us assume that ω is self-dual with instanton number
k(P) = 1. Then,
d∗F = ∗◦d ◦∗F = ∗dF = 0 ,
that is, F is harmonic. Conversely, if F is harmonic, then using (5.7.56) we have
∥F−∥2 = −sM(F−, F−)
and, therefore, assumption (b) implies F−= 0 showing that ω is self-dual. Moreover,
sM(F, F) =

Thus, c1(P(ω)) = [−(2π)−1F] fulﬁls
sM(c1(P(ω)), c1(P(ω))) = 1 .
(6.5.19)
It is also easily seen (Exercise 6.5.5) that F is the same for any element of the
gauge-equivalence class deﬁned by ω. Note, however, that F is not invariant under
conjugation with elements of the form

 0

e−iϕ 0

Under such a transformation, elements of H given by (6.5.18), are transformed into
their inverses. On the level of the Lie algebra iR, this means that elements are sent
to their negatives. Thus, in particular, F is sent to −F. To summarize, we have
constructed a mapping between gauge-equivalence classes [ω] of reducible self-dual
connections on P and pairs (u, −u) with u ∈H2
Z(M) fulﬁlling sM(u, u) = 1.
Proposition 6.5.11 The assignment [ω] →±c1(P(ω)) is bijective.
Proof Since, by assumption (a), we have H1
dR(M) = 0, injectivity is an immediate
consequence of Proposition 4.8.1. For the proof of surjectivity, let u ∈H2

6.5 The Instanton Moduli Space

fulﬁlling sM(u, u) = 1. We construct a reducible self-dual connection ω such that
c1(P(ω)) = ±u as follows. Let L be a line bundle with c1(L) = u and let L be its
conjugate bundle. Then, endowing L with a Hermitean ﬁbre metric, E := L ⊕L
becomes a Hermitean vector bundle. Let O(E) be the associated principal U(2)-
bundle of unitary frames. Clearly, O(E) reduces to a principal SU(2)-bundle Q.
Using sM(u, u) = 1, we ﬁnd
c2(L ⊕L) = c1(L) ∪c1(L) = u ∪(−u) = −1 ,
and, thus, Q is isomorphic to P according to Theorem 4.8.8. Let ˆQ ⊂Q be the sub-
bundle of unitary frames of L ⊂E. Then, for any connection ˆω on ˆQ, the associated
1-form F of its curvature fulﬁls [−(2π)−1F] = u. Now, by Hodge theory, there
exists a 1-form α on M such that F + dα is harmonic.37 As already stated above,
by assumption (b), to this harmonic 2-form there corresponds a self-dual reducible
connection on P.
■
Let2ν(M)bethenumberofelementsu ∈H2
Z(M)fulﬁllingsM(u, u) = 1.Then,under
the assumptions of the above proposition, the moduli space M contains exactly ν(M)
reducible connections. The structure of the singularities caused by these points have
been analyzed in detail, see e.g. Sect.4 of [213]. The starting point is the following.
In the case under consideration, the stabilizer Gω of a reducible self-dual connection
ω is isomorphic to S1 and its Lie algebra is the 1-dimensional kernel of
dω : Ω0(M, Ad(P)) →Ω1(M, Ad(P)) .
The latter represents the 0-th cohomology of the elliptic complex (6.5.3). Clearly,
Gω acts on the cohomology groups of this complex, and the complex is equivariant
under this action. Now, as in the proof of Theorem 6.5.6, one can construct local
slices of the form (6.5.10), the only difference being that one must factorize with
respect to the S1-action. Moreover, as already mentioned, in general we now have
H2
ω ̸= 0. By ellipticity of the complex, the mapping d1 = p−◦d1
ω restricted to a slice
deﬁned by d∗
ωα = 0, α ∈Ω1(M, Ad(P)), is Fredholm. This is the basic fact which
makes it possible to calculate the ﬁrst and the second cohomology of the complex,
together with the action of S1, explicitly. One obtains [213]
H1
ω ∼= Cq ,
H2
ω ∼= Cp ⊕p−(H2
dR(M)) ,
(6.5.20)
for some integers p and q. Here, Cq and Cp are endowed with the standard S1-action.
On p−(H2
dR(M)), S1 acts trivially. Moreover, if
p−(H2
dR(M)) = 0 ,
(6.5.21)
then p + q = 3, the latter following from the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem.
37Clearly, we have [F + dα] = u.

524
6
The Yang-Mills Equation
Remark 6.5.12 Recall that the signature of sM is denoted by (b+, b−). Since
sM(α, α) = ∥α+∥2 −∥α−∥2 ,
p−(H2
dR(M)) is the maximal subspace where sM is negative deﬁnite. Thus, the con-
dition (6.5.21) is equivalent to b−= 0, that is, it is equivalent to the condition that
sM be positive deﬁnite.
♦
We conclude that if H2
ω = 0, there exists a small neighbourhood of ω homeomorphic
to C3/U(1). The latter may be identiﬁed with a cone on CP2.
For H2
ω ̸= 0, the situation is much more complicated. In this context, the idea of
perturbing the metric of the base manifold M plays a crucial role. One can prove the
following [213].
(a) The set of Ck-metrics on M for which the irreducible connections in M form a
smooth manifold is open and dense.
(b) For an open and dense set of Ck-metrics, H2
ω vanishes at each singular point in
M.
Remark 6.5.13 By point (b), we see that the above local description of the singular
points in terms of cones on CP2 holds true in the generic case. Moreover, we obtain
a generalization of the dimension formula (6.5.11) of Atiyah, Hitchin and Singer to
the case of arbitrary compact 4-manifolds (for an open and dense set of metrics), cf.
the proof of Theorem 6.5.6 where, originally, Lemma 6.5.4 and, thus, the self-duality
of M was used.
♦
Next, one shows that the manifold ˆM ⊂M of irreducible connections is orientable.
Finally, using deep analytic results of Taubes [613] on the existence of self-dual
connections for the class of manifolds of the above type, one can prove that there
exists a collar (0, 1]×M ⊂M and that M∪M is a compact manifold with boundary.
To summarize, one has the following fundamental theorem.
Theorem 6.5.14 (Donaldson) Let P be a principal SU(2)-bundle with instanton
number k(P) = 1 over a compact, simply connected, oriented smooth 4-manifold
with positive deﬁnite intersection form. Then, the moduli space M has the following

1. Let 2ν(M) be the number of solutions to the equation sM(u, u) = 1. Then, for
almost all metrics on M, there exist ν points p1, . . . , pν(M) in M such that M \
{p1, . . . , pν(M)} is a smooth 5-dimensional oriented manifold. The points pi are in
one-to-one correspondence with gauge equivalence classes of reducible self-dual
connections.
2. Each point pi admits a neighbourhood of M which is homeomorphic to a cone
on CP2.
3. There exists a collar (0, 1] × M ⊂M and the space M = M ∪M is a compact

The Yang-Mills Equation
6.6
Instantons and Smooth 4-Manifolds
In this section, we show that the results of the previous section have deep implications
on the theory of differentiable structures on compact simply connected 4-manifolds.
We start with recalling some basic topological results without giving proofs. By a
fundamentaltheoremofWhitehead[665],twocompactsimplyconnectedtopological
4-manifoldsarehomotopyequivalentifftheirintersectionformsareequivalent.Thus,
let M be a compact simply connected 4-manifold. Then, w1(M) = 0 and hence M
is orientable. Let us ﬁx an orientation. If M is not smooth, then the deﬁnition of
the intersection form sM given by (5.7.56) has to be generalized as follows. For
u, v ∈H2
Z(M), we deﬁne
sM(u, v) := (u ∪v)[M] ,
(6.6.1)
where ∪: H2
Z(M) ⊗H2
Z(M) →H4
Z(M) is the cup-product and [M] ∈H4(M) is the
fundamental class of M given by the orientation. Clearly, sM is a symmetric non-
degenerate bilinear form on H2
Z(M). As before, its signature is denoted by (b+, b−),
the difference σ(M) := b+ −b−is called the signature of M and the rank of H2
Z(M)
is denoted by b(M).
By Poincaré duality, the elements u and v of H2
Z(M) may be represented by
cycles μ and ν belonging to H2(M). Under this identiﬁcation, one assigns to each
intersection point of μ and ν an integer ±1 and sM is the sum of these multiplicities.
This interpretation explains the name of sM. It also shows that sM is unimodular,38
see [406] for further details.
Example 6.6.1
1. Let M = S4. We have H2(S4) = H2
Z(S4) = 0 and, thus, sM = 0.
2. Let M = S2 × S2. Then, H2(S2 × S2) is generated by u = S2 × {∗} and v =
{∗} × S2, where ∗denotes a chosen point of S2. Thus, the matrix of sM in the
basis {u, v} of H2(S2 × S2) is given by
σ1 =

0 1
1 0

.
3. Let M = CP2. Here, the second homology H2(CP2) has one generator. Thus,
the matrix of sM is given by the 1 × 1-matrix with entry 1, which in the present
context is usually denoted by ⟨1⟩.
♦
Deﬁnition 6.6.2 A unimodular symmetric bilinear form s over Z is called even
(or of type II) if s(u, u) ∈2Z for all u ∈H2
Z(M). Otherwise, it is called odd
(or of type I).
Equivalently, viewing s as a matrix, it is even if all its diagonal entries are even and
odd otherwise.
38If sM is expressed as a matrix with integer entries, then det(sM) = ±1.

6.6 Instantons and Smooth 4-Manifolds

The following facts may be found in [450]. Indeﬁnite unimodular symmetric
bilinear forms s are classiﬁed by their rank and signature.
(a) For type I, they are given by
s = ⟨1⟩⊕. . . ⊕⟨1⟩⊕⟨−1⟩⊕. . . ⊕⟨−1⟩,
where ⟨1⟩and ⟨−1⟩denote the two possible 1-forms of rank 1.
(b) For type II, they are given by
s = σ1 ⊕. . . ⊕σ1 ⊕E8 ⊕. . . ⊕E8 ,
where

The classiﬁcation of deﬁnite unimodular symmetric bilinear forms over Z is a much
more involved task. In Table2.5 of the book of Lawson [406], the reader can ﬁnd a
list showing that the number of such forms drastically increases with their rank, e.g.
for rank 40, there are more than 1051 such forms.
Now, by the result of Whitehead cited above, the following questions naturally
arise:
(a) Which unimodular symmetric bilinear forms can appear as intersection forms
of a compact simply connected 4-manifold?
(b) How many inequivalent manifolds carry the same form?
For topological manifolds, these questions have been answered by Freedman [214]
in 1982. The Freedman Theorem states that every unimodular symmetric bilinear
form over Z is the intersection form of a compact simply connected topological 4-
manifold. Given such a form s, in the type II case, this manifold is unique, whereas
in the type I case there are exactly two distinct manifolds corresponding to s.
Now, let us consider differentiable 4-manifolds. Apart from the classical Rohlin
Theorem 5.9.7 stating that, for a compact simply connected39 4-manifold with inter-
section form of type II the signature σ(M) is divisible by 16, up until 1982 not much
was known. At this point, the work of Donaldson presented in the previous section
39If M is simply connected, vanishing of the second Stiefel-Whitney class is equivalent to the
signature being of type II.

The Yang-Mills Equation
led to a breakthrough. We will show that Theorem 6.5.14 almost immediately implies
the following.40
Theorem 6.6.3 (Donaldson) Let M be a compact simply connected41 oriented dif-
ferentiable 4-manifold whose intersection form sM is positive deﬁnite. Then,
sM = ⟨1⟩⊕. . . ⊕⟨1⟩.
(6.6.2)
Proof By Theorem 6.5.14 and standard cobordism theory, there exists a compact
oriented 5-manifold M0 ⊂M with boundary
∂M0 = M + p CP2 + q CP2 ,
p + q = ν(M) ,
where CP2 denotes CP2 with the opposite orientation. This manifold is obtained
by removing, say M × ( 1
2, 1), from the collar and by removing neighbourhoods
from each of the cone points. Since the signature σ(M) is a cobordism invariant, we
conclude σ(M) = q −p. Since the intersection form is positive deﬁnite, we have
σ(M) = b(M). Thus,
b(M) = σ(M) = q −p ≤q + p = ν(M) .
(6.6.3)
On the other hand, for any element u ∈H2
Z(M) fulﬁlling sM(u, u) = 1, we may take
the orthogonal decomposition
H2
Z(M) = Zu ⊕H2
Z(M)⊥,
given by writing
w = sM(w, u)u + (w −sM(w, u)u) ,
for any w ∈H2
Z(M). Thus, for another element v ∈H2
Z(M) fulﬁlling sM(v, v) = 1
and such that v ̸= ±u, the Schwartz inequality implies (sm(u, v))2 < 1 and thus
sM(u, v) = 0 ,
because sM(u, v) is an integer. This implies v ∈H2
Z(M)⊥. By this procedure, we
may exhaust the rank b(M) of H2
Z(M) iff sM is diagonalizable over the integers.
Consequently, we have
ν(M) ≤b(M)
40The only additional input we need is elementary knowledge of cobordism theory. For our purposes,
the information contained in Appendix B of [213] is sufﬁcient. For a more detailed presentation,
see e.g. [104], Sect.16 of Chap. II.
41We present the theorem in its original formulation. The assumption of being simply connected
may be dropped, see also the Remark after Theorem 6.5.14.

6.6 Instantons and Smooth 4-Manifolds
529
and ν(M) = b(M) iff sM has the form given by (6.6.2). Combining this with (6.6.3)
yields the assertion.
■
By this theorem, the answer to the questions (a) and (b) posed above is drastically
simpliﬁed. All forms differing from (6.6.2) are ruled out. Combining this with the
above mentioned result of Freedman and Example 6.6.1, we obtain the following.
Corollary 6.6.4 Let M be a smooth compact simply-connected oriented 4-manifold.
If sM is positive deﬁnite and even, then M is homeomorphic to S4. If sM is positive
deﬁnite and odd, then M is homeomorphic to a connected sum of positively oriented
copies of CP2.
■
In the following example we sketch a striking consequence of Donaldson theory:
the existence of exotic smooth structures on R4. For details we refer to [406] and
[253].
Example 6.6.5 (Exotic differentiable structure on R4) Let us consider the compact
simply connected topological 4-manifold M with intersection form
sM = E8 ⊕⟨1⟩.
Its existence is guaranteed by the Freedman Theorem. On the other hand, by the
Donaldson Theorem, it does not admit a smooth structure. The idea of the construc-
tion consists in considering M with a point p ∈M removed. By a result of Gompf
[253], this manifold is smoothable, that is, there exists a neighbourhood U of p in M
such that U \ {p} is diffeomorphic to V \ ϕ(S2), where V is a neighbourhood of the
image of S2 ∼= CP1 under a homeomorphism ϕ in CP2.42
Now, consider the embedding CP1 →CP2 , [(z1, z2)] 
→[(z1, z2, 0)] . Then,
CP2 \ CP1 →C2 ,
[(z1, z2, z3)] 
→(z1/z3, z2/z3)
is a homeomorphism. Thus, for any homeomorphism ϕ : CP2 →CP2, we have
CP2 \ ϕ(CP1) ∼= ϕ(CP2 \ CP1) ∼= C2 ∼= R4 ,
that is, CP2 \ ϕ(CP1) is homeomorphic to R4. But, ˜R4 = CP2 \ ϕ(CP1) cannot
be diffeomorphic to the ordinary R4. This follows from the fact that ˜R4 contains
a compact subset which cannot be enclosed by a smoothly embedded 3-sphere.43
Indeed, choose an open neighbourhood ˜U of ϕ(S2) and assume that the compact
subset K = ˜R4 \
 ˜U \ ϕ(S2)

can be enclosed by a smoothly embedded S3 ⊂
 ˜U \ ϕ(S2)

. Then, we could cut along S3 and attach a 4-disk. This would give a
42In such a situation, we say that p is resolvable. By a general theorem of Quinn [527], for any
compact topological 4-manifold M whose Kirby-Siebenmann invariant is zero, the following holds:
M has a smooth structure deﬁned outside a ﬁnite set of singular points such that each of these points
is resolvable. The manifold considered in the example fulﬁls the assumptions of this theorem.
43In the ordinary R4, any compact set can be enclosed by a smoothly embedded 3-sphere.

The Yang-Mills Equation
smoothing of M which, by the Donaldson Theorem, is impossible. For details of this
surgery we refer to [406], [213].
♦
For further examples and a lot of further references, we refer to the textbooks [574]
and [28]. Clearly, these exotic structures are only part of a huge ﬁeld of research
initiated by Donaldson. In particular, Donaldson has constructed a set of new differ-
ential topological invariants, now called Donaldson invariants, of 4-manifolds, see
[159], [574] and [28]. These invariants may be used to distinguish between the dif-
feomorphism types of certain 4-manifolds, e.g. they allowed for showing that there
exist compact 4-manifolds with inﬁnitely many non-equivalent smooth structures.
6.7
Stability
For the discussion of stability of solutions of the Yang-Mills equation we must ﬁnd
the second variational formula for the Yang-Mills functional (6.2.1) at a critical
point. Thus, let ω be a critical point. As in Sect.6.2, we consider t 
→ωt = ω + tα
with α ∈TωC = T and calculate the second variation by expanding S(ωt) up to
second order. Using
Ωt = Ω + tdωα + t2
2 [α, α] ,
(6.7.1)
we get
S(ωt) = S(ω) + t⟨Ω, dωα⟩L2 + t2
2 (⟨Ω, [α, α]⟩L2 + ⟨dωα, dωα⟩L2) ,
and thus
d2
dt2 ↾0
S(ωt) = ⟨[α, α], Ω⟩L2 + ⟨dωα, dωα⟩L2 .
By deﬁnition of the adjoint, the second term may be rewritten as
⟨dωα, dωα⟩L2 = ⟨α, d∗
ωdωα⟩L2 .
To calculate the ﬁrst term, we decompose α and Ω in a local coframe {ϑi} in T∗M
and use the Ad-invariance of the scalar product. Then, by (2.7.49),
[α, α]
.∧∗Ω = ηikηjl⟨[αi, αj], Ωkl⟩vg
= ηjl⟨αj, ηik[Ωkl, αi]⟩vg
= α

where

is the Weitzenboeck curvature operator for the case σ = Ad acting on 1-forms, cf.
Deﬁnition 2.7.10. Thus, the Hessian at ω of the Yang-Mills functional S is given by
Hω = d∗
ωdω + R∇ω .
(6.7.3)
This is the basic object for the study of stability. Clearly, by gauge invariance of the
Yang-Mills action, the variational problem we are dealing with may be viewed as
a problem on the gauge orbit space M . Thus, in a ﬁrst step we should get rid of
variations along the gauge orbits. This is done by using the decomposition (6.1.28),
with the ﬁrst component representing the subspace tangent to the orbit and the sec-
ond being a model of the tangent space to the gauge orbit space at [ω]. Thus, by
gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills functional, we may restrict the above variational
problem to the subspace of variations fulﬁlling
d∗
ωα = 0 .
If we do so, the Hessian (6.7.3) may be rewritten as
Hω = □ω + R∇ω .
(6.7.4)
This object may now be investigated using standard geometric methods. In this analy-
sis, the crucial role is played by the Generalized Weitzenboeck Formula (2.7.61).
Applying point 1 of Corollary 2.7.21 to the case E = Ad(P), we obtain
Hω(α) =

∇(ω0+ω)∗∇(ω0+ω)α + α ◦Ric + 2R∇ω(α) ,
(6.7.5)
for any α ∈Ω1(M, Ad(P)) fulﬁlling d∗
ωα = 0.
Deﬁnition 6.7.1 A Yang-Mills connection ω is said to be stable if
⟨α, Hω(α)⟩L2 > 0
for all nonzero α ∈ker d∗
ω ⊂Ω1(M, Ad(P)). It is said to be weakly stable if
⟨α, Hω(α)⟩L2 ≥0.
Remark 6.7.2 By the results of Chap.5, the operator Hω is elliptic and self-adjoint.
Morever, the Bochner-Laplace operator

∇(ω0+ω)∗∇(ω0+ω) is obviously non-
negative. Thus, the restriction of Hω to ker d∗
ω, has eigenvalues λ1 < λ2 < . . . such
that limn→∞λn →∞and the corresponding eigenspaces Eλi are ﬁnite-dimensional.
One deﬁnes the index i(ω) and the nullity n(ω) of ω by
i(ω) := dim (⊕λ<0Eλ) ,
n(ω) := dim E0 .
In this Morse theoretic terminology, a solution ω is stable iff i(ω) = n(ω) = 0.
Correspondingly, a solution is weakly stable iff i(ω) = 0.
♦

The Yang-Mills Equation
For the study of stability, we follow the classical paper of Bourguignon and Law-
son [95]. To start with, we need the following observations. First, recall the notion of
the gradient grad f = g−1(df ) of a function f ∈C∞(M). A vector ﬁeld X ∈X(M)
is said to be of gradient type if
d(g(X)) = 0 .
Clearly, this condition implies that, locally, there exists a function f such that X =
grad f , that is, g(X) = df . This explains the terminology.
Lemma 6.7.3 Let X ∈X(M) be of gradient type and let β ∈Ω2(M, Ad(P)) be
such that d∗
ωβ = 0. Then,
d∗
ω(X⌟β) = 0 .
Proof Setting β = ∗α in (2.7.9) and using (2.7.3), we obtain X⌟β = ∗(∗β ∧g(X)).
Now, using (2.7.13), (2.7.3), (1.5.9) and once again (2.7.9), we calculate
d∗
ω(X⌟β) = (−1)n ∗dω(∗β ∧g(X))
= (−1)n ∗

dω(∗β) ∧g(X) + (−1)(n−2)(∗β) ∧d(g(X))

= 0 .
■
Now, let us focus on the case M = Sn. We consider the following ﬁnite-dimensional
subspace of X(Sn):
V :=

grad f ∈X(Sn) : f = F↾Sn for some linear F : Rn+1 →R

.
(6.7.6)
Note that we have a natural isomorphism
Rn+1 →V ,
v 
→V (x) := v −⟨v, x⟩x ,
x ∈Sn .
(6.7.7)
It is easy to see (Exercise 6.7.1) that
V = grad f , where f (x) = ⟨v, x⟩.
(6.7.8)
Given a submanifold M ⊂Rk, the orthogonal projector P onto TM along the orthog-
onal complement of TM in Rk deﬁnes a connection ∇0 on M called the induced
Euclidean connection, cf. formula (6.4.13). It can be shown that ∇0 coincides with
the covariant derivative ∇ω0 of the Levi-Civita connection deﬁned by the natural
induced Riemannian metric on M. We apply this concept to the case of Sn ⊂Rn+1.
Lemma 6.7.4 Let ∇0 be the induced Euclidean connection on Sn. For any V ∈V ,
∇0
Y V = −fY ,
(∇0)∗∇0V = V ,
(6.7.9)
where Y ∈X(Sn).

For the study of stability, the following family of quadratic forms on V will be
crucial. For any β ∈Ω2(M, Ad(P)), we put
Qβ(V ) := ⟨iV β, Hω(iV β)⟩L2 .
(6.7.10)
Proposition 6.7.5 (Bourguignon-Lawson) Let P be a principal G-bundle over Sn
and let ω be a Yang-Mills connection. Let β ∈Ω2(M, Ad(P)) be harmonic, that is,
d∗
ωβ = 0 ,
dωβ = 0 .
Then, the trace of the quadratic form Qβ is given by
tr(Qβ) = 2(4 −n)∥β∥2 .
Proof For simplicity, in this proof we write ∇for ∇(ω0+ω) and ∇0 for ∇ω0.
By Lemma 6.7.3, we have d∗
ω(iV β) = 0 for any V ∈V . Thus, the Hessian acting
on iV β is given by formula (6.7.5),
Hω(iV β) = ∇∗∇(iV β) + iV β ◦Ric + 2R∇ω(iV β) .
(6.7.11)
First, we calculate Hω(iV β) at a point x ∈Sn. For that purpose, we choose an
orthonormal basis {ε0, . . . , εn} of V such that
(a) under the isomorphism (6.7.7), ε0, ε1, . . . , εn correspond to x, e1, . . . , en, where
e1, . . . , en form an orthonormal basis of TxSn. Then,
ε0(x) = 0 ,
ε1(x) = e1 ,
. . . ,
εn(x) = en .
(b) the vector ﬁelds ε1, . . . , εn are parallel at x,

2-form with an anti-symmetric one.

Note that harmonic elements of Ω2(M, Ad(P)) certainly exist, e.g. for β we can take
the curvature form of ω. Thus, as an immediate consequence of this proposition, we
obtain the following.44
Corollary 6.7.6 There are no weakly stable Yang-Mills connections on Sn for n ≥5.

Theorem 6.7.7 (Bourguignon-Lawson) Any weakly stable Yang-Mills connection
on S4 with gauge group SU(2), SU(3) or U(2) is either self-dual or anti-self-dual.
Proof Assume that ω is a weakly stable solution. Then, ⟨α, Hω(α)⟩L2 ≥0 for any
nonzero α ∈ker d∗
ω ⊂Ω1(M, Ad(P)). Thus,
Qβ(V ) = ⟨iV β, Hω(iV β)⟩L2 ≥0 ,
for any V ∈V and any β ∈Ω2(M, Ad(P)) fulﬁlling d∗
ωβ = 0. Now, by Proposition
(6.7.5), for n = 4 we have tr

= 0 and thus
Hω(iV β) = 0 ,
(6.7.14)
for any V ∈V and any harmonic β ∈Ω2(M, Ad(P)). Next, consider the curvature
form Ω of ω. Since ω is a Yang-Mills connection, Ω is harmonic and thus fulﬁls
(6.7.14). Let us decompose Ω into its self-dual and anti-self-dual components,
44The authors of [95] assign this result to J. Simons.

The Yang-Mills Equation
Ω = Ω+ + Ω−.
It is almost immediate (Exercise 6.7.2) that, on a compact oriented 4-manifold, a
vector-valued 2-form is harmonic iff its self-dual and anti-self-dual components are
both harmonic. Thus,
Hω(iV Ω±) = 0 .
Consequently, using (6.7.12), we obtain

i=1
[Ω+(ei, ·) + Ω−(ei, ·), Ω+(V, ei)] = 0 .
By linearity in V , we may substitute for V any of the frame elements εi and then
take arbitrary linear combinations of the resulting equations. This yields

(6.7.15)
for any X, Y ∈TxS4. Clearly, the left hand side of this equation is anti-symmetric
in X and Y. On the other hand, the right hand side is symmetric. This can be easily
checked by direct inspection using the bases {ϕi
±} of 2
±T∗M given under point 1
of Remark 2.8.1.45 Thus, both sides of (6.7.15) must vanish. Using this fact, again
by direct inspection using the bases {ϕi
±}, one ﬁnds (Exercise 6.7.3)
[Ω+(X, Y), Ω−(Z, W)] = 0 ,
X, Y, Z, W ∈TxS4 .
(6.7.16)
We conclude that the Lie subalgebras g±
x of g generated by the curvature transfor-
mations Ω±(X, Y), where X, Y ∈TxS4, commute,
[g+
x , g−
x ] = 0 .
Now, by direct inspection of the table giving the classiﬁcation of regular semisimple
Lie subalgebras of a semisimple Lie algebra,46 we see that if g = su(2), su(3) or
u(2), then either g+
x or g−
x must be Abelian. Therefore, one of the 4-tensors T ±,
deﬁned by
T ±(X, Y, Z, W) := [Ω±(X, Y), Ω±(Z, W)] ,
X, Y, Z, W ∈TxS4 ,

must vanish at x and, thus, also in a neighbourhood U ⊂S4 of x. Assume that T + = 0
on U. Then, by the Aronszajn Theorem [21], since T + is an algebraic function of a
solution of the elliptic equation □ωΩ+ = 0, it admits a unique continuation to the
whole of S4, that is, T + = 0 on S4. Then, (6.7.15) implies
∇∗∇Ω+ + 4Ω+ = 0 .
Since ∇∗∇≥0, we conclude Ω+ = 0. If T −vanishes, an analogous argument
yields Ω−= 0.

Remark 6.7.8
1. In [95], the reader can ﬁnd various extensions of Theorem 6.7.7. First, the case of
a real 4-dimensional Riemannian vector bundle E over a Riemannian 4-manifold
M with structure group G = SO(4) is dealt with in detail. In that case, there
are two independent characteristic invariants (the ﬁrst Pontryagin index and the
Euler number). This makes the analysis more delicate, but a similar result can
be proved, see Theorem 8.11 therein. In more detail, the splittings of 2TM and
2E induced by the Hodge star operator yield a two-fold decomposition of the
Riemannian curvature form and, consequently, the stability conditions are spelled
out in terms of what is called by the authors a two-fold self-duality. This notion
seems to be a reasonable generalization of (anti-)self-duality for the nonsimple
group SO(4). The simplest example of this type is the tangent bundle of S4.
Here, the ﬁrst Pontryagin index vanishes, the Euler number is equal to 2 and the
(two-fold self-dual, but not self-dual) Levi-Civita connection yields an absolute
minimum. Second, it is quite straightforward to generalize Theorem 6.7.7 to the
case of a 4-dimensional compact orientable homogeneous Riemannian manifold.
Then, for the gauge group SU(2), any weakly stable Yang-Mills connection
is either self-dual, or anti-self-dual, or reduces to an Abelian gauge ﬁeld, see
Theorem 10.1 in [95]. Similar results hold for U(2), SU(3) and SO(4), see [96].
2. We stress that [95] contains another interesting type of results. Using again
Weitzenboeck type arguments, Bourguignon and Lawson prove the existence of
C0-neighbourhoods of the minimal Yang-Mills connections which do not contain
any other solution.

The Yang-Mills Equation
6.8
Non-minimal Solutions
In view of the results of the previous section, it is natural to ask whether there exist
critical points of the Yang-Mills functional other than absolute or relative minima.
It is interesting to address this question, in particular, in the case of bundles over
S4 with structure groups SU(2), SU(3) and U(2). This problem is closely related
to the question whether there exist non-(anti-)self-dual solutions on 4-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds. In this section, we make some remarks on these problems. In
the study of non-minimal solutions, two ingredients play a basic role: ﬁrst, the theory
of invariant connections as developed in Sect.1.9 and, second, advanced methods
of the calculus of variations as developed by Taubes [613-616, 618]. The latter are
beyond the scope of this book.
We start with the following observation [339].
Proposition 6.8.1 (Itoh) Let M = K/H be a compact oriented Riemannian symmet-
ric space and let P be a principal G-bundle admitting a lift of K to automorphisms
of P. Then, the curvature of the canonical invariant connection47 on P is parallel
and, thus, the canonical invariant connection provides a Yang-Mills connection.
Proof By Remark 1.9.7/1, principal G-bundles over K/H admitting a lift of K are
labeled by Lie group homomorphisms λ : H →G and have the structure
Pλ = K ×H G .
We denote the lift of the K-action on K/H to Pλ by Δ. Let ωc be the canonical
connection on Pλ, cf. Eq. (1.9.43), and let Ωc be its curvature form. We will prove
that
∇(ωo+ωc)Ωc = 0 .
Then, the assertion will follow from (2.7.58).
Let k and h be the Lie algebras of K and H, respectively, and let k = h ⊕m be
the canonical decomposition deﬁned by the symmetric space structure of M. For any
A ∈m, let ϕA
t = exp(tA) and let ΦA
t denote the ﬂow of the Killing vector ﬁeld A∗on
Pλ generated by A via the K-action. This means
ΦA
t (p) = Δexp(tA)(p) ,
(A∗)p = Δ′
p(A) ,
for any p ∈Pλ. Fix a point p0 ∈Pλ in the ﬁbre over [1K] ∈M. Then, by (1.9.43),
the integral curve ΦA
t (p0) through p0 is horizontal with respect to ωc. Consequently,
the corresponding curve
t 
→α(t) := [(ΦA
t (p0), B)] ,
B ∈g ,
(6.8.1)
47See Remark 1.9.14/2.

6.8 Non-minimal Solutions
539
through [(p0, B)] ∈Ad(Pλ) is parallel with respect to the induced connection along
the curve t 
→γ (t) = ϕA
t ([1K]) through [1K] ∈M.
Since M is symmetric, the Levi-Civita connection ω0 of the symmetric space
is also canonical, see Proposition 2.5.10. Thus, the same arguments apply: taking
the canonical lift of the K-action to the frame bundle L(M) and viewing TM as a
bundle associated with L(M), for any frame e0 at [1K] and any X ∈T[1K]M ∼= m,
we consider the curve48
t 
→˜X(t) := [( ˜ϕA
t (e0), ι−1
e0 (X))]
(6.8.2)
in TM running through X. Here, t 
→˜ϕA
t (e0) is the unique integral curve of the Killing
vector ﬁeld on L(M), generated by A, through e0 ∈L(M). Again, by (1.9.43), ˜X is
parallel along γ with respect to ω0.
Now, for X, Y ∈T[1K]M, using the parallel extension along γ given by (6.8.2),
we calculate at t = 0:

∇(ω0+ωc)

( ˜X, ˜Y) = ∇(ω0+ωc)

Ωc( ˜X, ˜Y)

.
Finally, using the K-invariance of Ωc, we show that ∇(ω0+ωc)
˙γ

Ωc( ˜X, ˜Y)

= 0. For
that purpose, we denote the curvature form viewed as a 2-form on Pλ by ˜Ωc and use
the fact that horizontal lifts of tangent vectors from M to Pλ are given by Killing
vectors of the K-action Δ,
Xh
p = Δ′
p(X) ,
X ∈m ∼= T[1K]M .
Now, by the obvious identity

and by K-invariance of ˜Ωc, we have

quently, its covariant derivative along γ vanishes.

The Yang-Mills Equation
Clearly, this proposition yields a large class of solutions and we may ask whether this
class contains non-minimal solutions. To discuss this issue, recall that by Remark
1.9.14, the curvature of the canonical connection is given by
Ωc(X, Y) = −λ′([X, Y]) ,
X, Y ∈m .
(6.8.3)
Now, let Λ ∈HomH(m, g). By (1.9.41), it deﬁnes a 1-form α ∈Ω1(M, Ad(Pλ)). By
a similar argument as in the proof of Proposition 6.8.1, one shows that α is parallel.
Thus,
d∗
ωα = 0 ,
dωα = 0 ,
(6.8.4)
and we may take α as a variation of ωc. Thus, we consider ω t = ωc + tα, which by
construction is K-invariant for every t. Consequently, Ωωt is K-invariant, too.
Proposition 6.8.2 (Itoh) Let M = K/H be a compact oriented Riemannian symmet-
ric space and let Pλ be a principal G-bundle admitting a lift of K to automorphisms
of Pλ. Assume
dim

HomH(m, g)

≥1 .
Then, the canonical K-invariant connection ωc on Pλ is not weakly stable.
Proof We choose an orthonormal basis e1, . . . , en in m and denote the induced dual
coframe on M by ϑ1, . . . , ϑn. Using (6.7.3), (6.7.2), (6.8.3), (6.8.4) and (1.9.40), we
calculate

The last step is a straightforward calculation using the commutation relations of a
symmetric space (Exercise 6.8.2).49 The minus sign comes from the fact that the
Cartan-Killing tensor is negative deﬁnite for any semisimple Lie algebra. Thus, for
any Λ ̸= 0, we have a negative deﬁnite Hessian on directions generated by Λ.
■
In particular, let us consider the canonical connection ωc on Pλ for the case where
G is a compact simple Lie group and
49Note that, for a symmetric space, 
i[ei, [ei, ·]] coincides with the second Casimir operator of
ad(h)↾m.

6.8 Non-minimal Solutions
541
M = S4 ∼= Sp(2)/(Sp(1) × Sp(1)) ,
where Sp(1) × Sp(1) is embedded block-diagonally50 and λ : Sp(1) × Sp(1) →G.
In the notation above, we have K = Sp(2) and H = Sp(1) × Sp(1). Using formula
(6.8.3), it is easy to analyze (anti-)self-duality of the curvature form Ωc and, by direct
inspection of the conditions on Ωc obtained this way, one ﬁnds (Exercise 6.8.1):
Lemma 6.8.3 The induced homomorphism λ′ : sp(1) × sp(1) →g is injective iff
the canonical connection ωc is not (anti-)self-dual.
■
Since for g = su(2) or g = su(3) the homomorphisms λ′ cannot be injective,
in this case, the canonical connection is (anti-)self-dual. On the contrary, by direct
inspection of the table giving the classiﬁcation of regular semisimple Lie subalgebras
of a semisimple Lie algebra,51 if g = sp(2) or G2 or such that rank(g) ≥3, then
injective homomorphisms λ′ exist, that is, in these cases we have solutions to the
Yang-Mills equation which are not (anti-)self-dual. A simple example of this type
is provided by the Sp(2)-invariant sp(1) × sp(1)-valued connection ω0 deﬁned by
(6.3.7).52 Combining these observations with Proposition 6.8.2, we ﬁnd a large class
of non-minimal Yang-Mills connections on S4 which are not (anti-)self-dual. In
[339], the reader can also ﬁnd a similar analysis for M = CP2. In [402] and [384],
this line of research has been continued. In particular, for the special case of principal
H-bundles K →K/H with K/H being a compact symmetric space, in [402] the
index and the nullity of the canonical connection has been listed for every compact
simple K. Moreover, it has been shown there how to analyze the case of an arbitrary
homogeneous space, see also [503].
Special attention has been paid to the case of cohomogeneity one,53 see [638],
[88], [504], [549-551] and [44]. Here, the Yang-Mills equation reduces to a system
of ordinary second order differential equations for the coefﬁcient functions of the
invariant connection on a one-dimensional space. Correspondingly, the self-duality
condition is expressed in terms of a ﬁrst order system. Clearly, in general, there will
be nongeneric orbit types giving rise to boundary conditions for the solutions. Now, in
each class of invariant connections, one looks for solutions of this system of equations
corresponding to minima of the reduced action. The principle of symmetric criticality
[501] ensures that these minima correspond to stationary points of the Yang-Mills
action in the space of all connections. Thus, in this way one ﬁnds solutions of the
Yang-Mills equation. Subsequently, one may investigate whether they are minimal
or not. Much attention has been paid to the following model class.
Example 6.8.4 (Bor-Montgomery, Sadun-Segert) Let V be the 5-dimensional space
of real, symmetric and traceless 3 × 3 matrices endowed with the inner product
given by
50Cf. Sect.6.3 for details.
51Cf. the proof of Theorem 6.7.7.
52In sharp contrast, the induced connections ω± given by (6.3.8) are (anti-)self-dual.
53The cohomogeneity of a G-action is the dimension of the orbit space.

542
6
The Yang-Mills Equation
⟨Q1, Q2⟩:= 1
2 tr(Q1Q2⟩.
Clearly, SO(3) acts orthogonally on V by conjugation.54 Identiﬁying V with R5
and restricting this action to S4 ⊂R5 yields an action of SO(3) and, thus, also an
action of Sp(1) on S4. It is easy to see (Exercise 6.8.3) that this action has two orbit
types; the principal orbits are 3-dimensional and there are two nongeneric orbits
both isomorphic to the real 2-dimensional projective space. The orbit space may be
identiﬁed with a line segment on S4
I =

Qθ = cos θQ0 + sin θQ3 : 0 ≤θ ≤π
3

,
(6.8.5)
where Q0 and Q3 are basis elements in the subspace of diagonal matrices. Now, for
any gauge group G, one may classify G-bundles over S4 admitting a lift of the above
SO(3)-action and, subsequently, one may classify the SO(3)-invariant connections
on such bundles. If we ﬁrst limit our attention to the interior of I, then we are in the
situation described in Remark 1.9.9 and Corollary 1.9.15. Next, we have to extend
the classifying objects obtained this way by implementing appropriate smoothness
conditions on the boundary of I. This has been explained in detail in [638]. For the
case G = Sp(1), bundles admitting lifts are classiﬁed by pairs (n+, n−) of integers
fulﬁlling n± = 1 modulo 4.55 These numbers label the admissible boundary values
of the classifying homomorphisms λθ. It is easy to calculate the second Chern index
of a bundle characterized by (n+, n−). One obtains
c(n+,n−) = n2
+ −n2
−
8
.
For the case G = Sp(1), Sadun and Segert have shown that minima of the reduced
action exist for all n+ ̸= 1 and n−̸= 1. Moreover, they have proved that self-dual
connections only exist for n−= 1 and anti-self-dual connections only exist for
n+ = 1. Thus, this way one obtains non-self-dual solutions for all Chern numbers
different from ±1. The technical details of the existence proof (standard variational
techniques in one dimension) are given in [551]. Clearly, these techniques are not
constructive.
♦
Finally, let us mention two papers which are not based on the theory of invariant
connection, but rather on advanced variational techniques as developed by Taubes.
In [587], an iniﬁnite number of SU(2)-solutions invariant with respect to a U(1)-
action on S4 was found. In [648], the existence of an inﬁnite number of non-minimal
SU(2)-solutions on S2 × S2 and S3 × S1 was proved. The latter solutions do not
exhibit any symmetry.
54This is the irreducible representation of spin 2.
55For good reasons, these bundles are called quadrupole bundles, see [44] for an explanation.

Chapter 7
Matter Fields and Model Building
In this chapter, we include matter ﬁelds into our discussion. In Sect.7.1, we present
the general geometric model of matter ﬁelds in the ﬁbre bundle language. Then, in
Sects.7.2-7.5, we study various aspects of Yang-Mills-Higgs models. We discuss
the Higgs mechanism in detail, present a topological classiﬁcation of static ﬁnite-
energy conﬁgurations and address the problem of constructing asymptotic as well
as exact solutions to the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations. In particular, we focus on
magnetic monopole solutions including the discussion of the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-
Sommerﬁeld model. Next, in Sect.7.6, we pass to a U(1)-gauge model coupled
to a matter ﬁeld of spinorial type, the famous Seiberg-Witten model. The latter
has attracted much attention over the last two decades, because its moduli space
yields deep insight into the differential topology of 4-manifolds. In particular, it
yields new, simpler proofs of results earlier obtained via the theory of instantons.
We discuss the basic properties of this model in detail and outline some of the
topological consequences. Then, in Sect.7.7, we present the (classical) standard
model of elementary particle physics in the geometric language and, in the remaining
two sections, we discuss the method of dimensional reduction in the context of gauge
theories in some detail. The latter may be viewed as one of the classical uniﬁcation
schemes-a uniﬁcation in the spirit of Kaluza and Klein.

Usually, the spacetime manifold M will be endowed with some additional geometric
structures. Depending on the physical context, in the bundle language these structures
will be encoded either in the frame bundle L(M) or in the spin structure S(M).1 To

Matter Fields and Model Building
unify the notation, below, we write Q both for L(M) and for S(M) and call it the
spacetime principal bundle. Its structure group will be denoted by S. By Remark
1.1.9/2, given the spacetime principal bundle Q and the gauge principal bundle P,
we may build the ﬁbre product Q ×M P which is a principal (S × G)-bundle over
M. If we deal with both Q and P, then the right actions of S and G will be denoted
by ΨQ and ΨP, respectively, and the canonical projections of these bundles will be
denoted by πQ and πP, respectively. For the induced right action of S ×G on Q×M P
we will write Ψ and the canonical projection of Q ×M P will be denoted by π.
A classical matter ﬁeld model is described by the following data.
(a) The model is deﬁned on the tensor product
E = Es ⊗Ei ,
where Es is the bundle of spacetime degrees of freedom and Ei denotes the bundle
of internal degrees of freedom. The bundle Es comes in two fundamentally
different versions:
• Es is a tensor bundle over M, associated with the frame bundle L(M). In that
case, we speak of bosonic matter.
• Es is a spinor bundle associated with the spin structure S(M). Then we speak
of fermionic matter.
Thus,
Es = Q ×S Fs ,
where Fs is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space carrying a representation μ of S.
The bundle Ei is associated with the gauge principal bundle P,
Ei = P ×G Fi ,
where Fi is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space carrying a representation σ of
the gauge group G. Besides σ, the vector space Fi may carry an additional Lie
group representation corresponding to further internal degrees of freedom called
ﬂavour,2 see e.g. Sect.7.7 for the case of the standard model.
By Remark 1.2.9/2, E is associated with Q ×M P. The typical ﬁbre
F = Fs ⊗Fi
of E carries the tensor product representation μ⊗σ of the direct product S × G.
(Footnote 1 continued)
symmetric second-rank covariant tensors on Rn. Equivalently, it is encoded as a torsion-free metric
connection (Levi-Civita connection) on L(M).
2These are rigid symmetries not giving rise to local gauge transformations.

7.1 Matter Fields
547
(b) A matter ﬁeld of spacetime type μ and of gauge type σ is a section Φ ∈Γ ∞(E).3
It will be referred to as a matter ﬁeld of type (μ, σ). By Proposition 1.2.6, it may
be equivalently represented by an element ˜Φ ∈HomS×G(Q ×M P, F),
Φ(m) = [(z, ˜Φ(z))] ,
m ∈M , z ∈π−1(m) .
(7.1.1)
By Remark 1.2.15/3, ˜Φ and Φ have the same local representative ϕ : U →F
in any local trivialization over U ⊂M.
The coupling with a gauge potential is encoded in the covariant exterior deriva-
tive. This is called the principle of minimal coupling. As we know from Chaps.2
and 5, Q may carry various connections referred to as spacetime connections. By
Remark 1.3.17, if ωQ and ωP are spacetime and gauge connections, respectively,
then they induce a connection form ω on Q ×M P, given by (1.3.16). Omitting
the canonical projections to Q and P, we have ω = ωQ + ωP and, thus,
Dω ˜Φ = d ˜Φ +

μ′(ωQ) ⊗idFi + idFs ⊗σ ′(ωP)

◦˜Φ ,
(7.1.2)
cf. (1.4.2). Clearly, μ′(ωQ) ⊗idFi + idFs ⊗σ ′(ωP) must be viewed as a 1-form
on Q ×M P with values in End(F). It is obtained by differentiating the tensor
product representation μ ⊗σ. The corresponding covariant exterior derivative
of Φ is given by (1.5.3),
(∇ωΦ)m(X) = ιz ◦(Dω ˜Φ)z(Y) ,
(7.1.3)
where X = π′(Y), m ∈M and z ∈π−1(m). By (1.4.14), the covariant exterior
derivative of the local representative ϕ is given by
Dϕ = dϕ +

μ′(AQ) ⊗idFi + idFs ⊗σ ′(AP)

◦ϕ ,
(7.1.4)
where AQ and AP are the local representatives of ωQ and ωP, respectively.
(c) Let ϑQ and ϑP be local gauge transformations, that is, vertical automorphisms
of the principal bundles Q and P, respectively. Then, ϑ = ϑQ × ϑP is a local
gauge transformation in Q × P, which induces a local gauge transformation in
Q ×M P denoted by the same letter. In more detail, we have
ϑ : P ×M Q →P ×M Q ,
ϑ(m, (q, p)) =

m, (ϑQ(q), ϑP(p))

.
(7.1.5)
Clearly, any vertical automorphism of Q ×M P is of this type. An active local
gauge transformation of the matter ﬁeld ˜Φ is given by
˜Φ 
→ϑ∗˜Φ .
(7.1.6)
3As already noted under (a), Φ may further carry a certain ﬂavour type. If not otherwise stated, we
suppress these rigid degrees of freedom.

Clearly, ϑ∗˜Φ is of the same type as ˜Φ. By Proposition 1.8.3, ϑ is equivalently
described by an element u ∈HomS×G(Q ×M P, S × G), given by
ϑ(z) = Ψu(z)(z) .
Thus, using the equivariance of ˜Φ and decomposing u = uS × uG with respect
to the product structure of S × G, for any z ∈Q ×M P, we obtain
(ϑ∗˜Φ)(z) = ˜Φ ◦Ψu(z)(z) =

μuS(z)−1 ⊗σuG(z)−1 ˜Φ(z) .
(7.1.7)
Via (7.1.1), formula (7.1.6) induces a gauge transformation for Φ,
Φ 
→Φ′ ,
Φ′(m) = [(z, (ϑ∗˜Φ)(z))] ,
with π(z) = m. In terms of the corresponding vertical automorphism ˆϑ of the
associated bundle E provided by Proposition 1.8.4, we obtain
Φ′(m) = ˆϑ−1(Φ(m)) .
Finally, the gauge transformation of a local representative ϕ of Φ is given by
ϕ′(m) =

μρS(m)−1 ⊗σρG(m)−1
ϕ(m) ,
(7.1.8)
where ρS and ρG are transition functions of Q and P, respectively.
(d) The inﬁnite-dimensional vector space of smooth sections of E will be denoted
by E and will be referred to as the matter conﬁguration space. It can be endowed
with the structure of an inﬁnite-dimensional manifold. By point (c) it is acted
upon by a (right) representation of the group of local gauge transformations.
As in Sect.6.1, we assume that
(a) the spacetime manifold M is endowed with a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric g,
(b) the Lie algebra g of G carries an Ad(G)-invariant inner product ⟨·, ·⟩g,
(c) the vector space F carries a scalar product ⟨·, ·⟩F which is invariant with respect
to the representation μ ⊗σ of S × G.
Then, we can write down physical actions for matter ﬁelds.
(a) Let Φ be a bosonic matter ﬁeld of type (μ, σ). As explained before, the coupling
with a gauge potential ω is described in terms of the covariant derivative ∇ωΦ ∈
Ω1(M, E), cf. formula (7.1.2). The general gauge-invariant Lagrangian is of the
following form:
L (ω, Φ) := 1
2∇ωΦ
.∧∗∇ωΦ −V (Φ) ,

7.1 Matter Fields
549
where the dot refers to the ﬁbre metric ⟨·, ·⟩E in the tensor product E = Es ⊗Ei.
Here, V : F →R is a G-invariant function bounded from below which induces
a function on E via V ([(p, f )]) = V (f ). Then,
V (Φ) = V ◦Φ .
Correspondingly, we have V ( ˜Φ) = V ◦˜Φ = π∗V (Φ). In most of the applica-
tions, the potential is of the form
V (Φ) = V (|Φ|2) ,
where the norm refers to the ﬁbre metric in E. In that case, V may be viewed
as a function on R. The ﬁbre metric in Es is induced from the metric g and the
ﬁbre metric of Ei is given by ⟨·, ·⟩Fi via (2.6.4).
(b) Let ψ be a fermionic matter ﬁeld of type (μ, σ). Here, E is associated with
the ﬁbre product bundle S(M) ×M P. In the notation of Chap.5, the typical
gauge-invariant Lagrangian is of the following form:
L (ω, ψ) := ⟨ψ, /Dψ⟩−V (ψ) .
(7.1.9)
Moreover, there may occur a coupling between bosonic and fermionic matter ﬁelds.
This will be explained for the case of the standard model in Sect.7.7.
7.2
Yang-Mills-Higgs Systems
In this section, we introduce one of the fundamental building blocks of the standard
model describing the fundamental interactions of elementary particles.
Let (M, g) be an n-dimensional (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, let G be a com-
pact Lie group and let P(M, G) be a principal G-bundle over M. Let (F, G, σ) be a
representation of G and let E = P ×G F be the corresponding associated bundle. In
the terminology introduced in Sect.7.1, a Higgs ﬁeld Φ is a bosonic matter ﬁeld of
type (μ, σ), where μ is the trivial representation of O(n). That is, Φ is a spacetime
scalar ﬁeld. Thus, it may be simply viewed as a section of E or, equivalently, as an
element ˜Φ ∈HomG(P, F). As before, we assume that the Lie algebra g of G carries
an Ad(G)-invariant scalar product which we denote by ⟨·, ·⟩g or sometimes simply
by k. Moreover, we assume that F is endowed with a scalar product ⟨·, ·⟩F which is
invariant under the representation σ.
AYang-Mills-Higgsconﬁgurationisapair(ω, Φ),whereω isagaugeconnection
form on P. Thus, the conﬁguration space of a Yang-Mills-Higgs system is C × E .
In the notation of Sect.7.1, the action functional is given by

(7.2.1)
The second term in this formula describes the minimal coupling of the gauge potential
with the matter ﬁeld and V will be referred to as the Higgs potential. It describes the
self-interaction of the Higgs ﬁeld. Its typical form is
V (|Φ|2) = 1
2 μ2|Φ|2 + 1
4 λ|Φ|4 ,
(7.2.2)
where λ > 0. Depending on whether μ2 is positive or negative, the minimum of V
is either given by Φ = 0 or by
|Φ| =

−μ2
λ .
(7.2.3)
While in the ﬁrst case the minimum is invariant under the full gauge group G, in the
second case, the minima are only invariant under some subgroup H ⊂G and take
their value in some orbit G/H ⊂F. Thus, by an appropriate choice of the parameter
μ2 we may produce a symmetry reduction, that is, we may obtain a classical ground
state having a smaller symmetry than the original Lagrangian of the theory. In the
physics literature, this is commonly called spontaneous symmetry breaking.4 It will
be explained in detail in the next section.
Next, let us derive the ﬁeld equations via the variational principle for S(ω, Φ).
For that purpose, consider a variation of the conﬁguration (ω, Φ) given by
ωt = ω + tα ,
Φt = Φ + tτ ,
where α ∈Ω1(M, Ad(P)) and τ ∈Γ ∞(E). Using (2.7.54) and (7.1.2), we calculate

d

V (Φ(m) + tτ(m)) = V ′(Φ(m))(τ(m)) = ⟨V ′(Φ), τ⟩Em ,
and recalling the calculation for the pure Yang-Mills case from the beginning of
Sect.6.2, we obtain
4Here, we exclusively discuss the breaking of local gauge symmetry. For a discussion of global
symmetry breaking, we refer to [3] and references therein.

ω ◦dωΦ = V ′(Φ) .
(7.2.5)
This system of nonlinear partial differential equations will be referred to as the Yang-
Mills-Higgs equations with potential V . For the sake of completeness, let us also
recall Propositions 1.4.11 and 1.4.13. In the case under consideration, they read
dωΩ = 0 ,
dω ◦dωΦ = σ ′(Ω)Φ .
(7.2.6)
Clearly, the ﬁrst of these equations is the ordinary Bianchi identity for the curvature
form. By a slight abuse of terminology, the second identity may be called the Bianchi
identity for Φ.
Remark 7.2.1 In applications, (F, G, σ) often coincides with the adjoint represen-
tation (g, G, Ad). Then, the ﬁeld equations read
d∗
ωΩ = [∇ωΦ, Φ] ,
d∗
ω ◦dωΦ = V ′(Φ) ,
(7.2.7)
and the Bianchi identities take the form
dωΩ = 0 ,
dω ◦dωΦ = [Ω, Φ] .
(7.2.8)
♦
For the remainder of this section, we assume that M is the 4-dimensional
Minkowski space. Let us study the energy functional E(ω, Φ) of a Yang-Mills-
Higgs system for a chosen space-like hypersurface Σ0 ⊂M. Let (e0, . . . , e3) be the

standard basis in M and let x0, . . . , x3 be the corresponding standard coordinates.
We take Σ0 :=

x ∈M : x0 = const.

and decompose
M = Re0 × Σ0 .
(7.2.9)
Then, for any conﬁguration (ω, Φ), we restrict Ω and ∇ωΦ to Σ0 and decompose
them relative to (7.2.9),
Ω = Ωk0dxk ∧dx0 + 1
2Ωkldxk ∧dxl ,
∇ωΦ = ∇ω
0 Φdx0 + ∇ω
k Φdxk ,
where k = 1, 2, 3. We deﬁne
Ωe := Ωk0dxk ,
Ωm := 1
2Ωklεklmdxm ,
(7.2.10)
Π := ∇ω
0 Φ ,
DΦ := ∇ω
k Φdxk .
(7.2.11)
The 1-forms Ωe and Ωm on Σ0 are referred to as the colour electric and the colour
magnetic components of Ω, respectively. Note that (Exercise 7.2.1)
∗Ωm = i∗Ω ,
DΦ = i∗∇ωΦ ,
(7.2.12)
where i : Σ0 →M is the natural inclusion mapping.
Now, the energy functional is given by the integral over Σ0 of the component T00
of the energy-momentum tensor. For the Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, it reads5

Below, we will consider the static case.
Deﬁnition 7.2.2 A conﬁguration (ω, Φ) of a Yang-Mills-Higgs theory on M is
called static if it is invariant under time translations, that is, invariant under the
action of the additive group R on M given by
δ : R × M →M ,
δ(s, x) := (x0 + s, x1, x2, x3) .
Clearly, the translation invariant mapping Φ is simply given by its values on Σ0.
By Example 1.9.18, the R-invariant connection ω is uniquely characterized by a
5See e.g. [208].

7.2 Yang-Mills-Higgs Systems
553
connection ˜ω on the trivial principal bundle ˜P = Σ0 × G and by an equivariant
mapping ω0 from ˜P to L(Re0, g). We see that, in the static case, putting ω0 = 0 has a
geometric meaning. In accordance with the physics literature, we call this the tempo-
ral gauge. By making this choice, one restricts the admissible gauge transformations
to vertical automorphisms of ˜P. For a (global) representative A of ω, we have
A = A0dx0 + Akdxk .
Here, Akdxk and A0dx0 are the representatives of ˜ω and ω0, respectively, and the
temporal gauge reads A0 = 0. Clearly, we must show that the choice of the temporal
gauge is, in the static case, consistent with the ﬁeld equations: indeed, we then have
Π = 0 ,
J0 = 0 ,
Ωe = 0 ,
and, thus, the ﬁeld equations reduce to the following system of equations on Σ0:
d∗
ω ∗Ωm = J ,
D∗◦DΦ = V ′(Φ) ,
(7.2.14)
where J = −⟨(k−1 ⊗id) ◦σ ′(Φ), DΦ⟩F. Clearly, (7.2.14) are the ﬁeld equations of
a Yang-Mills-Higgs system on R3.
We conclude that, for the static theory in the temporal gauge, the energy functional
reduces to
E(ω, Φ) = 1

(7.2.15)
Thus, for any ﬁnite energy conﬁguration (ω, Φ), the differential forms Ωm and DΦ
must be square integrable and, for ∥x∥→∞,
∥x∥2V (Φ) →0 .
(7.2.16)
To analyze these requirements, let us consider condition (7.2.16) under the following
assumptions on V . Let Fmin ⊂F be the set of absolute minima of V . By invariance,
Fmin is a union of orbits of G. We assume that Fmin consists of a single orbit G/H. By
possibly shifting V , we may also assume that V vanishes on Fmin. From (7.2.16), we
conclude that, at large distances, the global representative ϕ of Φ must take values
in G/H. More precisely, we get a mapping
ϕ∞: S2 →G/H ,
ϕ∞(x) := lim
r→∞ϕ(rx) ,
(7.2.17)
that is, the asymptotic values of ϕ deﬁne an element [ϕ∞] ∈π2(G/H). Since the
mapping degree is a homotopy invariant, [ϕ∞] cannot be changed by continuous
deformations, that is, the space of ﬁnite-energy conﬁgurations decomposes into

554
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
topological sectors labelled by π2(G/H). Note that this statement is obtained without
any reference to the ﬁeld equations.
Remark 7.2.3 While it seems to us that the investigation of ﬁnite energy conﬁgura-
tions is interesting in itself, the study of these topological sectors has attracted special
attention, because in realistic models they characterize magnetic monopole conﬁg-
urations, see [140, 249, 251, 314, 315, 566, 610]. In the literature, by an abuse of
language, the topological charges to be constructed below are often called magnetic
charges. In order to justify this terminology one must, of course, accommodate the
electromagnetic ﬁeld in a gauge invariant way in the model under consideration. In
particular, after symmetry breaking, the residual gauge group H should contain only
one U(1)-factor, because there should be only one electromagnetic ﬁeld. We will
discuss an example of this type in Sect.7.4.
♦
It turns out that, apart from a possible torsion part, π2(G/H) may be characterized
in terms of integral invariants induced from closed invariant 2-forms on G/H. Fol-
lowing Horvathy and Rawnsley [315], let us construct these invariants: let us assume
that H is connected. Let θG be the Maurer-Cartan form on G. Take the standard
direct sum decomposition
g = c ⊕[h, g] ,
(7.2.18)
where c is the centralizer of h in g and consider the projection prc : g →c onto
the ﬁrst summand. Then, prc(dθG) is a closed 2-form on G which is obviously right
H-invariant and left G-invariant (Exercise 7.2.2). Thus, it descends to an invariant 2-
form η on G/H with values in c . With π : G →G/H being the canonical projection,
we have
π∗η = prc(dθG) .
(7.2.19)
We deﬁne
ρ : π2(G/H) →c ,
ρ([ϕ∞]) := 1
2π

S2 ϕ∗
∞η .
(7.2.20)
Since η is closed, this integral depends only on the homotopy class of ϕ∞and, thus,
ρ is correctly deﬁned.
Now,6 ﬁx a maximal torus in H, denote its Lie algebra by t and take the unit lattice
Γ := {X ∈h : exp(2πX) = 1} ∩t .
Let z denote the Lie algebra of the center of H, consider the standard direct sum
decomposition
h = z ⊕[h, h]
(7.2.21)
and let prz : h →z be the canonical projection onto the ﬁrst summand. Choose a
Z-basis {ζ1, . . . , ζp} of prz(Γ ) and extend it to a basis {ζ1, . . . , ζp, . . . , ζq} of c. Then,
6For the basic Lie algebraic notions used in the sequel, we refer to Appendix C or to [329] for more
details.

7.2 Yang-Mills-Higgs Systems

decomposing η with respect to this basis, we get a family {ηk} of closed invariant
2-forms on G/H:
η =
q

k=1
ηkζk .
(7.2.22)
Note that ηk = f k(η) for the dual basis {f 1, . . . , f q}. It can be shown easily (Exercise
7.2.3) that, for k > p, the 2-forms ηk are exact. Thus, if we insert the decomposition
(7.2.22) into (7.2.20), they do not contribute to the integral in (7.2.20) and we obtain

(7.2.24)
In particular, ρ takes values in z. In Proposition 7.2.5, we will show that m1, . . . , mp
is a p-tuple of integers. These integers are called the topological charges of the
Yang-Mills-Higgs system.
Remark 7.2.4 For the special case of the adjoint representation, η is given by the
Kirillov symplectic form, cf. Sect.8.4 of Part I. In more detail, let X0 = ϕ∞(x0) ∈g
be a point with stabilizer H and let G · X0 ∼= G/H be the adjoint orbit through X0.
Then, every Z ∈z deﬁnes a surjective mapping πZ : G · X0 →G · Z. We set
ηZ := π∗
Z ωZ ,
(7.2.25)
where ωZ is the Kirillov form on the orbit through Z. Then, for a chosen Z-basis,
formula (7.2.25) yields a family of invariant 2-forms which coincide with the one
deﬁned above. This is a simple consequence of the Maurer-Cartan equation (Exercise
7.2.4).
♦
Next, due to π2(G) = 0, the long exact homotopy sequence of the principal H-bundle
π : G →G/H implies that the connecting homomorphism
δ : π2(G/H) →π1(H)
(7.2.26)
is injective. In particular, if G is simply connected, then δ is an isomorphism. The
homomorphism δ is deﬁned as follows: choose a covering of S2 given in spherical
coordinates by
U1 =

x(ϑ, φ) ∈S2 : 0 ≤ϑ < π
2 + ε

, U2 =

x(ϑ, φ) ∈S2 : π
2 −ε < ϑ ≤π

.
Since U1 and U2 are contractible, there exist smooth mappings gi : Ui →G ,
i = 1, 2 , such that

556
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
ϕ∞(x) = σ(gi(x))[1] ≡π ◦gi(x) ,
(7.2.27)
where [1] ∈G/H = Fmin is a chosen point. Then, on the equator S1 given by θ = π
2 ,
γ : S1 →H ,
γ (x) := g−1
1 (x)g2(x)
(7.2.28)
is a loop in H. Let [γ ] be the corresponding homotopy class. Then,
δ([ϕ∞]) = [γ ] .
(7.2.29)
Now, consider the decomposition (7.2.21). Let Hss be the connected Lie subgroup
of H whose Lie algebra is [h, h]. It is compact and semisimple and, since [h, h]
is an ideal, it is also normal. Thus, H/Hss is a compact connected Lie group with
Lie algebra z. Since the latter is Abelian, H/Hss must be a torus and, therefore,
π1(H/Hss) ∼= Zp, where p = dim z. Moreover, since Hss is compact and semisimple,
T = π1(Hss) is a ﬁnite Abelian group. Finally, using the homotopy sequence of the
ﬁbration Hss →H →H/Hss and the fact that π1(H/Hss) is free Abelian, we obtain
the following structure of the fundamental group of the compact connected Lie group
H [315]:
π1(H) = Zp ⊕T .
(7.2.30)
The Zp-part yields a p-tuple of integers which are deﬁned as follows: let θH be the
Maurer-Cartan form of H. Then, by the Maurer-Cartan equation, prz(θH) is a closed
z-valued 1-form on H. We deﬁne
λ : π1(H) →z ,
λ([γ ]) := 1
2π

γ
prz(θH) .
(7.2.31)
Since prz(θH) is closed, the integral only depends on the homotopy class of γ , that is,
λ is well deﬁned. As above, decomposing it with respect to a Z-basis yields a p-tuple
(m1([γ ]), . . . , mp([γ ])) ∈Zp. We show that, with respect to the same Z-basis, these
integers coincide with the numbers mk([ϕ∞]) deﬁned by (7.2.24).
Proposition 7.2.5 (Horvathy-Rawnsley) For any [ϕ∞] ∈π2(G/H), we have
ρ([ϕ∞]) = λ ◦δ([ϕ∞]) .
Proof In the notation above, let S1 be the equatorial circle of S2. Using Stokes'
Theorem together with (7.2.27), we calculate

By (7.2.29), the assertion follows.
■
Since δ is injective, we conclude that the integers mk([ϕ∞]) deﬁned by (7.2.24)
generate the free part of π2(G/H). Its torsion part coincides with the kernel of ρ.
Clearly, this part cannot be determined by means of invariants built from differential
forms.
Remark 7.2.6 We note that if the T-part in the decomposition (7.2.30) is nontrivial,
then Zn-charges may occur, see e.g. [249, 653] and further references therein. The
simplest example of this type is H = SO(3) with π1(H) = Z2.
♦
It remains to analyze the condition
Dϕ = 0
(7.2.32)
for ∥x∥→∞. By Proposition 1.6.10, it implies that ω asymptotically takes values
in the Lie algebra h of H. This clearly means that asymptotically Ωm takes values in
h, too. We will show that (7.2.32) implies a presentation of the topological invariant
(7.2.20) in terms of the curvature. To ﬁnd it, let A and F be global representatives
of ω and Ω, respectively. In what follows, let S2
r = {x ∈R3 : ∥x∥= r}. We say that
a relation holds on S2
∞if it holds asymptotically on S2
r for r →∞and we write

S2∞
for limr→∞

S2r . For clearness of presentation, we ﬁrst limit our attention to the case
where ϕ is in the adjoint representation.
Proposition 7.2.7 For any contractible open subset U ⊂S2
∞, the following holds:
ϕ · F = d(ϕ · A) + ϕ0 · (ϕ∗η) ,
(7.2.33)
where ϕ0 ∈Fmin has stabilizer H and the dot denotes the Killing form.

558
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
Proof By (7.2.32), dϕ = −[A, ϕ]. Using this and the Structure Equation, we ﬁnd
ϕ · F = ϕ · dA + 1
2ϕ · [A, A]
= d(ϕ · A) −dϕ
.∧A + 1
2ϕ · [A, A]
= d(ϕ · A) −ϕ · [A, A] + 1
2ϕ · [A, A]
= d(ϕ · A) −1
2ϕ · [A, A] .
Thus, it remains to analyze ϕ · [A, A] on U. Since U is contractible and ϕ takes
values in a single orbit Fmin, there exists a mapping g : U →G such that
ϕ0 = Ad(g−1)ϕ ,
for a chosen vector ϕ0 ∈g with stabilizer H, that is, ϕ0 ∈c . We put
A = Ad(g−1)A + g∗θG .
Then, dϕ0 = 0 and, by (7.2.32), [A, ϕ0] = 0. Thus, A takes values in h. Using
this and the fact that the decomposition (7.2.18) is orthogonal, together with the
Ad-invariance of the Killing form and the Maurer-Cartan equation, we get
ϕ · [A, A] = ϕ0 · [A −g∗θG, A −g∗θG] = g∗(ϕ0 · [θG, θG]) = −2g∗(ϕ0 · dθG) .

where powers are taken in the universal enveloping algebra. Even more gener-

adjoint representation to an arbitrary representation σ. Then, the Killing form
is replaced by a bilinear invariant function f : g × F →R, that is, a function
fulﬁlling
f (Ad(g)X, σ(g)x) = f (X, x) ,
X ∈g , x ∈F , g ∈G .

Finally, it is of course interesting to look for ﬁnite energy solutions of the system
(7.2.14). Under the additional assumption V = 0, this question will be addressed in
Sect.7.5. On the other hand, for the issues to be discussed below, it is illuminating
to ﬁnd the asymptotic solutions of (7.2.14). In this case, the ﬁnite energy condition
implies that the system decouples and, as can be easily seen, the second equation just
yields a fall-off law for the radial dependence of Φ. Thus, within each topological
sector deﬁned by [ϕ] ∈π2(G/H), we are left with the pure Yang-Mills equation on
R3 with gauge group H. To study its asymptotic solution, we choose a representative
A of ω and choose the radial gauge7 x · A(x) = 0. Then, asymptotically, (7.2.14)
reduces to the Yang-Mills equation on the 2-sphere S2. This equation has been solved
by Atiyah and Bott in the general context of an arbitrary Riemannian surface M, see
Theorem 6.7 in [33]. We also refer to Friedrich and Habermann [220], who worked
out the case of the two-sphere in detail. Following their paper, we present the proof
for this case here.
Assume that H is a compact connected Lie group. We ﬁrst observe that any
homomorphism τ : U(1) →H deﬁnes a Yang-Mills connection over S2 as follows:
we take the complex Hopf bundle S3(S2, U(1)), cf. Example 1.1.20, endowed with
the canonical connection ωc, cf. Example 1.3.20, and build the associated principal
H-bundle
Pτ := S3 ×U(1) H .
Recall the natural injective bundle morphism ι : S3 →Pτ given by ι(x) := [(x, 1H)].
By Proposition 1.3.13, the transport of ωc under ι yields a unique connection ωτ on
Pτ fulﬁlling ι∗ωτ = dτ ◦ωc. Since the curvature of ωc is given by8 ˜Ωc = i
2 ⊗π∗vS2,
7For a rigorous existence proof we refer to [637]. This gauge is also used in the physics literature.
8For clearness, here we have denoted the curvature, viewed as a horizontal 2-form on the bun-
dle, by ˜Ωc. Since we deal with a 2-dimensional base space, by (1.2.14), we have ˜Ωc = 
∗Ωc⊗π∗vS2

Matter Fields and Model Building
where vS2 is the canonical volume form of S2, ωc is a Yang-Mills connection. Since
ι∗Ωτ = dτ ◦Ωc, the induced connection ωτ is Yang-Mills, too. To summarize,
denoting by YM(S2, H) the set of pairs (P, ω), where P is a principal H-bundle over
S2 and ω is a Yang-Mills connection on P, we obtain a mapping
χ : Hom(U(1), H) →YM(S2, H) ,
χ(τ) := (Pτ, ωτ) .
(7.2.36)
The following is a simple exercise which we leave to the reader (Exercise 7.2.5).
Lemma 7.2.10 Let τ and ˜τ belong to Hom(U(1), H). Then, τ and ˜τ are conjugate
under inner automorphisms of H iff the corresponding pairs (Pτ, ωτ) and (P˜τ, ω˜τ)
are equivalent, that is, if there exists a vertical isomorphism ϑ : Pτ →P˜τ such that
ϑ∗ω˜τ = ωτ.
Usingthis lemma, bypassingtoequivalenceclasses, weobtainthefollowinginjective
mapping:
˜χ : 
Hom(U(1), H) →
YM(S2, H) ,
˜χ([τ]) := [(Pτ, ωτ)] .
(7.2.37)
Lemma 7.2.11 Let (P, S2, H) be a principal ﬁbre bundle and let Γ be a Yang-Mills
connection on P. Then, the holonomy group of Γ is either trivial or U(1).
Proof Let Hp0(Γ ) be the holonomy group and let Pp0(Γ ) be the holonomy bundle
of Γ with respect to a chosen point p0 ∈P. Let ω be the connection form of Γ and let
Ω be its curvature form. As a 2-form on S2, Ω necessarily has the form Ω = B vS2 ,
where B = ∗Ω is a section of Ad(P). In terms of B, the Yang-Mills equation reads
dωB = 0 ,
(7.2.38)
that is, B is covariantly constant. Thus, the corresponding equivariant mapping ˜B :
P →g fulﬁls ˜B(p) = Q for some ﬁxed Q ∈h and all p ∈Pp0(Γ ). Now, by
Proposition 1.7.12, Γ is reducible to Pp0(Γ ) and, by the Ambrose-Singer Theorem
1.7.15, the Lie algebra of Hp0(Γ ) is spanned by Q. Therefore, Hp0(Γ ) is discrete
or 1-dimensional. But, by Remark 1.7.11, Hp0(Γ ) is connected and, thus, it is either
trivial or U(1) or R. Suppose Hp0(Γ ) = R. Then, Pp0(Γ ) is trivial and, for a chosen
global section s : S2 →Pp0(Γ ), the Yang-Mills equation (7.2.38) for the reduced
(Abelian) connection ˆω with curvature ˆΩ yields
s∗ˆΩ = d(s∗ˆω) = cvS2 ,
c ∈R .
Integrating this equation over S2 and using Stokes' Theorem, we ﬁnd c = 0 which
contradicts the irreducibility of ˆω.
■
(Footnote 8 continued)
with π : S3 →S2 denoting the canonical projection. Below, usually the curvature will be viewed
as a 2-form with values in Ad(P).

7.2 Yang-Mills-Higgs Systems
561
From the proof, we conclude that the local representative of the curvature with respect
to a local section in the holonomy bundle is given by
F = QvS2 .
(7.2.39)
Theorem 7.2.12 (Atiyah-Bott) The mapping ˜χ given by (7.2.37) yields a one-to-
one correspondence between conjugacy classes of homomorphisms U(1) →H and
equivalence classes of Yang-Mills connections over S2.
Proof It remains to show that ˜χ is surjective, that is, given any (P, ω) ∈YM(S2, H)
we must construct a homomorphism τ : U(1) →H such that (Pτ, ωτ) is equivalent
to (P, ω).
1. Consider the case H = U(1). Then, in the same notation as above, the Yang-
Mills equation implies that on Pp0(Γ ) we have ˜B = 
∗Ω = ic for some c ∈R. Since
the ﬁrst Chern index
c1(P) =

S2 c1(P) = −1
2πi

S2 tr(Ω) = −ic
2πi4π = −2c
(7.2.40)
is an integer, the mapping
τ : U(1) →U(1) ,
τ(ei2πt) := ei4πtc
is a homomorphism. We show that the induced pair (Pτ, ωτ) is equivalent to (P, ω).
Since the adjoint bundle of a principal U(1)-bundle over S2 is trivial, we may view
the curvatures of the connections under consideration as iR-valued 2-forms on S2.
In this sense, we obtain
Ωτ = dτ ◦Ωc = dτ
 i
2

vS2 = icvS2 = Ω .
Thus, we have c1(P) = c1(Pτ), that is, by Theorem 4.8.1, there exists a vertical
isomorphism ϑ1 : Pτ →P of principal U(1)-bundles. The curvature of ϑ∗
1 ω coin-
cides with Ω and thus with the curvature of ωτ. Since the curvatures of ϑ∗
1 ω and ωτ
coincide, there exists a vertical automorphism of Pτ transforming ϑ∗
1 ω to ωτ. Indeed,
since the adjoint bundle is trivial, there exists an iR-valued 1-form α on S2 such that
ϑ∗
1 ω −ωτ = π∗
τ α. By equality of the curvatures, we get dα = 0. Now, vanishing of
the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology group of S2 implies the existence of a potential λ of
α. This proves the assertion for G = U(1).
2. Now, let H be an arbitrary compact connected Lie group. Then, ω reduces to
a connection form ˆω on the holonomy bundle Pp0(Γ ), where Γ is the connection
corresponding to ω. By Lemma 7.2.11, the holonomy group Hp0(Γ ) is either trivial
or U(1). Thus, by point 1, we have a homomorphism ˆτ : U(1) →Hp0(Γ ) and, by
Theorem 1.7.9, ˆτ yields a homomorphism
τ : U(1) →H ,
τ(ei2πt) = exp(4πQt) ,
(7.2.41)

Matter Fields and Model Building
where Q is the generator of Hp0(Γ ) given by (7.2.39). Also by point 1, there exists
an isomorphism ˆϑ : Pˆτ →Pp0(Γ ) such that ˆϑ∗ˆω = ωˆτ which obviously can be
extended to an isomorphism ϑ : Pτ →P yielding the equivalence of (P, ω) and
(Pτ, ωτ).
■
Remark 7.2.13
1. According to Theorem 7.2.12, ﬁnite energy asymptotic solutions of the Yang-
Mills-Higgs system are classiﬁed by conjugacy classes of elements Q ∈h
satisfying the following quantization condition
exp(4πQ) = 1H .
(7.2.42)
Inserting (7.2.41) into (7.2.31) and using (7.2.29), we obtain
ρ([ϕ∞]) = prz(2Q) ,
(7.2.43)
that is, Q determines the invariants discussed before completely. As a conse-
quence, 2Q deﬁnes a topological charge.
2. By (7.2.39), the curvature F of any solution A fulﬁls F = QvS2. In spherical
coordinates (ϑ, φ) on S2, the solution A is given by
Aϑ = 0 ,
Aφ = ±(1 ∓cos ϑ)Q .
(7.2.44)
Note that A, extended to a gauge potential on R3, has a singularity at the origin
and, thus, an inﬁnite energy. Also note that these solutions are spherically sym-
metric, cf. Example 1.9.17 for the case H = SU(2) or [424] for general H. We
will come back to these solutions in Sect.7.4.
3. By studying the Hessian in the same spirit as in Sect.6.7, the stability of the
above Yang-Mills connections can be analyzed,9 see [33] for the general case
of a Riemannian surface M and [100, 220, 313, 316] for M = S2. We also refer
to [691] for a pedagogical presentation. The number of negative modes of the
Hessian turns out to be equal to
n = 2

q
(2|q| −1)
where the half integers q are the nonzero eigenvalues of Q with respect to a
chosen root system. Thus, stability only holds if Q has eigenvalues 0, ± 1
2.
4. It can be shown that critical points of the Yang-Mills functional on S2 correspond
to critical points of the energy functional on the loop space ΩH, see [220].
♦
9Since, here, we are on S2, methods of complex analysis can be applied.

The Higgs Mechanism
In this section, we explain the announced spontaneous symmetry breaking induced
by the Higgs potential V . Assume μ2 < 0. Recall that Φ is equivalently described
by an element ˜Φ ∈HomG(P, F).
Deﬁnition 7.3.1 Let Fmin ⊂F be the set of absolute minima of the potential V . A
Higgs ﬁeld ˜Φ ∈HomG(P, F) is called a Higgs vacuum if ˜Φ(P) ⊂Fmin.
In the sequel, Higgs vacua will be denoted by ˜Φv. Clearly, Fmin is a level set of the
smooth function V . In the sequel, we assume that V ′ is nowhere vanishing on Fmin.
Then, by the Level Set Theorem, Fmin is an embedded submanifold of F. Since V is
invariant under the representation σ, the level set Fmin is a union of orbits of σ.
Proposition 7.3.2 Assume that Fmin consists of a single orbit of σ. Let H ⊂G be
the stabilizer of some point f ∈Fmin. Then, Higgs vacua are in one-to-one corre-
spondence with reductions of P to the structure group H.
Proof Since, by assumption, Fmin is a transitive G-manifold, the assertion is an
immediate consequence of Proposition 1.6.2.
■
The subbundle deﬁned by a Higgs vacuum ˜Φv is given by (1.6.2),
Qf = {p ∈P : ˜Φv(p) = f } .
Remark 7.3.3
1. Again, let f ∈Fmin and H = Gf . Then, viewed as a section Φv ∈Γ ∞(E), a Higgs
vacuum takes values in the subbundle P ×G G/H ⊂E deﬁned by the embedding
[(p, gH)] 
→[(p, σ(g)f )]. Thus, Proposition 7.3.2 also follows from Corollary
1.6.5.

2. The existence of Higgs vacua or, equivalently, the existence of reductions of P to
suitable subgroups of G depends on the topology of P. If P is trivial, then Higgs
vacua always exist.
3. Let ϑ be a vertical automorphism of P. By gauge invariance of V , if ˜Φv is a
Higgs vacuum, then the gauge transformed ﬁeld ϑ∗˜Φv is also a Higgs vacuum. By
Proposition 1.6.4, Higgs vacua are gauge equivalent iff the corresponding bundle
reductions are equivalent. Thus, gauge equivalence classes of Higgs vacua are
in one-to-one correspondence with equivalence classes of reductions of P to the
subgroup H.
4. A similar characterization of Higgs vacua may be obtained under the following
weaker assumptions:
(a) Fmin consists of orbits belonging to the same orbit type.
(b) The projection Fmin →Fmin/G is trivial, that is, there exists a submanifold
Σ ⊂Fmin which is intersected by each orbit in Fmin exactly once.
Under these assumptions, one may choose Σ in such a way that all its elements
have the same stabilizer. Then,
Q = {p ∈P : ˜Φv(p) ∈Σ}
is a reduction of P to the subgroup H. Conversely, given such a reduction, it
obviously deﬁnes a Higgs vacuum.
♦
Now, let there be given a Higgs vacuum ˜Φv and assume, as before, that Fmin consists
of a single orbit. Let f ∈Fmin, let H = Gf and let i : Qf →P be the corresponding
bundle reduction to the structure group H. As usual, denote the Lie algebras of G
and H by g and h, respectively. Since G is compact, we can choose a direct sum
decomposition
g = h ⊕m
(7.3.1)
whichisorthogonalwithrespecttotheAd-invariantscalarproduct.Then,thisdecom-
position is automatically reductive. In the sequel, we will call (ω, ˜Φ) a conﬁguration
of type [H] if ω is irreducible and ˜Φ takes values in the stratum F[H]. Clearly, if
(ω, ˜Φ) is of type [H], then every gauge equivalent conﬁguration is of type [H], too.
Proposition 7.3.4 Assume that the representation σ acts transitively on the unit
sphere in F. Let ˜Φv be a Higgs vacuum, let f ∈Fmin and let H = Gf . Let Qf be the
H-reduction of P deﬁned by ˜Φv. Then, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
gauge equivalence classes of conﬁgurations [(ω, ˜Φ)] of type [H] and triples

[( ˆω, τ)], η

, where
1. ˆω is a connection form on Qf ,
2. τ is is a horizontal 1-form of type Ad(H)m on Qf ,
3. η is a function on Qf with values in the [H]-stratum of the orbit space F/G.
The equivalence class [( ˆω, τ)] is taken with respect to gauge transformations on Qf .

7.3 The Higgs Mechanism
565
Proof By the assumption on σ, for any representative (ω, ˜Φ) ∈[(ω, ˜Φ)], we can
ﬁnd a gauge transformation ϑ on P such that
ϑ∗˜Φ
∥ϑ∗˜Φ∥
=
f
∥f ∥.
(7.3.2)
That is, for any [(ω, ˜Φ)], we may limit our attention to representatives fulﬁlling this
condition. Let (ω, ˜Φ) be one such representative. Consider its restriction (i∗ω, i∗˜Φ)
to Qf , where i : Qf →P is the canonical inclusion mapping. Using (7.3.1), decom-
pose
i∗ω = i∗ωh + i∗ωm ,
i∗Φ = f + ˜φ .
(7.3.3)
Denote ˆω = i∗ωh and τ = i∗ωm. Then, the following hold.
(a) By Proposition 1.6.8, ˆω is a connection form on Qf and τ is a horizontal 1-form
of type Ad(H)m on Qf .
(b) By construction, ˜φ : Qf →F is equivariant with respect to the H-action. By
(7.3.2) and (7.3.3), we have ˜φ = ∥˜φ∥f
∥f ∥. Thus, ˜φ is completely characterized
by the gauge-invariant matter ﬁeld
η : Qf →F/G ≡R+ ,
η(q) := ∥˜φ∥,
taking values in the stratum of type [H] of the orbit space F/G.
Thus, the conﬁguration (ω, ˜Φ) fulﬁlling (7.3.2) is characterized by the triple ( ˆω, τ, η)
of geometric objects living on Qf . Next, consider another representative (ω′, ˜Φ′) of
[(ω, ˜Φ)], also fulﬁlling (7.3.2). Then, since the norm of ˜Φ is gauge invariant, we have
˜Φ′ = ˜Φ and ω′ is the image of ω under an H-valued gauge transformation. Conse-
quently, the construction based on the decomposition (7.3.3) yields a conﬁguration
( ˆω′, τ ′) which is equivalent to ( ˆω, τ) under vertical automorphisms of Qf .
Conversely, by standard arguments,10 given a triple

( ˆω, τ), η

, the conﬁguration
(ω, ˜Φ) may be reconstructed uniquely up to a gauge transformation.
■
To our knowledge, the fact that the symmetry breaking mechanism is related to
principal bundle reductions was ﬁrst observed by Trautman [631], see also [227,
362, 540].
Remark 7.3.5
1. The connection ˆω is the gauge potential corresponding to the broken symmetry.
According to the terminology in Sect.7.1, τ is a bosonic matter ﬁeld. In the
sequel, it will be called an intermediate vector boson of gauge type Ad(H)m.
Finally, η will be referred to as the surviving Higgs ﬁeld.
10In particular, recall from Proposition 1.6.7 that the associated vector bundles P ×G F and Q×H F
are isomorphic.

2. If ˜Φ takes values in more than one orbit type, then interesting topological effects
may occur. In the next section, we will discuss the case when Φ vanishes on some
subset of M. This may give rise to magnetic monopoles. In a general setting, one
speaks in this context of defects related to a broken symmetry, see [444].
♦
Let us calculate the action functional (7.2.1) after the symmetry breaking, that is, in
terms of the classifying objects given by Proposition 7.3.4. Denoting ˆf =
f
∥f ∥and
ηv = ∥f ∥, we calculate
i∗Ω = Ω ˆω + D ˆωτ + 1

and
i∗(V ( ˜Φ)) = 1
2 μ2(ηv + η)2 + 1
4 λ(ηv + η)4 .
Thus, using the orthogonality of the decomposition (7.3.1), we obtain the following
reduced action functional
ˆS( ˆω, τ, η) =1
2∥Ω ˆω + 1
2[τ, τ]h∥2 + 1
2∥D ˆωτ + 1

2∥dη∥2

2(ηv + η)2∥σ ′(τ)ˆf ∥2 + V (η) ,
(7.3.4)
where the indices h and m denote the projection onto h and m, respectively. The physi-
cal interpretation of the terms occurring in (7.3.4) is as follows: the ﬁrst term gives the
Yang-Mills functional for the reduced gauge potential ˆω (modiﬁed by an additional
summand), the second and the third term are standard kinetic action functionals for
the matter ﬁelds τ and η, the fourth term contains a typical mass contribution for the
intermediate vector boson τ, together with a contribution describing the interaction
of τ and η and the last term is a self-interaction term of the surviving Higgs ﬁeld
η. In particular, it contains a mass term. To summarize, we see that in the process
of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the intermediate vector bosons acquire a mass.
This is referred to as the Higgs mechanism,11 see [106, 186, 273, 274, 298-300, 364]
for the classical literature.
Remark 7.3.6 Since σ ′(Ad(h)A) = σ(h) ◦σ ′(A) ◦σ(h−1), for any h ∈H and any
A ∈m, the bilinear form
⟨·, ·⟩m : m × m →R ,
⟨A, B⟩m := ⟨σ ′(A)ˆf , σ ′(B)ˆf ⟩
is an H-invariant scalar product on m. Thus,
11In a realistic model, like the standard model of elementary particle physics, a large number of
fermionic ﬁelds describing matter occur. All these ﬁelds, except for the neutrino ﬁeld, also acquire
a mass via the Higgs mechanism. This will be explained in Sect.7.7.

Let us illustrate the Higgs mechanism for a toy model with gauge group SU(2).
Example 7.3.7 (Georgi-Glashowmodel)ConsiderthetrivialprincipalSU(2)-bundle
P = M × SU(2) over Minkowski space M and the associated bundle E ≡Ad(P) =
P×SU(2)su(2). This model is often called the Georgi-Glashow model of electroweak
interactions. Using the Lie algebra isomorphism su(2) ∼= so(3) ∼= R3 and the iden-
tiﬁcation of the adjoint representation of SO(3) with its deﬁning representation on
R3, cf. Examples I/5.2.8 and I/5.4.7, we obtain
E ∼= P ×SO(3) R3 .
(7.3.6)
Since the bundles are trivial, we may describe any conﬁguration (ω, Φ) in terms of
its (global) representatives (A, ϕ) on M. In the standard basis {ea} , a = 1, 2, 3 , on
R3, we write ϕ = ϕaea. Now, consider the action functional (7.2.1), with the Higgs
potential given by (7.2.2). Then, for μ2 < 0, the minimum of V is given by
∥ϕ∥2 ≡ϕaϕa = −μ2
λ .
(7.3.7)
Thus, Fmin coincides with a 2-sphere S2 ⊂R3 of radius ηv =

it consists of a single orbit. We choose
f = ηve3 ≡

The stabilizer of f is

(7.3.8)
Since P is trivial, it admits a reduction to the subgroup H and, thus, there exists
a Higgs vacuum ϕv. Since M is topologically trivial, any such reduction is again
trivial and thus equivalent to the subbundle Qf = M × SO(2) with the embedding
i : Qf →P deﬁned by (7.3.8). Clearly, the Higgs vacuum corresponding to this
reduction is given by
ϕv(x) = f ,
for all x ∈M. The orthogonal reductive decomposition (7.3.1) has the form
so(3) = so(2) ⊕m ,
(7.3.9)

where m ∼= R2 . Note that under this identiﬁcation, the restriction of H = SO(2) to
m coincides with the deﬁning representation of SO(2).

Here, A is an so(2)- or u(1)-valued gauge potential, which may be viewed as a model
of the photon ﬁeld. The intermediate vector boson V is an R2-valued covector ﬁeld
carrying the deﬁning representation of SO(2). Alternatively, we may view it as a
complex-valued covector ﬁeld V = A1 + iA2 carrying the deﬁning representation
of U(1). Since F/G = R3/SO(3) ∼= R+ ∪{0}, for a conﬁguration of type [SO(2)],
the surviving Higgs ﬁeld η is a function on M with values in R+.

sible for the mass generation in the reduced action (7.3.4). With ϕ = (ηv + η)e3,

given by ηv.
♦
Up until now, we have merely assumed that an absolute minimum of the Higgs
potential exists and we have drawn consequences from this fact. In the remainder
of this section, we will brieﬂy discuss the existence problem in a model indepen-
dent way. There is a huge literature on this subject which, on the mathematical
side, is related to modern equivariant bifurcation theory [196, 197, 252] and alge-
braic geometry. The classical papers on this subject are by Michel, Radicati, Abud
and Sartori, see [5, 6, 443-446, 557, 558] and further references therein. For fur-
ther developments, including an extension to the Yang-Mills functional, see also
[229-231]. It should be noted that mechanisms of spontaneous symmetry breaking
play a role in various branches of physics, or, even more generally of natural sciences.
Among the classical papers cited above, [444] gives a nice overview. Our focus is
rather on gauge theories only.
As already mentioned at the beginning, for a given gauge-invariant Higgs potential
V , the set of absolute minima Fmin is necessarily a union of orbits. Thus, we are rather
dealing with a variational problem on the orbit space F/G. If we want to depart from
a concrete model, we should allow V to be an arbitrary gauge invariant function
on F or, equivalently, a function on F/G. Thus, the appropriate mathematical tools

for the discussion of our variational problem are the theory of Lie group actions as
developed in Chap.6 of Part I and, in close relation, the classical invariant theory,
see [301, 523, 570, 571].
Thus, let G be a compact, connected Lie group and let (F, G, σ) be a real rep-
resentation which is orthogonal with respect to a chosen scalar product h. Consider
an orbit type [H] of σ and the corresponding stratum F[H] ⊂F.12 Let f ∈F[H], let
Gf = H be its stabilizer and let G · f be the orbit through f . Since G is compact,
there exists a tubular neighbourhood of G · f . Let Nf be the corresponding (linear)
slice through f , see Sect.6.4 of Part I. Recall that H acts orthogonally and reducibly
on Tf F. The subspaces Tf (G · f ), Tf F[H] and Nf are invariant under this action. By
the results of Sect.6.6 of Part I, we have the orthogonal direct sum decomposition
Tf F = Tf (G · f ) ⊕Nf .
Moreover, deﬁning N0
f := Nf ∩Tf F[H] and N1
f :=

Tf F[H]
⊥⊂Nf , we obtain the
following direct sum decompositions
Tf F = Tf (G · f ) ⊕N0
f ⊕N1
f ,
Tf F[H] = Tf (G · f ) ⊕N0
f .
(7.3.10)
Note that N0
f is the maximal subspace of Nf where H acts trivially. This means, in
particular, that under the canonical projection F →F/G, it is identiﬁed with the
tangent space to the [H]-stratum of the orbit space. Also note the following.
(a) For the principal stratum we have N1
f = 0.
(b) If N0
f = 0, the orbit G · f is isolated in its stratum, that is, there exists a G-
invariant neighbourhood U of G · f which contains no other orbit of the same
type.
Next, let us consider the algebra C∞(F)G of G-invariant functions on F. Since the
representation σ is real, we can identify F with a ﬁnite dimensional Euclidean space
and G withasubgroupoftheorthogonalgroup.Inthissituation,theclassicalinvariant
theory is directly applicable: the ring PG(F) of G-invariant polynomial functions on
F is ﬁnitely generated and any set of generators ρ1, . . . , ρp deﬁnes a mapping
ρ = (ρ1, . . . , ρp) : F/G →Rp ,
which is a homeomorphism onto its image. By [570], any element of C∞(F)G can
be presented as a smooth function of the generators ρ1, . . . , ρp. This implies that any
set of generators separates orbits, that is, any such set may be used to parameterize
the points of the orbit space F/G. In general, the generators ρi fulﬁl a number of
equations and inequalities keeping track of their ranges. Thus, the image S of ρ is
12For simplicity, assume that F[H] is connected. Otherwise, we would have to introduce a second
index labeling the connected components, see Chap.6 of Part I.

a closed semialgebraic variety of Rp. Moreover, ρ maps the connected components
of the strata of F/G bijectively onto the primary strata13 of the variety S .
The set {ρ1, . . . , ρp} and the mapping ρ are called a Hilbert basis and a Hilbert
mapping for σ, respectively. One says that an orbit O of σ is critical if any G-invariant
function is stationary on O. The following theorem was shown in [443].
Theorem 7.3.8 (Michel) Under the above assumptions, an orbit is critical for σ iff
it is isolated in its stratum.
Proof Let f0 be a point in the orbit under consideration and let V ∈C∞(F)G. Since
V and h are G-invariant, the gradient vector ﬁeld ∇V = h−1(dV ) is invariant, too.
Moreover, it must be orthogonal to G · f0 at every point f ∈G · f0. On the other
hand, by the discussion in Sect.6.7 of Part I, the ﬂow of any invariant vector ﬁeld
leaves the strata invariant and, thus, (∇V )f ∈Tf F[H] for any f ∈G · f0. Thus,
(∇V )f ∈N0
f . Consequently, if N0
f = 0, then (dV )(f ) = 0 for any V ∈C∞(F)G and
every f ∈G · f0.
Conversely, let G ·f0 be a critical orbit, that is, (dV )(f ) = 0 for any V ∈C∞(F)G
and every f ∈G · f0. It was shown in [557] that the subspace N0
f is spanned by the
gradients of elements of the Hilbert basis. If they all vanish, then clearly N0
f = 0. ■
From the above proof, we note the following basic facts:
(a) For every V ∈C∞(F)G, we have (∇V )f ∈N0
f .
(b) N0
f is spanned by the gradients of the elements of a Hilbert basis.
These observations can be taken as a starting point for a general model-independent
analysis of the variational problem under consideration. For a given stratum, one has
to determine those generators which are functionally independent on that stratum.
Next, their gradients may be used as a basis of N0
f and, then, the gradient of any
G-invariant function may be expanded in this basis. Now, the equation ∇V = 0 may
be analyzed in terms of the coefﬁcient functions with respect to the chosen basis.
Finally, the Hessian has to be studied as well. For a detailed analysis of this approach
we refer to [6, 558].
Remark 7.3.9 If the potential V depends on a number of parameters, the location
of the stationary points of V will in general depend on these parameters. Varying
their values may result in shifting the absolute minimum to a different stratum, thus
leading to a different residual symmetry. This gives rise to bifurcation phenomena
which, together with the related phase transitions of the physical states, may also be
discussed using the above described framework. For a nice illustration, see Example
1 in Sect.5.4 of Ref. [558].
♦
13See [668, 669] or [571] for this notion. In short, a primary stratiﬁcation of S is a locally ﬁnite
collection Ei of connected semi-analytic submanifolds of Rp, called strata, such that S = ∪iEi and
such that, for each i, Ei \ Ei is a union of lower-dimensional strata.

Magnetic Monopoles
In this section, we take up the discussion from Sect.7.2. First, we recall the clas-
sical Dirac monopole and, next, we consider the non-Abelian model of Georgi and
Glashow introduced in Example 7.3.7 in detail. We discuss the following points:
(a) the identiﬁcation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,
(b) the local characterization in terms of the Poincaré-Hopf index and the global
magnetic charge conservation law,
(c) the charge quantization,
(d) the search for exact ﬁnite energy solutions exhibiting a magnetic monopole.
First, to recall the classical Dirac monopole, consider a static electromagnetic ﬁeld
in the absence of a magnetic current. Then, the Maxwell equations14 read
∇· D = 4πρ
,
∇· B = 0
(7.4.1)
∇× E = 0 ,
∇× H = 0 .
(7.4.2)
In an attempt to reconcile magnetically charged particles with quantum mechanics,
Dirac [153, 154] considered an electron in the ﬁeld of a magnetic charge. Postulating
the single-valuedness of the wave function, he found that the electric and the mag-
netic charges must be related by a certain quantization condition, see below. Thus, if a
magnetic monopole existed, this would explain the quantization of electric charge.15
In the presence of a hypothetical single monopole of strength g, the second equa-
tion in (7.4.1) takes the form
∇· B = 4πgδ3(x) ,
(7.4.3)
where gδ3(x) stands for the magnetic monopole charge density. For the boundary
condition B(x) →0 as ∥x∥→∞, the unique solution to this equation reads
B(x) = g
x
∥x∥3 .
(7.4.4)
By the Gauß law, the magnetic ﬂux of this ﬁeld through the surface S2 of a ball
centered at zero is equal to the magnetic charge Qm inside the ball,

S2 B · dS = Qm .
Consider the restriction of the solution (7.4.4) to S2 = {x ∈R3 : ∥x∥= 1}:
14In the CGS-system.
15For a number of interesting historical references considering the possibility of magnetic
monopoles we refer to [112]. The list provided in this paper dates back to the letter of Petrus
Peregrinus from 1269.

B↾S2 (x) = g x .
(7.4.5)
Note that it is well deﬁned on all of S2. Thus, it deﬁnes a smooth 2-form F =
(B⌟vR3)↾S2 on S2. In spherical coordinates, we have16
B↾S2 (x) = g (cos ϕ sin θ , sin ϕ sin θ , cos θ)
(7.4.6)
and, thus,
F = −g d (cos θ) ∧dϕ .
(7.4.7)
This entails
Qm =

S2 F = 4πg .
(7.4.8)
Since in this discussion the physical constants play a crucial role, we switch over to
the physical representation F 
→ie
ℏcF, see Remark 6.1.1.
Let us now make the following natural assumption: ie
ℏcF is the representative of
the curvature of a connection form on a principal U(1)-bundle P over S2. Then,
the ﬁrst Chern class of P (which, by Theorem 4.8.1, determines P uniquely up to
isomorphisms) is
c1(P) = −1
2πi
ie
ℏcF = −
e
2πℏcF
and, thus, the ﬁrst Chern index reads
c1(P) =

S2 c1(P) = −2eg
ℏc .
(7.4.9)
Since the ﬁrst Chern index is integer-valued, we obtain the following quantization
condition:
2eg
ℏc = m ∈Z .
(7.4.10)
This is the famous Dirac quantization condition. Dirac obtained it by the require-
ment that the electron wave function be single-valued. We see that, equivalently, it
follows from the above requirement that ie
ℏcF be the representative of the curvature
of a connection form on a principal U(1)-bundle over S2. This becomes even more
transparent by the following.
Remark 7.4.1 Note that
A+ = g(1 −cos ϑ) dϕ
and A−= −g(1 + cos ϑ) dϕ
(7.4.11)
are potentials for F on S2 \ {−e0} and S2 \ {e0}, respectively. Thus,
16Everywhere, except for the north and the south poles e0 and −e0, respectively.

, that is, by restriction to the equator S1 ⊂S2 we obtain a
mapping
ρ : S1 →U(1) ∼= S1 ,
ρ(ϕ) = e2igϕ ,
or, in the physical representation, using the quantization condition,
ρ(ϕ) = ei 2eg
ℏc ϕ = eimϕ .
We see that the quantization condition ensures that this function is single-valued and,
thus, it may be viewed as a transition function of a principal U(1)-bundle. It then
deﬁnes transition functions in all associated bundles, in particular, in the complex
line bundle whose sections model the electron wave function. Clearly, for m = 1,
this line bundle is associated with the complex Hopf bundle of Example 1.1.20. It
is easy to check that in that case the connection form deﬁned by (7.4.11) coincides
with the canonical connection (1.3.20) (Exercise 7.4.1).
Finally, note that m coincides with the mapping degree of ρ and that there is a
similar relation to the Chern index as in Proposition 6.3.4.
♦
Now, let us consider the Georgi-Glashow model introduced in Example 7.3.7. We
use the same notation and, in particular, we use the identiﬁcation given by (7.3.6). Let
(ω, Φ) be a conﬁguration of this model, let ˜Φ be the equivariant mapping associated
with Φ and let (A, ϕ) be a (global) representative of this conﬁguration. We deﬁne
Γ := {x ∈M : Φ(x) = 0} ,
M0 := M \ Γ .
(7.4.12)
Recall that M is the 4-dimensional Minkowski space and that Φ takes values in R3.
Thus, generically, Γ is a 1-dimensional submanifold of M. Let us assume that Γ
consists of a union of (disjoint) curves each of which intersects every hypersurface
in M deﬁned by x0 = const. exactly once. Such a submanifold Γ will be called
generic. Below, only this case will be considered.
Let us denote the restrictions of the bundles P and E to M0 ⊂M by P0 and E0,
respectively. Since P and E are trivial, P0 and E0 are trivial, too. The corresponding
restriction of (ω, Φ) will be denoted by the same symbols. Consider the mapping
ˆΦ : P0 →S2 ⊂R3 ,
ˆΦ := ˜Φ · ∥˜Φ∥−1 .
(7.4.13)
By deﬁnition, ˆΦ is G-equivariant and, thus, deﬁnes a section of the subbundle ˆE0 =
P0 ×SO(3) S2 of E0. Note that ˆΦ induces a decomposition of ω on P0:
ω = ω∥+ ω⊥,
ω∥= ˆΦ( ˆΦ · ω) ,
ω⊥= ω −ˆΦ( ˆΦ · ω) ,
(7.4.14)

574
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
where · denotes the Euclidean scalar product on R3.17 Clearly, ˆΦ · ω⊥= 0.
Let us calculate the projection of the curvature of ω to ˆΦ.
Lemma 7.4.2 For any conﬁguration (ω, Φ) on P0, the following identity holds:
ˆΦ · Ω = d( ˆΦ · ω) −1
2
ˆΦ · [d ˆΦ, d ˆΦ] + 1
2
ˆΦ · [D ˆΦ, D ˆΦ] ,
(7.4.15)
where Ω is the curvature form of ω.
Below, depending on whether ω and ˆΦ are viewed as mappings with values in so(3)
or R3, respectively, the bracket [·, ·] denotes either the commutator in so(3) or the
cross product in R3.
Proof Since D ˆΦ = d ˆΦ + [ω, ˆΦ], we have
[ ˆΦ, D ˆΦ −d ˆΦ] = [ ˆΦ, [ω, ˆΦ]]
= [ ˆΦ, [ω −ˆΦ( ˆΦ · ω), ˆΦ] + [ ˆΦ( ˆΦ · ω), ˆΦ]]
= [ ˆΦ, [ω⊥, ˆΦ]]
= ω⊥( ˆΦ · ˆΦ) −ˆΦ( ˆΦ · ω⊥) ,
that is,
ω⊥= [ ˆΦ, D ˆΦ −d ˆΦ] .
On the other hand, using the standard basis {ea} in so(3) ∼= R3, we calculate
[D ˆΦ −d ˆΦ, D ˆΦ −d ˆΦ] = [[ω, ˆΦ], [ω, ˆΦ]]
= eaεa

Thus,
ˆΦ · [ω, ω] = ˆΦ · [D ˆΦ −d ˆΦ, D ˆΦ −d ˆΦ] ,
and, therefore, using d ˆΦ · ˆΦ = 0, we obtain
17It coincides, up to a factor 1
2, with the negative Killing form of so(3).

d( ˆΦ · ω) −1
2
ˆΦ · [d ˆΦ, d ˆΦ] = ˆΦ · Ω −1
2
ˆΦ · [D ˆΦ, D ˆΦ] .
(7.4.16)
The gauge invariant 2-form
Fem := ˆΦ · Ω −1
2
ˆΦ · [D ˆΦ, D ˆΦ]
(7.4.17)
is called the 't Hooft electromagnetic ﬁeld strength [623]. A priori, this is a 2-form on
the (trivial) bundle P0, but, since both Ω and D ˆΦ may be viewed as 2-forms on M0
with values in the adjoint bundle, Fem may be viewed as an R-valued 2-form on M0.
Note that, separately, the two summands on the left hand side of (7.4.16) are neither
gauge invariant, nor may they be interpreted as 2-forms on M0. But, clearly, their sum
must be a gauge invariant 2-form on M0, too, and thus for any global representative
(A, ˆϕ) of (ω, ˆΦ) on M0, we have
Fem = d( ˆϕ · A) −1
2 ˆϕ · [d ˆϕ, d ˆϕ] .
(7.4.18)
To justify the name for Fem, we ﬁrst show the following.

576
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
Proposition 7.4.3 The 2-form Fem is closed,
dFem = 0 .
(7.4.19)
Proof By (7.4.18), we must prove that d

ˆϕ · [d ˆϕ, d ˆϕ]

= 0. Since ˆϕ2 = 1, we have
ˆϕ · d ˆϕ = 0. Thus, for any vector X ∈TxM0, the vector d ˆϕ(X) ∈R3 lies in the plane
orthogonal to ˆϕ(x). Consequently, the vector [d ˆϕ(Y), d ˆϕ(Z)] is parallel to ˆϕ(x), for
any pair of tangent vectors Y, Z ∈TxM0. This implies d ˆϕ(X) · [d ˆϕ(Y), d ˆϕ(Z)] = 0
for any triple of tangent vectors. Thus d ˆϕ
.∧[d ˆϕ, d ˆϕ] vanishes identically. This
yields the assertion.
■
Now, choose a hypersurface Σ0 := {x ∈M : x0 = const.}. Assume that the
submanifold Γ given by (7.4.12) is generic. Label the curves constituting Γ by Γi.
By assumption, each Γi intersects Σ0 in an isolated point xi. Take a family of open
balls Ki of radius εi centered at xi and consider a 'big' open ball KR of radius R in
Σ0 containing all Ki. Denote the boundary 2-spheres by S2
i and S2
R, respectively, and
choose on each of these spheres the orientation pointing outwards. By the Theorem
of Stokes and by Proposition 7.4.3, the total magnetic charge contained in KR is given

To calculate the ﬂux of F, we must study the behaviour of the second term on the
right hand side of (7.4.18). Let S2
ε be a 2-sphere of radius ε which is not contractible
in M0 and consider the mapping
ψ := ˆϕ↾S2ε : S2

to the reader (Exercise 7.4.2).

■
Remark 7.4.6
1. Since the mapping degree is a homotopy invariant, the mapping ψ deﬁnes an
element of the second homotopy group π2(S2). Viewing S2 ⊂R3 as the homoge-
neous space G/H, with G = SO(3) and H = SO(2), we recover the topological
characterization of ϕ in terms of an element [ϕ∞] ∈π2(G/H) found in Sect.7.2.
The degree of the mapping ψi : S2
i →S2 is often called the Poincaré-Hopf index
of the zero xi. For a detailed discussion of the various equivalent topological
characterizations we refer to [20].
2. Since Φ vanishes on Γ , Fem is singular on Γ and thus cannot be continuously
extended to the whole of M. Nonetheless, we may consider the 3-form [20]
jm := dFem
(7.4.25)
on M in the sense of distributions. Since on M0 we have dFem = 0, jm has
obviously support on Γ . The distribution-valued 3-form jm is called the magnetic
current form. By (7.4.18),
jm = −1
2d ˆϕ
.∧[d ˆϕ, d ˆϕ] .

In terms of jm, the magnetic charge contained in KR is given by

Since, by deﬁnition, jm fulﬁls the continuity equation d jm = 0 , the magnetic
charge is conserved.18

⎦.
1. Let
(ϕ1 + iϕ2)(x) = (ax1 + ibx2)n ,
ϕ3(x) = cx3 ,
a, b, c ∈R .
One can show that ϕ carries a magnetic monopole of strength n (Exercise 7.4.3).
2. Let
ϕ1(x) = 2ax1f (x) ,
ϕ2(x) = 2ax2f (x) ,
ϕ3(x) = (∥x∥2 −a2)f (x) ,
where a ∈R and f is a nowhere vanishing smooth function. One can show that
ϕ carries two monopoles with opposite strengths ±1 separated by a distance 2a
(Exercise 7.4.3).
♦
The above analysis shows that the information about the magnetic charges is encoded
in the topological behaviour of the Higgs ﬁeld. Since ˆϕ is deﬁned everywhere on
M0, one often speaks of a description in a non-singular gauge. Next, let us present
an alternative picture. Choose a point ˆΦ0 ∈S2. Let H ∼= SO(2) be the stabilizer of
ˆΦ0 and let Q0 be the reduction of P0 to H induced by ˆΦ0. Then,
Q0 = {p ∈P0 : ˆΦ(p) = ˆΦ0} .
Let i0 : Q0 →P0 be the natural inclusion mapping. Then, as in the proof of Propo-
sition 7.3.4, pulling back ω to Q0 via i0 and decomposing it with respect to (7.3.9),
we obtain
ˆω0 := i∗
0ωh ,
ˆτ0 := i∗
0ωm ,
(7.4.27)
where ˆω0 is an so(2) ∼= R-valued connection form and ˆτ0 is a horizontal 1-form
of type Ad(H)m on Q0. Next, let us see what becomes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
strength Fem given by (7.4.17). For that purpose, we take the pullback of the identity
(7.4.16) to Q0 under the inclusion mapping i0. Comparing with (7.4.14), we have
i∗
0 (ω∥) = ˆω0 .
(7.4.28)
Using this, together with i∗
0 (d ˆΦ) = d ˆΦ0 = 0, from (7.4.16) we read off
Fem = d( ˆΦ0 · ω) = d ˆω0 = ˆΩ0 ,
(7.4.29)
that is, Fem coincides with the curvature of the reduced connection form on Q0. Now,
Proposition 7.4.5 immediately implies the following.19
19Here, we view Q0 as a principal U(1)-bundle.

This observation should be compared with an analogous result in the theory of in-
stantons, see Proposition 6.3.4. In this picture, the magnetic charges are encoded in
the nontrivial topology of the reduced bundle Q0. Now, instead of the global formula
(7.4.18), we obtain20
Fem = dA ,
with A being a local representative of ˆω0. Clearly, if Q0 is nontrivial no global
representative exists. In other words, if one insisted in working with a single poten-
tial, it would necessarily have singularities. Therefore, one sometimes calls this the
description in a singular gauge, where the magnetic monopoles are carried by the
singularities of A.

We still stick to the model under consideration and look for an exact static solution
of the ﬁeld equations exhibiting a magnetic monopole with ﬁnite energy. By the
results of Sect.7.2, ﬁnite energy conﬁgurations (A, ϕ) are labelled by elements of
π2(G/H), where H is the residual gauge group after symmetry breaking, and asymp-
totic solutions are characterized by the charge 2Q ∈h, where h is the Lie algebra of
H, cf. Theorem 7.2.12 and Remark 7.2.13. Explicitly, in spherical coordinates, the
asymptotic solutions read
Aϑ = 0 ,
Aφ = ±(1 ∓cos ϑ)Q .
20Note that Fem may still be viewed as a 2-form on M0, because the adjoint bundle of a principal
U(1)-bundle is necessarily trivial.

They are of course supplemented by an appropriate fall-off law of ϕ for ∥x∥→∞.
As noted before, these solutions are spherically symmetric.
Here, we have H = SO(2) and, thus, 2Q is simply an integer 2c ∈Z, cf. point
1 of the proof of Theorem 7.2.12. Then, (7.4.24), (7.4.30) and (7.2.40) imply the

For the model under consideration, the above asymptotic solutions were ﬁrst found by
't Hooft [623] and Polyakov [514]. Therefore, they are called the 't Hooft-Polyakov
monopole solutions. In [623] also the energy functional was analyzed in detail, and
the mass of the magnetic monopole was calculated. Given these asymptotic solutions,
one may wish to extend them to ﬁnite energy solutions on all of R3. This is a very
complicated task even for the model under consideration. It was Schwarz [566] who
gave a rigorous proof that, for this model, an exact solution fulﬁlling the imposed
boundary conditions exists. However, it is impossible to express this solution in terms
of elementary functions. Its numerical behaviour is as follows:
ϕa(x) = xa

Here, η is the Higgs vacuum and H und K are functions whose qualitative behaviour

comments and references. For a status report concerning the experimental search for
magnetic monopoles we refer to [71].

Now, let us try to ﬁnd the absolute minima of the energy functional E(ω, Φ) of a

This inequality is called the Bogomolnyi bound [84]. It is the starting point for the

absolute minimum of the energy functional if this bound is saturated, that is, if
V (Φ) = 0 ,
Ωm = ±DΦ .

(7.5.6)
for ∥x∥→∞. This may be viewed as a relic of the Higgs potential. The limit
V →0 is often referred to as the Prasad-Sommerﬁeld limit [522]. Clearly, for
analytical estimates, these requirements must be made more precise [610]. E.g., the
ﬁrst condition in (7.5.5) should be formulated as follows: for some δ > 0,
∥x∥1+δ|DΦ| ≤const.

Thus, in the Prasad-Sommerﬁeld limit, the energy functional of the Georgi-Glashow
model is bounded from below by the total magnetic charge.
♦
Now, consider the ﬁeld equations(7.2.14) on Σ0 = R3. In the adjoint representation
and, under the assumption that V = 0, they read
∗dωΩm = [DΦ, Φ] ,
D∗◦DΦ = 0 .
(7.5.9)
Correspondingly, the Bianchi identities (7.2.6) take the form (Exercise 7.5.1)
dω ∗Ωm = 0 ,
D ◦DΦ = [∗Ωm, Φ] .
(7.5.10)
If we now require the second equation in (7.5.4) to hold,
Ωm = ±DΦ ,
(7.5.11)
we see that the ﬁeld equations(7.5.9) reduce to the Bianchi identities (7.5.10). Thus,
any exact solution of (7.5.11) entails an exact solution of the Yang-Mills-Higgs
system in the Prasad-Sommerﬁeld limit. Equation(7.5.11) is called the Bogomolnyi
equation.

7.5 The Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld Model
583
Let us study this equation. By the above discussion, any solution of this equation
yields an absolute minimum of the energy functional. Consider the decomposition
of the Euclidean space
R4 = Re0 × R3
(7.5.12)
and write pri , i = 1, 2 , for the canonical projections onto the ﬁrst and the second
component of (7.5.12), respectively. For ˜x ∈R4, denote pr1(˜x) = x0 and pr2(˜x) = x.
In this notation, the action of the Abelian group R by translations on the ﬁrst factor
is given by
δ : R × R4 →R4 ,
δ(s, (x0, x)) = (x0 + s, x) .
Proposition 7.5.2 Solutions to the Bogomolnyi equation are in bijective correspon-
dence with (anti-)self-dual, R-invariant connections on the Euclidean space R4.
Proof Let (ω, Φ) be a solution of the Bogomolnyi equation, where ω is a connection
form on a principal G-bundle π : P →R3 and Φ is a section of Ad(P). Since P is
(necessarily) trivial, the pullback bundle ˜P = pr∗
2 P over R4 is also trivial and thus,
as a manifold, diffeomorphic to R × P, with the diffeomorphism given by
χ : R × (R3 × G) →˜P ,
χ

x0, (x, g)

:=

(x0, x), (x, g)

.
Note that pr2(x0, x) = π(x, g), indeed. Under this identiﬁcation, ˜P carries a natural
lift Δ of the R-action δ, given by translations on the R-component.
Now,wemayapplythetheoryofinvariantconnectionsfromSect.1.9.ByExample
1.9.18, principal G-bundles over R4 admitting a lift of the action δ have the form23
˜P = R × P and R-invariant connections ˜ω on ˜P are in one-to-one correspondence
with pairs (ω, Φ) where ω is a connection form on P and Φ ∈Γ ∞(Ad(P)). It
remains to show that (ω, Φ) is a solution of the Bogomolnyi equation iff ˜ω is
(anti-)self-dual. As in Example 1.9.18, we extend Φ ⊗e0∗to a 1-form on Re0 with
values in Γ ∞(Ad(P)) via the R-action and use the natural isomorphism
Ω1(R4, Ad(P)) ∼= Ω1
Ad,hor( ˜P, g) ,
to obtain a horizontal 1-form ˜τ of type Ad on ˜P. Under this identiﬁcation,
˜ω = ω + ˜τ .
(7.5.13)
Since the bundles P and ˜P are trivial we can use global representatives (A, ϕ) of
(ω, Φ) and ˜A of ˜ω, respectively. Denote the representatives of the curvature forms
of ω and ˜ω by F and ˜F, respectively. Then, by (7.5.13),
˜A = A + ϕdx0
23Note that the roles of P and ˜P are interchanged here.

and, thus, by the Structure Equation,
˜F = F + Dϕ ∧dx0 .
Let B be the (global) representative of Ωm. Then, by (7.2.12), F = ∗R3B and, using
∗R4(α ∧dx0) = −∗R3 α, for any 1-form α on R3 we calculate

The reader can check by a straightforward calculation that this a solution of the

and Sommerﬁeld [522].
♦
Remark 7.5.4
1. It was a challenge to ﬁnd monopole solutions of higher charge. The ﬁrst exis-
tence proof was presented by Taubes [609, 617]. His method is based on the
idea that a charge k monopole should be obtained by gluing together k charge 1
monopoles. However, to ﬁnd explicit solutions, other techniques had to be devel-
oped. The correspondence established in Proposition 7.5.2 suggests that methods
from the theory of instantons should be applicable. Indeed, the same sequence of
ansätze from [42] led to the construction of multi monopole solutions with gauge
group SU(2), see [139, 520, 521, 650, 651]. Hitchin [306] proved that all SU(2)
monopoles can be obtained this way. A different approach, also related to in-
stanton theory, is due to Nahm [469-471]. He developed an inﬁnite-dimensional
version of the ADHM construction to obtain multi monopole solutions. Next, it
was again Hitchin [307] who proved that, via the Nahm construction, all SU(2)-
monopoles are obtained. This way, an equivalence between the two approaches
was established. Later, Hurtubise and Murray [334] extended this result to the
case of arbitrary classical groups.

7.5 The Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld Model
585
2. As in the case of instantons, it is interesting to study the moduli space Mk of
charge k monopole solutions. For G = SU(2), this problem has been solved by
Donaldson [158]. He has proved that Mk ∼= Rk/ ∼, where Rk is the complex
manifold of rational functions f of degree k on the Riemann sphere CP1 =
C ∪{∞} fulﬁlling f (∞) = 0, and ∼denotes factorization with respect to the
circle action f 
→eiϑf . The proof of this statement is based on the variant of the
ADHM construction of Nahm cited above. Given the above isomorphism, one
gains a nice intuitive picture of how a general solution looks like: an arbitrary
element of Rk is given by
f (z) =
k

i=1
ai
z −zi
,
ai ∈C .
In particular, we read off that dim(Mk) = 4k −1. Thus, for k = 1, we obtain
a 3-dimensional moduli space. In the parameterization of Example 7.5.3, any
solution is obtained from the BPS monopole via a translation x 
→x −x0.
Following the ideas developed by Donaldson and using the results of [334],
Hurtubise [333] has found the moduli spaces for arbitrary classical groups SU(n),
SO(n) and Sp(n). In all cases, the moduli spaces are equivalent to spaces of
holomorphic mappings from CP1 into ﬂag manifolds. In [36], the dynamics of
monopoles has been studied in terms of geodesic motion on the moduli space.
This goes back to an idea of Manton [425], who suggested that the geodesics of
the metric on the moduli space should correspond to scattering of slowly moving
monopoles. If one takes this idea seriously, one should study the metric of the
moduli space. This has been done for SU(2)-monopoles with special symmetries,
see [317, 318] and further references therein, and in special cases also for other
gauge groups, see [463] and references therein.
3. In [31], Atiyah proposed to study the Bogomolnyi equation on the hyperbolic
3-space. He showed that hyperbolic monopoles may be regarded as S1-invariant
instantons on S4. This variant of the theory is still an active ﬁeld of research. In
[464, 465], the twistor approach to this theory has been worked out. Moreover,
there is a large number of attempts to construct (or prove the existence of) so-
lutions, see [426, 586, 606] and further references therein. The geometry of the
corresponding moduli space has not been clariﬁed up until now, see [481], [482]
for attempts in this direction.
4. By the above discussion, the critical set of absolute minima of the Yang-Mills-
Higgs action functional consists of the solutions to the Bogomolnyi equation.
It was shown by Taubes that there exist smooth, ﬁnite action solutions to the
SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs equations in the Prasad-Sommerﬁeld limit which do
not satisfy the Bogomolnyi equation. In [614], Taubes proved that they are all
unstable. It is interesting to ask whether such non-minimal solutions exist if
one requires spherical symmetry. For the case of SU(2), the answer is negative
[419]. If one allows for gauge groups with rank larger than 2, then such solutions
exist [111].

The Seiberg-Witten Model
In 1994, Seiberg and Witten published two papers where they studied the vacuum
structure of N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [576, 577]. In this context,
theyfoundanAbeliangaugemodelcoupledtoaspinorﬁeldwhich,accordingtosome
heuristic arguments taken from quantum ﬁeld theory, had to contain the same topo-
logical information as the Yang-Mills theory [675].24 Indeed, within a few months,
many of the results obtained via instanton theory, were re-proved within the new
theory. In this section, we give an introduction to this fascinating model. By now,
there exists a considerable textbook literature on the subject, see [180, 219, 428, 459,
460, 487, 553], to which we refer for an exhaustive presentation.
Consider an oriented compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g) car-
rying a Spinc-structure Sc(M). Let π : P →M be the corresponding fundamental
U(1)-bundle and let L be the associated determinant line bundle given by (5.4.11).
Let ω be the Levi-Civita connection on O+(M) and let τ be a connection on P. Via
the two-fold covering Sc(M) →O+(E) ×M P, these connections deﬁne a unique
connection ωτ on Sc(M). Let Ωτ = dτ ∈Ω2(M)⊗iR be the curvature25 of τ and let
S c(M) = Sc(M) ×Spinc(4) Δ4
be the associated canonical spinor bundle26 endowed with the Dirac operator Dτ
deﬁned by ωτ. By Remark 5.5.6, we have the natural splitting
24Roughly speaking, according to Witten the two theories should be viewed as two different asymp-
totic limits of a single theory which are getting interchanged via S-duality. Under this symmetry,
electrically charged states are exchanged with magnetic monopoles, see Remark 7.6.7 below. Up
to our knowledge, these quantum ﬁeld theoretic arguments have never been made mathematically
precise up until now, but there exists a research programme for accomplishing this goal, see [428]
for a further discussion.

the presentation given by (5.1.26), for the generators of S2Δ+

e1e2 + e3e4 = 2iσ1 ,
e1e3 + e4e2 = 2iσ2 ,

of real-valued self-dual forms on R4 with the space of traceless skew-Hermitean
endomorphisms of Δ+
4 . Complexifying these isomorphisms, in particular, we ob-
tain an identiﬁcation of imaginary-valued self-dual forms with traceless Hermitean
endomorphisms. Passing to the bundle level, we obtain natural bundle isomorphisms

where T ∗denotes the adjoint endomorphism, ⟨T ∗w, v⟩= ⟨w, Tv⟩. Now, let α =
 
i<j αijϑi ∧ϑj ∈Ω2(M, C). Using the quantization mapping c, we calculate
27Here, we use the convention that the Hermitean scalar product is anti-linear in the ﬁrst and linear
in the second entry.

On the other hand, decomposing q(Φ) deﬁned by (7.6.8) with respect to the basis

Now, the conﬁguration space of the Seiberg-Witten model is deﬁned as
C = A (P) × Γ ∞(S c
+(M)) ,
(7.6.12)
where A (P) is the afﬁne space of connections on P. Thus, C is an afﬁne space
consisting of pairs (τ, Φ). We stress that the metric g is kept ﬁxed. In a similar way
as explained in Sect.6.1, C may be treated in a Sobolev space setting, see [487, 553]
for details. Clearly, C is acted upon by the group G of local gauge transformations.
Here, the general transformation laws given by (6.1.2) and (7.1.6) boil down to
(τ, Φ) 
→(τ + π∗(2ρ−1dρ), ρ−1Φ) ,
(7.6.13)
where ρ : M →U(1). The action of the Seiberg-Witten model, called the Seiberg-
Witten functional, is deﬁned by

Proposition 7.6.4 implies the following.
Corollary 7.6.5 The absolute minima of the Seiberg-Witten functional are deter-
mined by the equations
DτΦ = 0 ,
Ω+
τ = βΦ .
(7.6.17)
■
The Eq.(7.6.17) will be referred to as the Seiberg-Witten equations. Equivalently,
by (7.6.11), they may be written as
DτΦ = 0 ,
c(Ω+
τ ) = −q(Φ) .
(7.6.18)
Remark 7.6.6 (Gauge transformations)
1. Consider a gauge transformation (7.6.13) of a solution (τ, Φ) to the Seiberg-
Witten equations. From Proposition 6.2.7 we know that (anti-)self-duality of a
connection is a property which is invariant under gauge transformations. Here,
the situation is even simpler, because in the Abelian case the curvature is gauge
invariant. The same is true for q(Φ). Moreover, the Dirac operator clearly trans-
forms in the same way as Φ itself,
DτΦ 
→ρ−1DτΦ .
We conclude that the gauge transformed conﬁguration (τ +π∗(2ρ−1dρ), ρ−1Φ)
is a solution of the Seiberg-Witten equations as well.
2. Using elliptic regularity, the following can be shown. If (τ, Φ) is a solution to the
Seiberg-Witten equations belonging to an appropriate Sobolev class, then there
exists a gauge transformation such that the gauge transformed conﬁguration is
smooth and thus, by point 1, a smooth solution, see Theorem 7.11 in [553] for
details.
♦
Remark 7.6.7 (Seiberg-Witten equations and magnetic monopoles) By the discus-
sion in Sects.7.4 and 7.5, given a solution (τ, Φ) of (7.6.17) corresponding to a
nontrivial ﬁrst Chern class of P, τ describes a magnetic monopole conﬁguration.
Therefore, the Seiberg-Witten equations are also called monopole equations. To
make the relation to our previous discussion more transparent, let us consider the
Seiberg-Witten equations on Minkowski space, see [215, 467]. In that case, the ﬁrst
of the equations(7.6.17) is the ordinary Dirac equation known from relativistic quan-
tum mechanics for a spin 1
2 massless particle, coupled to the electromagnetic ﬁeld,
and the second of the equations(7.6.17) puts some conditions on the electromagnetic
ﬁeld strength tensor. It is easy to check (Exercise 7.6.3) that one has the following
(static) exact solution of (7.6.17):
A0 = 0 ,
Ak(x, y, z) = (−iy, ix, 0)
2r(r −z) ,
(7.6.19)

592
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
Φ(x, y, z) =
1
√2r(r −z)
x −iy
r −z

.
(7.6.20)
Here, (x, y, z) are the standard coordinates on R3, r2 = x2 + y2 + z2 and A is
a potential of Ω+
τ . Clearly, A describes a magnetic monopole of Dirac type. As
expected, calculating the right hand side of the second equation in (7.6.17) for Φ
given by (7.6.20) shows that the ﬁeld strength tensor is of Coulomb type.
Let us add that the Seiberg-Witten equations can be generalized from U(1) to
SU(n). Then, one also ﬁnds monopole solutions, see [149] for details.
♦
The Lichnerowicz Formula for the Dirac operator implies the following strong a
priori estimate for the matter ﬁeld part of a solution of the Seiberg-Witten equations.
Proposition 7.6.8 Let (M, g) be an oriented compact Riemannian 4-manifold with
scalar curvature Sc, endowed with a Spinc-structure. If (τ, Φ) is a solution to the
Seiberg-Witten equations, then either Φ vanishes identically or, at every point m ∈
M,
|Φ(m)|2 ≤−Scmin ,
(7.6.21)
where Scmin is the minimal value of the scalar curvature on M. In particular, if the
scalar curvature is non-negative, then Φ = 0 identically.
Proof By Corollary 5.6.6, the Lichnerowicz Formula for Dτ reads
D2
τ = ∇∗∇+ 1
4Sc −1
2c(Ωτ) .
(7.6.22)
Thus, for a solution (τ, Φ) of (7.6.18), we have
0 = D2
τΦ = ∇∗∇Φ + 1
4Sc Φ + 1
4|Φ|2Φ .
(7.6.23)

and (7.6.23), we obtain

Now, recall from Chap.6 that the study of the moduli space of instantons yields
deep insight into the differential topology of 4-manifolds. Here, we deal with a similar
situation which, in fact, is much simpler according to the fact that the gauge group
is Abelian.28 Thus, let us consider the moduli space corresponding to the Seiberg-
Witten equations. In complete analogy to (6.5.1), we deﬁne the moduli space as
ML :=

(τ, Φ) ∈C : DτΦ = 0 , Ω+
τ = βΦ
/G .
As already mentioned at the beginning, as in the Yang-Mills case, all the mappings
and spaces involved in the study of ML may be understood within the setting of
Sobolev theory. For a presentation including these analytical details, we refer to
[553] or [487].
To start with, in sharp contrast to the Yang-Mills case, the following holds.
Theorem 7.6.9 The Seiberg-Witten moduli space ML is compact.
For a proof see [393, 553]. The key point is the a priori estimate (7.6.21). Then, by
standard bootstrap-type arguments, the assertion follows. We do not work out these
details here.
Now, to study ML, one can proceed as in the instanton case: one constructs a
local model of the moduli space by linearizing the ﬁeld equations and associates to
that linearization an elliptic complex whose index, calculated by the Index Theorem,
yields minus the (virtual) dimension of the moduli space.
28Of course, the Seiberg-Witten equations are nonlinear as well, but the nonlinearity given by the
quadratic form q(Φ) is much milder than the nonlinearity of the Yang-Mills equation.

Lemma 7.6.10 The linearized Seiberg-Witten equations at the point (τ, Φ) ∈C
have the following form:
(dα)+ = βΦ,φ ,
Dτφ + i
2αΦ = 0 ,
(7.6.24)
with the indeterminates α ∈Ω1(M, iR) and φ ∈Γ ∞(S c

βΦ,φ(X, Y) = i
2 Im {⟨Φ, X · Y · φ⟩−g(X, Y)⟨Φ, φ⟩} .
(7.6.25)
Proof Consider the 1-parameter families τt = τ + tα and Φt = Φ + tφ generated
by (α, φ). Then, Ωτt = dτ + tdα and, thus, d

We obtain an inﬁnitesimal model for the moduli space by factorizing with respect to

(7.6.26)
To summarize, for every solution (τ, Φ) of the Seiberg-Witten equation, we have
constructed two natural operators:
P0
(τ,Φ) : Ω0(M, iR) →Ω1(M, iR) ⊕Γ ∞(S c
+(M))
given by
P0
(τ,Φ)(ξ) := (−2dξ, ξΦ) ,

and
P1
(τ,Φ) : Ω1(M, iR) ⊕Γ ∞(S c

deﬁned by
P1

P1
(τ,Φ)

+(M, iR) ⊕Γ (S c

is an elliptic complex of ﬁrst order differential operators.
Proof We must show that P1
(τ,Φ) ◦P0
(τ,Φ) = 0. Thus, let α = −2dξ and φ = ξΦ.
Then, by (7.6.25), for any X, Y ∈TM,

(X, Y) = −i
2 Im

ξ

⟨Φ, X · Y · Φ⟩−g(X, Y)|Φ|2

because βΦ and ξ are imaginary-valued. Moreover, using an orthonormal local frame

But DτΦ vanishes by (7.6.17). Finally, the complex is elliptic and the operators P1
(τ,Φ)
and P0
(τ,Φ) are Fredholm, because they are built, up to lower-order terms, from the
elliptic differential operators discussed in Examples 5.7.22 and 5.7.23.
■
Let us denote the above elliptic complex by ESW and call it the Seiberg-Witten
complex. In the next step, we have to calculate its index over the reals.
Theorem 7.6.12 The index of the Seiberg-Witten complex is given by
indR(ESW) = −1
4c1(L)2 + 1
4(2χ(M) + 3σ(M)) ,
(7.6.27)
where c1(L) is the ﬁrst Chern index of L and χ(M) and σ(M) are the Euler charac-
teristic and the signature of M, respectively.

596
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
Proof Since lower order terms do not contribute, the index of ESW is equal to the
index of the complex
Ω0(M, iR)
d⊕0
−→Ω1(M, iR) ⊕Γ ∞(S c
+(M))
d+⊕Dτ
−−−→Ω2
+(M, iR) ⊕Γ ∞(S c
−(M)) ,
which we denote by ESW
0 . By (5.7.44), in turn, the index of ESW
0
coincides with minus
the index of the assembled complex
Ω1(M, iR) ⊕Γ ∞(S c
+(M))
(d∗⊕d+⊕Dτ )
−−−−−−−→Ω0(M, iR) ⊕Ω2
+(M, iR) ⊕Γ ∞(S c
−(M)) .
Next, using the additivity of the index, we obtain
−indR(ESW
0 ) = 2 indC(Dτ) + indR(d+ + d∗) .
By (5.8.53), (4.7.15) and (4.7.25), we have
indC Dτ =

Since, by (4.7.11) and the Hirzebruch Theorem 5.9.6, σ(M) = 1
3p1(M), we obtain
indR Dτ = 1
4c1(L)2 −1
4σ(M) .
(7.6.28)
Next, we calculate the index of T = d∗+ d+. For that purpose, we use the Hodge
Theorem 2.7.2 and the remarks thereafter. Let α ∈Ω2(M). Then, α ∈ker(T) iff
d∗α = 0 and d+α = 0. In this case,
(d + d∗)(α + ∗α) = dα + d ∗α = 2d+α = 0 .
Thus, d∗dα = 2d∗d+α = 0. Taking the L2-scalar product of this equation with
α implies dα = 0. We conclude that the kernel of T coincides with the space of
harmonic 1-forms,
ker(T) = H 1(M) = ker(d) ∩ker(d∗) .
Next, we need the adjoint
T ∗: Ω0(M) ⊕Ω2
+(M) →Ω1(M) ,
⟨T ∗(ξ, β), α⟩= ⟨ξ, d∗α⟩+ ⟨β, d+α⟩,
for any α ∈Ω1(M). Thus,
T ∗(ξ, β) = dξ + d∗β .

7.6 The Seiberg-Witten Model
597
Now, (ξ, β) ∈ker(T ∗) iff dξ = 0 and d∗β = 0. But, for a self-dual form β ∈Ω2
+(M)
we have d∗β = 0 iff dβ = 0. Thus, we obtain
ker(T ∗) = H 0(M) ⊕H 2
+ (M) ,
where H 2
+ (M) denotes the space of self-dual harmonic 2-forms on M. To summarize,
we have
ind(T) = dim(ker(T)) −dim(ker(T ∗)) = −b0 + b1 −b+
2 ,
(7.6.29)
with the bi denoting the Betti numbers. Now, by deﬁnition, σ(M) = b+
2 −b−
2 and,
hence, b+
2 = 1
2(b2+σ(M)). Moreover, by Poincaré duality, χ(M) = 2(b0−b1)+b2.
This yields
indR(d∗+ d+) = −1
2(χ(M) + σ(M)) .
(7.6.30)
Adding up (7.6.28) and (7.6.30), we obtain the assertion.
■
Now, H1(ESW) serves as an inﬁnitesimal model for the tangent spaces of ML. Then,
as in the Yang-Mills case, the index of ESW
0
yields the virtual dimension of ML
provided H0(ESW) and H2(ESW) vanish. First, note that the action of G is not free
when Φ = 0. Such conﬁgurations give rise to singular points in the moduli space.
Deﬁnition 7.6.13 A solution (τ, Φ) of the Seiberg-Witten equations is called re-
ducible if Φ = 0. Otherwise it is referred to as irreducible.
By (7.6.13), the stabilizer of a reducible conﬁguration is isomorphic to the subgroup
U(1) ⊂G consisting of the constant mappings. Clearly, if (τ, Φ) is irreducible, then
H0(ESW) vanishes. For later purposes, we also note the following.
Remark 7.6.14 If Φ is a solution to the equation DτΦ = 0 on a connected manifold,
then Φ either vanishes identically, or it is different from zero everywhere on an open
dense subset. This is called the Unique Continuation Theorem, see e.g. Theorem E.8
in [553] for a proof. Thus, for an irreducible conﬁguration (τ, Φ), the matter ﬁeld Φ
is nowhere vanishing on an open dense subset of M.
♦
Now, as in the Yang-Mills case, one would like to be able to perturb the system
in order to achieve transversality, that is, to achieve the vanishing of H0(ESW) and
H2(ESW). Coming from Yang-Mills theory, it would be desirable to do this by
perturbing the metric g and, thus, to obtain a counterpart of the Freed-Uhlenbeck
Theorem, see the discussion in Sect.6.5. Here, the dependence on the metric is,
however, more complicated. The system depends on g not only via the Hodge star
operator but also via the Spinc-structure. This leads to a quite complicated variational
problem, which to our knowledge has not yet been completely understood in the
general case. Sources for this approach are [180, 559]. For a summary of various
perturbations used in various special cases and for yet another perturbation approach,
we refer to [228]. The most convenient and, probably therefore, the most prominent

598
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
perturbation is given in terms of a generic self-dual 2-form η ∈Ω2
+(M, iR). From
now on, let us limit our attention to that case. Instead of (7.6.17), one considers the
perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations
DτΦ = 0 ,
Ω+
τ + η = βΦ .
(7.6.31)
Then, for a reducible solution, we have
Ω+
τ + η = 0 .
(7.6.32)
It turns out that if b+
2 (M) > 0, then for a generic choice of η there are no solutions
to this equation. In more detail, let Ω2,+
c
⊂Ω2
+(M, iR) be the subset of elements η
such that there exists a connection τ ∈A (P) fulﬁlling (7.6.32).
Lemma 7.6.15 Assume that b+
2 (M) > 0. Then, the set Ω2,+
c
is an afﬁne subspace
of Ω2
+(M, iR) of codimension b+
2 (M) whose translation vector space is given by the
image of d+ : Ω1(M, iR) →Ω2
+(M, iR).
Proof First, we show that Ω2,+
c
is an afﬁne subspace with translation vector space
im(d+). For that purpose, let η0 ∈Ω2,+
c
and let τ0 ∈A (P) be a connection such
that Ω+
τ0 + η0 = 0. On the one hand, for any η ∈Ω2,+
c
there exists τ ∈A (P) such
that Ω+
τ + η = 0. Thus, η −η0 = d+(τ0 −τ). On the other hand, if η = η0 + d+α
for some α, then Ω+
τ0−α + η = 0. This implies
Ω2,+
c
= η0 + im(d+) .
It remains to compute the codimension. For that purpose, using Hodge theory, we
prove the following direct sum decomposition:
Ω2
+(M, iR) = H 2
+ (M, iR) ⊕im(d+) .
(7.6.33)
For any η ∈Ω2
+(M, iR), we have η = χ + dα + ∗dβ, where χ is harmonic and
α, β ∈Ω1(M, iR). Thus,
η = ∗η = ∗χ + dβ + ∗dα .
This implies χ = ∗χ and dα = dβ and, thus, η = χ + 2d+α. Since every self-dual
harmonic 2-form is orthogonal to the image of d+, the sum in (7.6.33) is direct.
■
Passing in Eq.(7.6.32) to the de Rham cohomology classes, we obtain
[η] = 2πi c1(L)+ .
(7.6.34)
If this equation holds, then (7.6.32) admits a solution and, in this case, η is said
to be bad (with respect to the chosen Spinc-structure). Otherwise, η is said to be
good. By the above discussion, for b+
2 (M) > 0, the 2-form η is generically good

7.6 The Seiberg-Witten Model
599
and, thus, generically every solution of the Seiberg-Witten equations is irreducible.
Also note that for b+
2 (M) = 0 a reducible solution exists for any metric and for any
perturbation.
Now, consider the mapping
F : A (P) ⊕Γ (S c
+(M) \ {0}) ⊕Ω2
+(M, iR) →Ω2
+(M, iR) ⊕Γ (S c
−(M))
given by
F(τ, Φ, η) := (Ω+
τ −βΦ + η, DτΦ) .
Then, F−1({0}) is the set of solutions of the perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations.
The tangent mapping
P1
(τ,Φ,η) : Ω1(M, iR) ⊕Γ (S c
+(M)) ⊕Ω2
+(M, iR) →Ω2
+(M, iR) ⊕Γ (S c

of F is given by
P1
(τ,Φ,η)(α, φ, ζ) =

(dα)+ −βΦ,φ + ζ, Dτφ + i
2αΦ

.
(7.6.35)
The following lemma shows that, for generic η, the second cohomology group of the
perturbed Seiberg-Witten complex vanishes.
Lemma 7.6.16 For a generic perturbation, P1
(τ,Φ,η) is surjective.
Proof Let (γ, ϕ) be in the orthogonal complement of the image of P1
(τ,Φ,η) in the
sense of the L2-scalar product. Then,
0 = ⟨(γ, ϕ), P1
(τ,Φ,η)(0, 0, γ )⟩=∥γ ∥2 ,
and, thus, γ = 0. In the same way,
0 = ⟨(0, ϕ), P1
(τ,Φ,η)(α, 0, 0)⟩
implies ⟨i
2αΦ, ϕ⟩= 0. But, by assumption, Φ is not vanishing identically and, thus,
by Remark 7.6.14, Φ is nowhere vanishing on an open dense subset. It follows that
the linear mapping α 
→αΦ is ﬁbrewise injective. This implies ϕ = 0.
■
By point 1 of Remark 7.6.6, the zero set of the mapping F agrees with the zero set
of the corresponding extended mapping between appropriate Sobolev completions.
Thus, we may view F as a mapping between Banach spaces. Then, by the Implicit
Function Theorem, F−1({0}) is a Banach manifold. Moreover, one can show that the
canonical projection
π : F−1({0}) →Ω2
+(M, iR) ,
(τ, Φ, η) 
→η ,

600
7
Matter Fields and Model Building
is a smooth Fredholm mapping.29 Then, by the Sard-Smale Theorem30, the set of
regular values of π is dense in the target space. Thus, we can choose a regular value
η of π and we can build
π−1(η) = F−1
η ({0}) .
Then, by the Implicit Function Theorem, F−1
η ({0}) is a manifold. Clearly,
ML,η := F−1
η ({0})/G

is the moduli space for the perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations with G acting freely
for generic perturbations. Theorem 7.6.12 and Lemmas 7.6.15 and 7.6.16, combined
with the above functional analytic arguments, imply the following.
Theorem 7.6.17 Let b+
2 (M) > 0. Then, for generic values of η, the moduli space
ML,η is a smooth manifold whose dimension is given by
dim ML,η = 1
4c1(L)2 −1
4(2χ(M) + 3σ(M)) .
■
Remark 7.6.18
1. The subset of regular values η is a countable intersection of open and dense sets,
see Theorem 7.16 in [553].
2. One can prove that, for generic perturbations, ML,η is oriented. Let us sketch the
idea of the proof. Clearly, a manifold is orientable iff the top exterior power of
its tangent bundle is trivial. Then, choosing an orientation at one point yields an
orientation everywhere. Thus, here, it is enough to prove that the determinant line
bundle top T ML,η is trivial. For that purpose, following [159] one embeds ML,η
into

A (P) ⊕Γ ∞(S c
+(M) \ {0})

/G . Then, triviality follows from the simply-
connectedness of the latter space. Moreover, since the ﬁbres of T ML,η are given
by H1(ESW), the bundle top T(τ,Φ) ML,η coincides with the determinant of the
complex ESW. Analyzing this isomorphism according to Theorem 7.6.12, we
obtain a natural bijection between orientations of ML,η and orientations of the
vector space H 0(M) ⊕H 1(M) ⊕H 2
+ (M) .
♦
In the remainder of this section, we outline that the moduli space gives rise to differ-
ential topological invariants, called Seiberg-Witten invariants, which may be used to
distinguish between smooth structures on a given topological 4-manifold. By con-
struction, the moduli space depends both on the metric g, the spin structure s and
the perturbation η. The Seiberg-Witten invariants will be independent of g and η
and only dependent on the isomorphism class [s] of the Spinc-structure.31 Now, let
29See e.g. Sect. 3.4 in [459] for an easily readable proof. A smooth Fredholm mapping is a smooth
mapping whose tangent mapping is Fredholm.
30See e.g. Theorem B.13 in [553].

g0 and g1 be metrics with equivalent Spinc-structures s0 and s1, respectively. Let η0
and η1 be regular perturbations corresponding to (s0, g0) and (s1, g1), respectively.
Then, by the same methods as above, one can prove that the corresponding moduli
spaces are cobordant. Let us make this statement precise: let t 
→gt and t 
→st be
ﬁxed paths connecting g0 with g1 and s0 with s1, respectively. Consider the space
Z of all smooth paths t 
→ηt such that, for every t, ηt is gt-self-dual. For {ηt} ∈Z
deﬁne
W := {(t, τ, Φ) : t ∈[0, 1] , [(τ, Φ)] ∈M(M, {st}, {gt}, {ηt})} .
Now, in general, it will not be possible to ﬁnd a path t →ηt such that ηt is good
for every t. However, if we additionally assume b+
2 (M) ≥1, then there exists a
regular32 subset of Z of good paths. For a proof of the following proposition, we
refer to Theorem 7.21 of [553].
Proposition 7.6.19 Let b+
2 (M) ≥1. Then, for every regular path t 
→ηt, W is a
smooth oriented manifold of dimension
dim W = 1
4c1(L)2 −1
4(2χ(M) + 3σ(M)) + 1
(7.6.37)
with boundary
∂W = M(M, s1, g1, η1) −M(M, s0, g0, η0) .
The minus sign accounts for the reversal of the orientation.
■
Proposition 7.6.19 constitutes the basis for the discussion of invariants. It tells us that,
for a chosen equivalence class of Spinc-structures, different choices of g and η yield
cobordant moduli spaces provided b+
2 (M) ≥1. Now, we are prepared to deﬁne the
Seiberg-Witten invariants. In the remainder, we write c1, σ and χ for, respectively,
c1(L), σ(M) and χ(M).
First, assume dim ML,η = 0. Then, by (7.6.37),
1
4(c2
1 −σ) = 1
2(χ + σ) .
(7.6.38)
Since the left hand side is the real index of the Dirac operator, it is an even number.
By (7.6.29), for connected M, the right hand side is equal to 1 −b1 + b2
+ and,
thus, b2
+ −b1 is odd. Moreover, as a zero-dimensional compact manifold, ML,η
consists of a ﬁnite number of points for every regular value of η. Its orientation is
given as explained under point 2 of Remark 7.6.18. In the case under consideration,
top T(τ,Φ) ML,η ∼= R, see Sect. 7.4 of [553] for details. Thus, the orientation is
given by an assignment of ±1 to each point of ML,η, that is, we assign the number
ν(τ, Φ) = 1 if the orientation of the determinant line bundle coincides with the
natural orientation of R and −1 otherwise.

Deﬁnition 7.6.20 Let (M, g) be an oriented compact 4-dimensional Riemannian
manifold fulﬁlling b+
2 ≥1. Let there be chosen a Spinc-structure s of (M, g). If
dim ML,η = 0, where η is a chosen regular self-dual 2-form, then one deﬁnes
sw(M, s; g, η) :=

ν(τ, Φ) ,
(7.6.39)
where the sum runs over the ﬁnite set of all equivalence classes [(τ, Φ)] ∈ML,η.
Then, the following holds.
Theorem 7.6.21 (Seiberg-Witten) If b+
2 > 1, then the integer sw(M, s; g, η) is
independent of the choice of g and η. It only depends on the isomorphism class [s].
■
Consequently, the integer sw(M, s; g, η) is called the zero-dimensional Seiberg-
Witten invariant. Clearly, we can write sw(M, s).
Second, assume dim ML,η > 0. If this dimension is odd, we set
sw(M, s; g, η) = 0 .
If the dimension is even, dim ML,η = 2d, we have
1
4

c2
1 −2χ −3σ

= 2d .
This implies that b2
+ −b1 is again odd. Now, one proceeds as follows. For a cho-
sen point m0 ∈M, consider the group of pointed gauge transformations Gm0 :=
{u ∈G : u(m0) = 1}. Then, C →C /Gm0 is a principal U(1)-bundle which we de-
note by P. Let c1(P) be its ﬁrst Chern class. For any generic perturbation, the
moduli space is a compact oriented ﬁnite-dimensional submanifold of C /Gm0. Thus,
we can deﬁne
sw(M, s; g, η) :=

M(M,s,g,η)
c1(P)d .
(7.6.40)
Clearly, c1(P) may be viewed as the ﬁrst Chern class of a ﬁnite-dimensional U(1)-
bundle obtained by restriction to the submanifold M(M, s, g, η). Then, we have a
counterpart of Theorem 7.6.21.
Theorem 7.6.22 (Seiberg-Witten) If b+
2 > 1, then the integer sw(M, s; g, η) de-
ﬁned by (7.6.40) is independent of the choice of g and η. It only depends on the
isomorphism class [s].
■
Next, we list a few basic properties of the Seiberg-Witten invariants sw(M, s), to-
gether with consequences following from their non-vanishing. For the proofs we
refer to [553].

7.6 The Seiberg-Witten Model
603
(a) If b+
2 > 1, then the Seiberg-Witten invariants are zero for all but ﬁnitely many
Spinc-structures s.
(b) If (M, g) has positive scalar curvature and b2
+ ≥2, then all the Seiberg-Witten
invariants vanish.33 Thus, the non-vanishing of a Seiberg-Witten invariant on
a manifold M of the above type means that M does not admit a Riemannian
metric with positive scalar curvature. Note that this obstruction depends on the
differential (and not merely on the topological) structure of the 4-manifold.
(c) Assume that (M, g) has constant scalar curvature Sc. If b2
+ ≥2 and sw(M, s) ̸=
0, then
c2
1 ≤vol(M)
32π2 Sc2 .
Equality holds if there exists a pair (τ, Φ) fulﬁlling
|Ω+
τ |2 = 1
32Sc2 ,
Ω−
τ = 0 ,
∇Φ = 0 ,
|Φ|2 = −1
2Sc .
(d) Let (M, g) be an Einstein space. Assume c2
1 = 2χ +3σ, b+
2 ≥2 and sw(M, s) ̸=
0, then
−2χ ≤3σ ≤χ .
Moreover, 3σ = χ iff the universal cover of M is either R4 or the complex
hyperbolic space SU(2, 1)/U(2). This result belongs to LeBrun, see [408].
Far beyond the above points, there is a lot of deep applications of Seiberg-Witten
theory both in geometry and in differential topology.34
(a) First of all, Seiberg-Witten theory yields alternative, much simpler proofs of
results obtained via Donaldson theory, see e.g. the proof of the Donaldson Theo-
rem 6.6.3 in [553] or [487]. Nowadays, the Seiberg-Witten invariants belong to
the standard tool kit of differential topology of 4-manifolds. In particular, there
exists a cut-and-paste technique for the calculation of Seiberg-Witten invariants.
(b) The geometry of embedded algebraic curves in the complex projective 2-space
was studied. In this context, the Thom conjecture was proven by Kronheimer
and Mrowka, Morgan, Szabo and Taubes and Fintushel and Stern.
(c) Applying Seiberg-Witten theory to symplectic geometry turned out to be espe-
cially fruitful. In particular, Taubes identiﬁed the Seiberg-Witten invariants of a
compact 4-manifold with Gromov invariants. This led to an existence theorem
of pseudo-holomorphic curves in such manifolds.
33This is an immediate consequence of the a priori estimate (7.6.21) extended to the perturbed
Seiberg-Witten equation.
34Many of the results mentioned here were found immediately after the birth of Seiberg-Witten
theory. References can be found in the literature cited at the beginning of this section.

The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics
From the phenomenological point of view, the electromagnetic, the weak and the
stronginteractionsdifferdrastically,bothintheirstrengthandintheirrange.Nonethe-
less, it turns out that the principle of local gauge invariance is applicable to all of
them, leading to what nowadays is called the standard model of particle interactions.
All the particles described by the standard model are considered to be fundamental,
that is, they do not show any internal structure and may be considered as pointlike.35
The model whose classical ﬁeld theoretical structure we are going to describe has
a long history. First, based on earlier work by Glashow [247] and others, Weinberg
[656] and Salam [552] uniﬁed the electromagnetic and the weak interactions.36 One
of the basic ingredients was the Higgs mechanism as discussed in Sect.7.3, see [106,
186, 273, 274, 298-300, 364]. The second piece of the standard model, the the-
ory of strong interactions called Quantum Chromodynamics, was developed at the
beginning of the seventies, see [264, 513, 655]. This work was based upon funda-
mental earlier work by Gell-Mann and collaborators [235, 236]. For an exhaustive
presentation of the history of the standard model we refer to [657].
We start with recalling some basics from Chap.5, see Examples 5.1.21, 5.2.10,
5.3.9 and 5.3.25 where the general structures were illustrated for the case of the
Minkowski space. Comparing with these examples, the reader should note some
changes in the notation which we invented in order to be as close as possible to the
notation in the physics literature.37
Consider the Minkowski space (M, g), where g = diag[1, −1 −1 −1] , and its
(complexiﬁed) Clifford algebra Clc(M, g). For its generators {γμ} , μ = 0, . . . , 3 ,
we choose the following representation
γ0 =
0 1
1 0

,
γk =
 0
τk
−τk 0

,
35The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN allows to study the physics of the standard model
down to distances Δx ∼10−18cm. The experiments conﬁrm that, down to such distances, the
fundamental particles do not show any internal structure, indeed.
36For this work, Glashow, Weinberg and Salam received the Nobel prize in 1979.
37The conventions used below coincide e.g. with those in [565].

7.7 The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics
605
where τk , k = 1, 2, 3 , are the Pauli matrices. Then, the chirality operator38 is given
by γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3, that is,
γ5 =
−1 0
0 1

.
Thus,

γ5
2 = 1 , that is, γ 5 has eigenvalues ±1. This yields a direct sum decompo-
sition of the bispinor representation space Δ4 ∼= C4 into eigenspaces of γ5,
Δ4 = Δ+ ⊕Δ−.
For a bispinor ψ, we denote the elements corresponding to this decomposition by
ψL := 1
2(1 −γ 5)ψ ,
ψR := 1
2(1 + γ 5)ψ ,
(7.7.1)
and call them the left-handed and the right-handed components of ψ, respectively. In
the sequel, instead of Δ4 we will rather write C4. For building Lagrangians, we will
use the standard Hermitean form given by (5.3.55) which, here, will be denoted by
⟨·, ·⟩. Finally, we should stress that in this section we use the physical representation
of gauge potentials, cf. Remark 6.1.1.
Now, we can start building the standard model. It is an


gauge theory, containing three fermionic families, see Table7.1, a Higgs ﬁeld and
gauge ﬁelds mediating the electroweak and the strong interactions. The fermionic
families consist of leptons and quarks with equal quantum numbers but different
masses. There is no theoretical explanation of this fact. For clearness of presentation,
we will limit our attention to the ﬁrst fermionic family, consisting of the leptons
(νe, e), where e denotes the electron and νe the corresponding neutrino, and the
quarks (u, d). The remaining families must be dealt with in essentially the same
way. We will comment on that at the end of this section.

masses cannot be measured directly, but must be determined indirectly through their inﬂuence on
hadronic properties

Webeginwithdescribingtheelectroweakinteractionoftheleptons.Inthestandard
notation from particle physics, we associate with e and νe a bispinor ﬁeld on M which
we denote by the same letter. It is an experimental fact that in weak interactions
parity is not conserved and a right-handed neutrino is not observed. There is no
theoretical explanation of this fact within the model. Consequently, we decompose e
and νe into their left-handed and right-handed parts, according to (7.7.1), and build
an SU(2)-doublet from the left-handed parts of e and νe and an SU(2)-singlet from
the right-handed electron part,
Le =

eL

eR ,
(7.7.2)
that is, we postulate that Le transforms under the basic and eR under the trivial
representation of SU(2). From these objects we build

ψe(x) :=

(7.7.3)
Here, the bispinor space C4 carries the representation of the spin group SL(2, C) of
M given by (5.2.15) and C3 carries the representation of SU(2) just deﬁned,

In order to accommodate the electromagnetic interaction in this model, we proceed as

on C3 via

and require that, in any representation, the electric charge generator Qe be given by39
Qe = T3 + Y .
(7.7.5)
39Note that [Y, T3] = 0.

7.7 The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics
607
Applying Qe to Le and eR, from Table7.1 we read off the eigenvalues yL = −1
2 and
yR = −1, respectively.
To summarize, in the terminology of Sect.7.1, ψe is the global representative of
a section of type (μ, σ) of the bundle E = Es ⊗Ei associated with Q ×M P, where
(a) Es is the spinor bundle with typical ﬁbre C4 carrying the standard spinor rep-
resentation μ of SL(2, C), associated with the (trivial) spin structure bundle
Q(M, SL(2, C)),
(b) Ei is the complex vector bundle with typical ﬁbre C3 carrying the representation
σ = σL × σY of SU(2) × U(1), associated with the (trivial) principal bundle
P(M, SU(2) × U(1)).
In the next step, we introduce the gauge potential mediating the electroweak interac-
tion. In the geometric terminology, it is described by a connection form on P. Since
P is trivial, we can work with a global representative on M. We denote the su(2)-
component of the gauge potential by W and the u(1)-component by B, respectively.
Since in the analysis below, the coupling constants are relevant, we must use the
physical representation, cf. Remark 6.1.1. We denote the coupling constant with re-
spect to the SU(2)-symmetry and the U(1)-symmetry by g and g′, respectively, and
write gW and g′B, respectively. By the principle of minimal coupling introduced in
Sect.7.1, the interaction of gauge ﬁelds and fermionic matter ﬁelds is given via the
covariant derivative. According to (7.1.4), we have40
Dψe =

ψe .
(7.7.6)
Now, we are prepared to write down the gauge-invariant Lagrangian describing the

SU(2)×U(1)

-gauge theory of the leptonic family under consideration. According
to (6.2.1) and (7.1.9), it reads
Le = 1
2FW
.∧∗FW + 1
2FB ∧∗FB + ⟨ψe, D/ ψe⟩,
(7.7.7)
where FW and FB are the ﬁeld strength tensors of W and B, respectively, and D/ is
the Dirac operator built from (7.7.6), cf. formula (5.5.27). For convenience, in some
places below, instead of writing the Lagrangian as a 4-form we will write it as a
function on M without further commenting on that.
Remark 7.7.1 In standard coordinates {xμ} on M and in the Lie algebra bases {ta}
of su(2) and {i} of u(1) introduced above, we decompose
W = W a
μ ta ⊗dxμ ,
B = iBμ dxμ .

where
Wμν = ∂μWν −∂νWμ + g[Wμ, Wν] ,
Bμν = ∂μBν −∂νBμ
are the representatives of FW and FB, respectively.

We stress that, up until now, all fermions are massless. Naive mass terms of the
form m( ¯ψLψR + ¯ψRψL) would violate gauge invariance. We will see below that the
fermions are endowed with their masses via the Higgs mechanism. This will be our
next issue. We add a bosonic scalar ﬁeld

(7.7.12)
In the terminology of Sect.7.1, ϕ is the global representative of a section of type
(0, ρ) of the bundle E = Es ⊗Ei associated with Q ×M P, where
(a) Es is the tensor bundle T 0
0 (M) associated with the orthonormal frame bundle
Q = O(M) carrying the trivial representation of the Lorentz group, that is, ϕ is
a scalar ﬁeld.
(b) Ei is the complex vector bundle with typical ﬁbre C2 carrying the representation
ρ = ρL × ρY of SU(2) × U(1), associated with the (trivial) principal bundle
P(M, SU(2) × U(1)).

To summarize, the full Lagrangian describing the electroweak interaction of the
ﬁrst lepton family is then given by
L = Le + LH + LYuk .

Comparing with (7.7.5), this means that H is generated by Qe in the representation
ρ, that is, H is the electromagnetic subgroup U(1)em of SU(2) × U(1). Now, we can
apply the general theory of Sect.7.3. By Proposition 7.3.4, the particle content after
symmetry breaking is given by a triple

( ˆω, τ), η

, where ˆω is the connection form
of the residual gauge symmetry H, τ describes the intermediate vector boson and η
is the surviving Higgs ﬁeld. As usual, we denote the Lie algebra of H by h and take
the orthogonal decomposition

42Comparing with the general theory, instead of ηv we simply write v here.

It is now convenient to introduce the Weinberg angle θW describing the above mixing

(7.7.23)
We also see that, via the Yukawa coupling term in (7.7.13), the electron ﬁeld receives
a mass, whereas the neutrino remains massless. Indeed, inserting (7.7.16) into this
term, it reduces to

Finally, for the surviving Higgs ﬁeld we get the mass
mη = 2λv2 .
Now, it remains to identify the electromagnetic gauge potential Aem. It turns out
that Aem does not merely coincide with the full t+-component A given by (7.7.17).
We will ﬁnd the correct electromagnetic potential by postulating that after symmetry

as the electromagnetic coupling constant.
Remark 7.7.3
1. Recall that Zμ is invariant under local gauge transformations. Thus, it may be
viewed as the representative of a horizontal 1-form on the reduced principal
H-bundle. Thus, (7.7.26) may be interpreted as a relation between two represen-
tatives of connection forms differing by a horizontal 1-form, that is, Aem
μ is the
representative of a U(1)-connection form on the reduced bundle, indeed.
2. Up until now, the model contains 5 free parameters. They may be chosen as
e, sin(θW), me, mW and mη. Then,
mZ =

v = 2mW

Clearly, the full Lagrangian Le + LH may be rewritten in terms of the physical
ﬁelds ψe, W ±

μ , η and the chosen free parameters above. We omit this
lengthy expression here. The model obtained so far is called the Weinberg-Salam
model of electroweak interactions.

The experimental value of the Weinberg angle was found to be, see [16] for details,
sin2(θW) = 0.23153 ± 0.00016 .
(7.7.31)
Finally, we include the quark family (u, d). Again, we decompose u and d into
their left handed and right handed components and build an SU(2)-doublet and two
SU(2)-singlets,
Lq :=

uR ,
dR .
(7.7.32)
Now, applying again (7.7.5) and using the fractional electric charges of the quarks
provided by the quark model, see Table7.1, we obtain for Y the eigenvalues y = 1
6 for
Lq, y = 2
3 for uR and y = −1
3 for dR. Next, we have to take into account that the quark
ﬁelds interact also strongly. In the standard model, the corresponding gauge group,
called colour group, is chosen to be SU(3). With respect to this gauge symmetry,
the quarks are assumed to build triplets whereas the leptons and the Higgs ﬁeld are
assumed to be singlets. Thus, we introduce the quark matter ﬁeld
ψq : M →C4 ⊗C4 ⊗C3 ,
ψq(x) :=

45The existence of the Higgs boson was announced on July 4th 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS
Collaborations at CERN and conﬁrmed by later experiments, see [16] for details. The mass value
in the table is the one found by ATLAS. The CMS Collaboration found 125.7 ± 0.4 GeV. This
discovery conﬁrmed the Higgs sector as a fundamental building block of the standard model
experimentally. One year later, the Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to François Englert and
Peter W. Higgs.

From these formulae, the reader can easily read off the structure of the associated
bundle E of quark matter ﬁelds. We postulate that the strong interaction also be
mediated by a gauge ﬁeld. Accordingly, we pass to the (trivial) principal bundle P
over M with structure group (the full gauge group of the standard model)
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
and we introduce an additional SU(3)-gauge potential G mediating the strong inter-
action. We denote the ﬁeld strength tensor of G by FG. Again, by the principle of
minimal coupling introduced in Sect.7.1, the interaction of gauge ﬁelds and quark
ﬁelds is given via the covariant derivative,
Dψq =

d + gsλ′

(7.7.34)
where gs denotes the strong coupling constant. Now, we can write down the full
Lagrangian of the standard model before spontaneous symmetry breaking:
L = Lg + Lf + LH + LYuk ,

where
Lg = 1

and
Lf = ⟨ψe, /Dψe⟩+ ⟨ψq, /Dψq⟩.

7.7 The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics
615
Since the matter ﬁeld ϕ is in the trivial representation of SU(3), the colour symmetry
remains unbroken and the Higgs part LH is the same as in (7.7.15), that is, the Higgs
mechanism described before remains exactly the same. Clearly, the Yukawa coupling
term given by (7.7.14) must be modiﬁed by adding the corresponding interaction
terms of ϕ with the quark ﬁelds,
LYuk = −ce


(¯Leϕ)dR + ¯dR(ϕ†Lq)

,
(7.7.36)
where ˜ϕ = iτ2ϕ∗.
Remark 7.7.4
1. If one wishes to include the other two fermionic families, then formula (7.7.36)
must be modiﬁed essentially. Instead of the constants ce , cu and cd, one must
allow for complex matrices, called Kobayashi-Maskawa matrices, mixing lep-
tons and quarks of the same charge.46 Diagonalizing these matrices and passing
to ﬁelds with a well-deﬁned mass leads to a mixing of the original ﬁelds. This
change implies that in the charged currents built from the quark ﬁelds, mixing
matrices show up. The neutral currents are not affected by this change. For a
discussion of phenomenological consequences of these facts we refer to [468].
2. It turns out that, on quantum level, the standard model is renormalizable, that
is, the renormalized perturbation theory may be applied, see e.g. [656]. The
theoretical predictions obtained from this quantum ﬁeld theory have been very
well conﬁrmed by various types of experiments, see [16] for details.
We stress that the high energy and the low energy properties of the model are quite
different. For high energies E ≫mZ ∼100 GeV, the boson mass corrections of
order mz
E may be neglected. In such an approximation, the full SU(3) × SU(2) ×
U(1)-symmetry is manifest. In contrast, for small energies E ≪mZ, one only sees
the broken symmetry SU(3) × U(1)em. Schematically, this is often represented
as follows:
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
100 GeV
−→SU(3) × U(1)em .
In particular, for high energies, one may neglect the electroweak interactions of
quarks and one may consider a theory based upon the Lagrangian47
L = 1

This is the Lagrangian of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). For large momen-

46This is due to the postulate of fermion number conservation. Clearly, the matrices must be such
that the Yukawa coupling term remains gauge invariant. We refer to Sect. 22.4 of [468] for details.

may be applied. However, in the low energy sector, perturbative methods do not
work appropriately. In particular, it cannot be explained this way why quarks and
gluons are not observed. This is the famous quark conﬁnement problem.
♦
To summarize, the full standard model contains the following set of free parameters:
(a) The coupling constants gs, e, sin(θW),
(b) the boson masses mW, mη,
(c) the lepton masses me, mμ, mτ,
(d) the quark masses mu, md, mc, ms, mt, mb,
(e) the parameters of the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix ϑ1, ϑ2, ϑ3, δ.
For a fundamental theory, this number of independent parameters seems to be rather
high. Moreover, on the way we have pointed out a number of ad hoc assumptions
(taken from the experiment) which could not be explained theoretically. We should
add that the standard model predicts massless neutrinos, whereas several experiments
require small but non-vanishing neutrino masses. Moreover, the model does not really
explain the quantization of electric charge. Thus, the reader may ask himself whether
the standard model may be viewed as a truly uniﬁed theory.
Consequently, a lot of effort has been put into building further uniﬁcation schemes.
One of the most prominent variants, the so-called grand uniﬁcation (GUT) was
proposed already in 1974 by Georgi and Glashow [240]. The basic idea of grand
uniﬁcation is that, beyond a very high energy scale, elementary particle physics is
described by a gauge theory with a simple gauge group GU, that is, by a theory with
a single coupling constant. The Lie group GU should be large enough so that GSM =
SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) can be embedded into GU. At some energy MU, the symmetry
GU is spontaneously broken to GSM, thus, leading to the standard model. This idea
works, indeed [241]: by a renormalization group analysis within the standard model,
one shows that the values of the SU(2)- and SU(3)-coupling constants decrease at
larger momentum scales, whereas the value of the U(1)-coupling constant increases.
The coupling constants approach each other at the energy scale MU = 1016 GeV.
This is called the grand uniﬁcation scale. According to the idea of grand uniﬁcation,
we may now replace the reduction scheme outlined under point 2 of Remark 7.7.4 by
GU
MU
−→GSM
100 GeV
−−−−→SU(3) × U(1)em .
(7.7.37)
The search for an appropriate simple group GU was guided by a number of natural
requirements: ﬁrst, as already mentioned, it should be possible to embed GSM into
GU. Thus, GU must be at least of rank 4 and it should contain SU(3) as a subgroup.
Second, it must admit representations allowing for the correct particle spectrum and
it should be anomaly free.48 If one insists to accommodate the fermions in complex
representations, then only the simple Lie groups SU(n), with n ≥2 , SO(4n + 2)
and the exceptional group E6 remain as good candidates, see [438]. The requirement
that the theory be anomaly free excludes SO(6) and puts limitations on the allowed

representations for the unitary group. For a quite exhaustive study of the underly-
ing group theory as well as of the admissible representation schemes we refer to
[238, 597]. In the historical paper of Georgi and Glashow [240], the unifying gauge
group SU(5) was proposed. One year later, GU = SO(10) was introduced [222,
239].
In the sector of such a uniﬁed theory where GU is unbroken, completely new
phenomena occur. Since in this sector the gauge bosons involve both ﬂavor and color,
the baryon number is not conserved any more and thus, in most models, proton decay
is possible.49 Another remarkable feature of all realistic grand uniﬁcations is the fact
that they admit (superheavy) magnetic monopoles.
For an exhaustive review over the ﬁrst period of the development of GUT's we
refer to [400]. For more modern aspects, including supersymmetric GUT's, see [474]
and references therein.
In the next section, we are going to present another uniﬁcation approach which
has attracted much attention over the decades.

Dimensional Reduction. Basics
The idea of dimensional reduction can be traced back to the classical Kaluza-Klein
theory invented by Kaluza and Klein [355, 377], Einstein, Bergmann [181, 182] and
Weyl [660, 662]. Its application to non-Abelian gauge theories starts with the work
of Kerner [363], Forgacs and Manton [207] and Harnad, Shnider and Tafel [284].
Here, we concentrate on dimensional reduction of pure Yang-Mills theories. This
variant is often referred to as the CSDR scheme.50 Our presentation will be along
the lines of [394, 546], but we also refer to the review [356]. We will give further
references in the text and will comment on other variants of dimensional reduction at
the end. Our emphasis is on the method rather than on applications, as dimensional
reduction is an important tool for the study of differential equations with symmetries
in many branches of physics.
Let us consider a pure Yang-Mills theory on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold
(M, g) of signature (−, +, . . . , +). In the literature, M is given different names.
Often it is called a multidimensional universe, sometimes also a Kaluza-Klein space.
We will rather stick to the ﬁrst term. In short, the idea of dimensional reduction goes
as follows: assume we are given a symmetry group K acting on M in such a way that

the quotient M/K (or some piece of it) may be identiﬁed with physical spacetime.
Further assume that this symmetry may be lifted to the principal bundle of the gauge
theory under consideration. Then, one postulates K-invariance of the gauge ﬁeld
conﬁgurations and of the action functional and reduces the latter with respect to
this symmetry. This way, interesting uniﬁcation models may be constructed. In this
section, we use the notation and the results of Sect.1.9.
In more detail, let G be the gauge group and let (P, G, M, Ψ, π) be the gauge
principal bundle. We consider a simple group action51 δ : K × M →M of K on M
and assume that it can be lifted to an action Δ : K →Aut(P) such that the induced
left action ρ : (K × G) × P →P given by (1.9.1) is also simple. As in Sect.1.9, we
denote the orbit space P/(K × G) of this action by ˆM. We limit our presentation to
the version described by Remark 1.9.9 and Corollary 1.9.15, that is, given a stabilizer
H of δ, we assume that the principal ΓI/Z-bundle MI →ˆM is trivial. Note that then
also the principal ΓH-bundle MH →ˆM is trivial. Here, ΓH = NK(H)/H. Thus, we
may choose a global section s : ˆM →MH. As before, we denote ˜M := s( ˆM). Recall
that, in this situation, bundles admitting a lift of the K-action have the following
structure, cf. Eq.(1.9.24):
P ∼= K ×H

G ×CG(λ0(H)) ˜P

.
(7.8.1)
Here, λ0 : H →G is the Lie group homomorphism given by Eq.(1.9.4), ˜P ⊂P is a
principal CG(λ0(H))-bundle over ˜M and the right H-action on K ×

G ×CG(λ0(H)) ˜P

is given by
(h, (k, [(g, ˜p)])) 
→(kh, [(gλ0(h), ˜p)]) ,
h ∈H .
The diffeomorphism (7.8.1) is given by
[(k, [(g, ˜p)])] 
→Δk ◦Ψg−1(˜p) .
Now, the setting is given and we may start with the dimensional reduction procedure.
In the ﬁrst step, we must classify the K-invariant conﬁgurations (ω, g) entering the
action functional. For the gauge ﬁeld conﬁgurations ω, this problem has already been
solved: by Corollary 1.9.15, K-invariant connection forms ω on P are in one-to-one
correspondence with pairs ( ˜ω, ˜Φ), where
(a) ˜ω is a connection form on ˜P,
(b)
˜Φ : ˜P →L(m, g)H is a CG(λ0(H))-equivariant mapping.
Here, m ⊂k is given by
m = n ⊕p ,
(7.8.2)
where n = ˆnH is the Lie algebra of ΓH. With this notation, k = h⊕m . As usual, let us
denote the Ad-invariant scalar products on k and g by ⟨·, ·⟩k and ⟨·, ·⟩g, respectively.
51Recall that an action is called simple if it has only one orbit type.

7.8 Dimensional Reduction. Basics
619
By the discussion in Sect.1.9, without loss of generality we may assume that the
decomposition (1.9.25) is orthogonal with respect to ⟨·, ·⟩k. Then, the decomposition
(7.8.2) is orthogonal, too. Consequently, from now on we denote
m ≡h⊥,
p ≡n⊥.
(7.8.3)
Next, let us classify the K-invariant metrics on M. For any y ∈˜M, we decompose
TyM = Ty ˜M ⊕Ty (K · y) ,
(7.8.4)
where K · y is the K-orbit through y. We denote
Ny := δ′
y(n) ,
N⊥
y := δ′
y(n⊥) .
(7.8.5)
Then, Ty (K · y) = Ny ⊕N⊥
y and thus
TyM = Ty ˜M ⊕Ny ⊕N⊥
y .
(7.8.6)
Recall the isotropy representation52 δ′
h : H →Aut(TyM) induced from δ. Since
Ty (K · y) = δ′
y(h⊥) and
δ′
h ◦δ′
y(A) = δ′
y(Ad(h)A) ,
(7.8.7)
for any A ∈h⊥, the restriction of the isotropy representation to Ty (K ·y) is equivalent
to the restriction of the adjoint representation to h⊥.
In the sequel, in order to exclude pathological situations, we further assume that,
for any y ∈˜M, none of the components in the decomposition (7.8.6) is tangent to
the light cone {Y ∈TyM : g(Y, Y) = 0}.
Lemma 7.8.1 The subspace N⊥
y is g-orthogonal to Ty ˜M and to Ny.
Proof Since g is K-invariant, the isotropy representation δ′
h : H →Aut(TyM) is
orthogonal. It clearly acts trivially on Ty ˜M. By Remark I/6.2.10, Ty (K ·y) is invariant
under the isotropy representation. Thus, the decomposition (7.8.4) is invariant, too.
By reductivity of the decomposition k = h⊕h⊥, the action of H induces an action
on h⊥. Clearly, the maximal subspace of h⊥on which Ad(H) acts trivially is n. Thus,
in the decomposition of n and n⊥into Ad(H)-irreducible components,
n =
m
$
i=i
ni ,
n⊥=

$
j=i

the ni are (mutually orthogonal) one-dimensional subspaces. Inserting these decom-
positions into (7.8.5), we obtain

Consider the corresponding components of the metric viewed as mappings

Then,
g−1
(j,j) ◦g(i,j) : δ′
y(ni) →δ′
y(n⊥

is an operator intertwining the irreducible representations of δ′
y(ni) and δ′
y(n⊥
j ). This
follows from the K-invariance of g. Now, since the representations carried by the ni
are trivial and those carried by the n⊥
j are nontrivial, Schur's Lemma implies that this
operator must vanish for all pairs (i, j). Consequently, Ny and N⊥
y are orthogonal to
each other. In the same way, one shows that Ty ˜M is orthogonal to N⊥
y .
■
From Lemma 7.8.1, we immediately get the following.
Corollary 7.8.2 If ΓH is discrete, then the decomposition (7.8.4) is orthogonal with
respect to g.
■
The following proposition yields the classiﬁcation of K-invariant metrics.
Proposition 7.8.3 Let δ and ρ be simple group actions and assume that the bun-
dle MH →ˆM is trivial. Then, the K-invariant metrics g on M are in one-to-one
correspondence with 4-tuples
(˜g, ξ, β, β⊥) ,
(7.8.8)
where ˜gisametricon ˜M,ξ isaconnectionformontheprincipalΓH-bundleMH →ˆM
and β and β⊥are functions on ˜M with values in the Ad(H)-invariant non-degenerate
symmetric bilinear forms on n and n⊥, respectively.
Proof By K-invariance, the metric g is completely characterized by its values on ˜M.
Let y ∈˜M and denote
N1 := Ty ˜M ,
N2 := Ny ,
N3 := N⊥
y .
Let g(k,l) : Nl →

Nk∗, k, l = 1, 2, 3 , be the corresponding components of g. By
Lemma 7.8.1, we have
g(l,3) = g(3,l) = 0 ,
for l = 1, 2. The component g(1,1) yields ˜g. To deﬁne the connection form ξ, consider
the right K-action on M deﬁned by ˜δk := δk−1. Its restriction to ΓH yields the right
principal action on MH and x →Vx := ˜δ′
x(n) is the canonical vertical distribution.

By the K-invariance of g, H is ΓH-invariant and thus a horizontal distribution on the

The remaining properties are obvious. Finally, for the reconstruction of the K-
invariant metric g from the 4-tuple (7.8.8), we need to calculate the connection
form ξ. For that purpose, given y ∈˜M, we decompose any vector Y ∈TyMH with
respect to (7.8.6),
Y = ( ˜X, ˜δ′
y(A), ˜δ′

˜X ∈Ty ˜M , A ∈n , B ∈n⊥,
and, using the orthogonality condition, we read off the following vertical part:

Remark 7.8.4 Proposition 7.8.3 may be taken as a starting point for dimensional
reduction of theories including gravity, see [394] for a list of classical references.
In particular, we refer to [141] for more details. For an alternative approach based
upon reduction theory of the bundle of orthonormal frames, we refer to [538]. In this
paper, also the torsion case is included.

For clearness of presentation, we limit our attention to the following case. We assume
that the metric is of the form
g = ˜g ⊕ˆg ,
(7.8.10)
where ˜g is obtained from a metric on ˜M by K-invariant extension and ˆg is deﬁned by
ˆg(A∗, B∗) := gK/H(A, B) ,
A, B ∈n .
Here, gK/H is a K-invariant metric on K/H. Then, the decomposition (7.8.4) is
orthogonal,thatis,togetherwithN⊥
y ,alsoNy isorthogonaltoTy ˜M and,consequently,
ξ = 0 in the classifying 4-tuple (7.8.8). Under this assumption, the canonical volume
form on M reads
vg = v˜g ∧vˆg .
Using this and (2.7.5), we have53
S(ω) = 1

M
g−1(Ω, Ω) v˜g ∧vˆg .
Since both the connection and the metric are K-invariant, g−1(Ω, Ω) is K-invariant
and, thus, we may integrate over K/H. For that purpose, it is convenient to decompose
the scalar product deﬁned by β ⊕β⊥on each K-orbit with respect to a K-invariant
scalar product54 ⟨·, ·⟩k,
β(y) = f0(y)⟨·, ·⟩n ,
β⊥(y) = f1(y)⟨·, ·⟩n⊥.
This yields the volume form on the orbit K · y in terms of the canonical volume form
vK/H modiﬁed by a function f on ˜M:
vK·y = f (y) vK/H .
Then, integration over the orbits yields:
S(ω) = 1

(7.8.11)
Next, we decompose the integrand with respect to the direct product structure (7.8.10)
in terms of the classifying objects ( ˜ω, ˜Φ) given by Corollary 1.9.15. We rewrite
(7.8.4) as
TyM = Ty ˜M ⊕δ′
y(h⊥) ≡M1 ⊕M2
(7.8.12)
53Note that g−1 includes the scalar product in the Lie algebra gof the gauge group G. If the manifold
M is pseudo-Riemannian with signature (−, +, . . . , +), then one has to add an overall minus sign.

calculate Ω(1,2) and Ω(2,2). Since ω is K-invariant, it fulﬁls L A∗ω = 0, where

To summarize, as a result of dimensional reduction of a pure Yang-Mills theory,
we obtain a theory of a Yang-Mills ﬁeld interacting with a bosonic matter ﬁeld. The
action functional contains a self-interaction term of the matter ﬁeld which is of fourth
order. Thus, it is interesting to ask whether via this method one may construct Higgs
potentials. This would lead to a uniﬁcation scheme for the pure Yang-Mills and the
Higgs sector.
This question will be addressed in the next section. For a much deeper discussion
of this issue we refer to [394] and a lot of further references therein.

Dimensional Reduction. Model Building
In this section, we show that the dimensional reduction procedure leads to models
which are uniﬁed in the sense that one obtains constraints between the physical
parameters (coupling constants and masses) of the reduced theory. This way, one
can obtain predictions for the mass of one or of a number of particles in terms of the
remaining parameters.
From now on, we make the following technical assumptions.
(a) Both g and k are compact simple Lie algebras.
(b) Both h and λ′
0(h) are regular56 Lie subalgebras of k and g, respectively.
From the point of view of uniﬁcation, the ﬁrst assumption is certainly natural, because
in this case the reduced theory contains the smallest possible number of parameters.
In particular, there are unique, up to a constant, Ad-invariant scalar products ⟨·, ·⟩k
and ⟨·, ·⟩g on k and g, respectively. Concerning assumption (b), it is only for regular
subalgebras that we have canonical methods for calculating the centralizer and other
characteristics, see Appendix C.
Now, if we wish to construct models, we must of course explicitly solve the
constraint equation (1.9.47) expressing the H-invariance of ˜Φ,
˜Φ(˜p) ◦Ad(h) = Ad(λ0(h)) ◦˜Φ(˜p) ,
h ∈H .
(7.9.1)
From now on, we will use the following simpliﬁed notation:
λ′
0 ≡κ ,
˜Φ ≡φ .
Recall that any φ fulﬁlling the above relation may be interpreted as an operator
intertwining the representations Ad(H)(h⊥) and Ad(λ0(H))(g). Consequently, to
construct φ, one has to decompose the representations in (7.9.1) into irreducible
components. By Schur's Lemma, φ can only intertwine equivalent ones. Technically,
it is convenient to pass to the Lie algebraic version of (7.9.1),
φ(˜p) ◦ad(B) = ad(κ(B)) ◦φ(˜p) ,
B ∈h ,
(7.9.2)
and to work with the complexiﬁcations kC and gC of k and g, respectively. Corre-
spondingly, we extend φ to the complexiﬁed Lie algebras:
φC(A1 + iA2) := φ(A1) + iφ(A2) ,
A1, A2 ∈h⊥.
(7.9.3)
Then,
φC(A) = φC(A) ,
A ∈(h⊥)C ,
with the bar denoting complex conjugation, and we may extend (7.9.2) linearly to
56See Appendix C.

626

Matter Fields and Model Building
φC ◦ad(hC) = ad(κ(hC)) ◦φC .
(7.9.4)
Given a solution φC of this equation, by restriction to h⊥⊂(h⊥)C one obtains an
operator φ fulﬁlling (7.9.2). To summarize, we may ﬁrst solve (7.9.4) and then obtain
the solution by restriction to h⊥. For the ﬁrst step, we may use the representation
theory of (semi-)simple Lie algebras, see Appendix C or [170, 329] for a detailed
exposition.
In model building one is often interested in theories with one irreducible multiplet
of scalar ﬁelds only. As was shown by Kubyshin and Volobuev [643, 644], for
classical Lie groups this is always the case under the following additional assumption.
Proposition 7.9.1 Let the assumptions (a) and (b) be fulﬁlled, with K, H and G
being classical Lie groups. If, additionally, K/H is a simply connected irreducible
symmetric space, then the reduced theory contains only one irreducible multiplet of
scalar ﬁelds.
Proof The symmetric spaces fulﬁlling the assumptions are provided by Table2.1.
They read as follows:
GK(m, m + n) ,
Sp(m)/U(m) ,
SO(2m)/ U(m) ,
K = R, C, H .
Now, under the assumptions (a) and (b), ad(h) acts irreducibly on h⊥.57 Using this
fact,bydirectinspectionofthesespacesintermsofthecorrespondingrootlatticesone
can show the following: if one passes to the complexiﬁcation, either ad(h) remains
irreducible or it yields two inequivalent complex representations which are conjugate
to each other. Thus, φ either intertwines representations of one type or representations
of two types, conjugate to each other. By construction, the centralizer c of κ(h) in g
actsirreduciblyontheintertwiningoperators.Thus,thelatterconstituteanirreducible
multiplet.
■
By Proposition 7.9.1, the above class of symmetric spaces is especially interesting.
Thus, we concentrate on this case and, ﬁnally, add some comments on more general
settings. Let us deﬁne the following mappings:
f1 : 2h⊥→h ,
f1(A1 ∧A2) := [A1, A2] ,
f2 : 2h⊥→g ,
f2(A1 ∧A2) := [φ(A1), φ(A2)] .
By point 1 of Remark 2.5.6, we have
[h⊥, h⊥] = h .
(7.9.5)
Thus, the mapping f1 is surjective. If, additionally, K/H has rank one, then f1 is
an isomorphism of vector spaces. Indeed, in that case, f1(A ∧B) = [A, B] = 0
57Cf. point 2 of Remark 2.5.6.

7.9 Dimensional Reduction. Model Building

implies that A and B must be proportional, that is, A ∧B = 0. Moreover, under the
assumptions (a) and (b), the representation ad(h)(h⊥) is irreducible. This fact has
two immediate consequences. First, it implies that the Ad-invariant scalar product
on T[1]K/H ∼= h⊥is unique, up to a constant,58 and we may write
ˆg[1] = −1
m2 ⟨·, ·⟩h⊥,
(7.9.6)
where ⟨·, ·⟩h⊥denotes the restriction of the canonical scalar product ⟨·, ·⟩k to h⊥.
Second, since φ is an intertwiner, the transport of the canonical scalar product on g
to h⊥is an Ad(h)-invariant scalar product on h⊥and, thus, by the above assumption,
it must be proportional to the canonical scalar product on h⊥. Denoting the factor of
proportionality by |φ|2, for any A1, A2 ∈h⊥we obtain
⟨φ(A1), φ(A2)⟩g = |φ|2⟨A1, A2⟩h⊥.
(7.9.7)
Remark 7.9.2 For later purposes, let us calculate |φ|2 explicitly. Let {ei} and {Ej} be
orthonormal bases in h⊥and φ(h⊥) ⊂g, respectively. Then, the intertwiner φ may
be expanded as follows:
φ = φm
p(ep)∗⊗Em .
Then, for the left hand side of (7.9.7), we obtain
⟨φ(A1), φ(A2)⟩g = Ai

whereas for the right hand side we have

where %
Sc is the scalar curvature of gK/H.
Proof Since f1 is an isomorphism, there exists a mapping
f : h →g ,
f := f2 ◦f −1

.
Moreover, for any C ∈h, there exists a unique element α ∈2h⊥such that f1(α) =
C. Without loss of generality, we may assume α = A1 ∧A2 with A1, A2 ∈h⊥. Then,
C = [A1, A2] and we have
f ([A1, A2]) = [φ(A1), φ(A2)] .
(7.9.9)
Using this, together with the Jacobi identity in g and the fact that φ is an intertwiner,
we show that f is an operator intertwining the representations ad(h) and ad(κ(h)):
indeed, on the one hand, for any B ∈h we obtain
(adκ(B) ◦f ) (C) = [κ(B), f ([A1, A2])]
= [κ(B), [φ(A1), φ(A2)]]
= −[φ(A1), [φ(A2), κ(B)]] −[φ(A2), [κ(B)φ(A1)]]
= [φ(A1), φ([B, A2])] −[φ(A2), φ([B, A1])] .
On the other hand,
(f ◦ad(B)) (C) = f2 ◦f −1

= −f2 ◦f −1

([A1, [A2, B]] −[A2, [B, A1]])
= −f2(A1 ∧[A2, B]) −f2(A2 ∧[B, A1]])
= [φ(A1), φ([B, A2])] −[φ(A2), φ([B, A1])] .
Since, by assumption, κ is an isomorphism onto its image and since κ(h) ⊂g is
regular, there is only one adjoint representation of h in g, namely ad(κ(h)) acting on
κ(h), see [170]. We conclude
f (B) = cκ(B) ,
B ∈h ,
(7.9.10)
where c is some real constant. Then, for any A1, A2 ∈h⊥and any B ∈h,
⟨f ([A1, A2]), κ(B)⟩g = c⟨κ([A1, A2]), κ(B)⟩g = cε⟨[A1, A2], B⟩k .

7.9 Dimensional Reduction. Model Building
629
On the other hand, using the Ad-invariance of the scalar products,
⟨f ([A1, A2]), κ(B)⟩g = ⟨[φ(A1), φ(A2)], κ(B)⟩g
= ⟨φ(A2), φ([B, A1])⟩g
= |φ|2⟨[A1, A2], B⟩k .
Thus,
c = 1
ε |φ|2 ,
and, consequently, by (7.9.9) and (7.9.10),
[φ(A1), φ(A2)] = 1
ε |φ|2κ([A1, A2]) .

(7.8.17) and using (7.9.6) and (7.9.12), together with the Ad-invariance of the scalar
product, we obtain the assertion.
■
The following example is taken from [547].
Example 7.9.4 (Georgi-Glashow model) We consider the case
K/H = SO(l + 1)/SO(l) ,
G = SO(l + p) ,
with l = 2n and p = 2k + 1. Then, h and κ(h) may be embedded regularly. Let
us ﬁnd the decompositions of the Lie algebras k and g in terms of the root lattices
introduced in Appendix C. The left diagram in Fig.7.2 shows the decomposition of
k. The roots contained in the triangles with the corners α1, αn−1, α(1, n −1) and β1,
βn−1, β(1, n −1) correspond to the Lie subalgebra h = Dn ⊂Bn. To prove this, we
observe that the root βn−1 = αn−1 + 2αn, together with the roots α1, . . . , αn−1, may
be taken as a system of simple roots of h. This follows from the fact that βn−1 −αi
is not a root for i = 1, . . . , n −1. On the other hand, ⟨βn−1, αi⟩∗= 0 for i ̸= n −2
and ⟨βn−1, αn−2⟩∗= −1. Thus, the roots α1, . . . , αn−1, βn−1 constitute the Dynkin
diagram of Dn, cf. Fig. C.1. The subspace h⊥is spanned by the root vectors of the
roots α(1, n), . . . , α(n, n) (ﬁlled circles) and the root vectors of the corresponding

Fig. 7.2 Decomposition of k = Bn (left) and g = Bn+k (right) in terms of the root diagram
negative roots −α(1, n), . . . , −α(n, n). Since dim h⊥= 2n, h⊥carries the vector
representation of Dn.
Next, let us discuss the right diagram in Fig.7.2 showing the decomposition of g.
In analogy with the left diagram, the roots in the triangles (α1, αn−1, α(1, n−1)) and
(β1, βn−1, β(1, n −1)) build a Dn-subalgebra of Bn+k. We denote the root vectors in
Bn+k by Eα and choose the homomorphism κ : h →g as follows:
κ(eαi) := Eαi ,
κ(eβn−1) := Eβn−1 ,
i = 1, . . . , n −1 .
Thus, ε = 1, that is,
⟨κ(B1), κ(B2)⟩g = ⟨B1, B2⟩k ,
B1, B2 ∈h .
Now, the decomposition of the representation ad(g)↾κ(h) looks as follows: clearly,
the triangle (αn+1, αn+k, βn+1) carries the trivial representation of Dn. Thus, the
centralizer of κ(h) in g is c = Bk. Consequently, the structure group CG(λ(H)) of
the reduced theory is SO(2k + 1). The fact that, in the case under consideration, c
does not contain any Abelian subalgebra is an immediate consequence of equation
(C.1). Next, the two segments (α(1, n −1 + i), . . . , α(n, n −1 + i)) with i =
1, . . . , k + 1 and (β(1, n −1 + i), . . . , β(n, n −1 + i)) with i = 1, . . . , k, together

7.9 Dimensional Reduction. Model Building
631
with the corresponding negative roots 2k+1, form vector representations of Dn. More
precisely, we have one real representation ϑ0, and the 2k complex representations ϑi
spanned by the root vectors (eα(j,n−1+i), . . . , e−β(j,n−1+i)) and ˜ϑi spanned by the root
vectors (e−α(j,n−1+i), . . . , eβ(j,n−1+i)), where j = 1, . . . , n.
For the sake of completeness, let us write down the scalar ﬁeld φ60:
φ =

k,i
φk(ei)∗⊗˜Eik .
Here, {ei} is the basis of root vectors in h⊥and { ˜Eik} are bases in the representations
ϑ0 and ϑi, invariant under complex conjugation. Clearly, φ carries the vector repre-
sentation of the centralizer c. Finally, using (7.9.6) and (7.9.12), one easily calculates
the scalar curvature (Exercise 7.9.1),
%
Sc = m2l(l −1) .
(7.9.13)
This yields
V (φ) = m4l(l −1)(1 −|φ|2)2 .
If one writes down the scalar products in (7.8.15) explicitly, then the ﬁrst two terms
acquire factors which are functions of the constants m, l and p. Thus, if one wants to

where g is the coupling constant of the reduced theory. For p = 3 we get the bosonic
sector of the Georgi-Glashow model, cf. Example 7.3.7. Using the formulae for the

In a similar way, one may attempt to construct the bosonic sector of the Weinberg-
Salam model, see [423, 644]. In the following example, we present the results of
Kubyshin and Volobuev [644]. Since the method is the same as in Example 7.9.4,
we omit the calculations.

model described in Sect.7.7. It is interesting to compare the masses and the Weinberg
angle obtained via the dimensional reduction method with the experimental data.
Instead of the four parameters MW, MZ, MH and sin2 θW characterizing the bosonic
sector, cf. Remark 7.7.3, we have only 3 independent parameters here: the non-
Abelian coupling constant g, which is proportional to the coupling constant of the
unreduced pure Yang-Mills theory on the multidimensional universe, the reciprocal
linear scale m of the internal space, cf. Eq.(7.9.6), and the dimension l of that space.
This allows for a prediction of the Higgs mass on tree level. It can be shown that in
all the above cases, the correct value of the electric charge e can be obtained by an
appropriate choice of the coupling constant g. This should be clear from (7.7.28).
Comparing with (7.7.31), we see that the third model of the above table yields the best
agreement with the experimental value of the Weinberg angle: for l = 3 we obtain
sin2 θW = 0.25. Unfortunately, in this case, the predicted value of the Higgs mass is
too small. It coincides with the mass of the intermediate vector boson Z. It should be
noted that, on the other hand, the relation of the Z- and the W-mass is in quite good
agreement with the experimental value. Comparing with the corresponding table in
Sect.7.7, we see that the model in the ﬁrst row yields a rather nice prediction of the
Higgs mass, but sin2 θW is too large.
Finally, we note that Manton [423] has obtained similar results for models with
gauge groups SU(3), SO(5) and G2 on the six-dimensional universe M × S2 with
rotational symmetry.

Remark 7.9.6
1. IfonedepartsfromtheassumptionthatK/H besymmetric,whilekeepingκ injec-
tive, then new phenomena occur. In this case, h⊥decomposes into h⊥= n ⊕n⊥,
cf. (7.8.2) and (7.8.3). Now, in addition to intertwining non-trivial representations
in n⊥with non-trivial representations in g, in general also trivial representations
of n and of c ⊂g will be intertwined. The latter phenomenon is new, comparing
with the case of a symmetric space. For details, see Proposition 4.2 in [547]. An
example of this type is provided by

7.9 Dimensional Reduction. Model Building
633
K/H = SU(5)/SU(4) ∼= S9 ,
G = SO(9) .
If we also drop the assumption that κ be injective, then h decomposes into
h = h1 ⊕h2 ,
h1 ∼= im κ ,
h2 = ker κ ,
and the intertwining condition (7.9.2) reads
φ ◦ad(B1) = ad(κ(B1)) ◦φ ,
φ ◦ad(B2) = 0 ,
for B1 ∈h1 and B2 ∈h2. The second of these equations says that we get a
non-trivial operator φ iff there is a trivial representation in ad(k)↾h2(h⊥). On the
other hand, to get a non-trivial self-interaction for φ subject to the ﬁrst of these
equations, there must be a non-trivial representation in ad(k)↾h1(h⊥). An example
illustrating this situation is provided by
K/H = SO(9)/(SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)) ,
G = SU(n + 3) .
This example is worked out in detail in [547].
2. Finally, we note that a lot of effort has been put into building grand uniﬁcation
models via dimensional reduction, see e.g. [51, 417, 548] and a lot of further
references therein. Later on, the method has been extended to include supersym-
metric models, see e.g. [337, 422] and further references therein.
3. From the above discussion we see that the dimensional reduction method yields
relations between the parameters of the classical theory. It is interesting to ask
whether these relations survive in some sense on quantum level. This problem
is related to the procedure of reduction of couplings in quantum ﬁeld theory, cf.
[588] and references therein.

Chapter 8
The Gauge Orbit Space
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we discuss the mathematical structure of the gauge
orbit space stratiﬁcation. In Sect.8.2, we prove that there is a one-to-one correspon-
dence between orbit types and a certain type of bundle reductions of the principal
bundle under consideration. In Sect.8.3, we study the structure of the gauge orbit
stratiﬁcation in some detail. We prove a Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem and use
this to show that the strata are smooth manifolds and that the stratiﬁcation is regular.
In Sect.8.4, we study the geometry of the strata. We show that every stratum admits a
natural Riemannian metric, calculate its volume element and ﬁnd the corresponding
Riemann curvature. We also brieﬂy comment on geodesics.
In the second part of the chapter, we present our results on the enumeration of
gauge orbit types in detail. For clearness of presentation, we limit our attention to the
case G = SU(n). The result is given in terms of certain characteristic classes fulﬁlling
a number of algebraic relations. We also show how the natural partial ordering of
strata, which contains information on how the strata are linked, can be read off from
these relations.
8.1
Introduction
Let us start with a brief introduction to the ﬁnal two chapters which are closely
related. In the present chapter, we study the rich geometric and topological structure
of the classical conﬁguration space of gauge theories. In the next chapter, we will
discuss some aspects of the signiﬁcance of this structure for quantum gauge theory.
Roughly speaking, the methods used in quantum ﬁeld theory may be divided into
perturbative and non-perturbative ones. In the case of the standard model, whose
classical ﬁeld theoretic structure was presented in the previous chapter, perturbation

The Gauge Orbit Space
rigoroustheoreticalexplanationyet.Tostudythem,avarietyofdifferentconceptsand
mathematical methods has been developed. In particular, for some aspects, methods
of differential geometry and algebraic topology seem to be unavoidable. This is
certainly true if one wants to investigate the inﬂuence of the structure of the classical
conﬁguration space, the gauge orbit space, on quantum level. Let us discuss some
aspects indicating the physical relevance of this structure.
First, studying the geometry and topology of the generic (principal) stratum, one
gets an intrinsic topological interpretation of the Gribov ambiguity [258, 591]. We
stress that the problem of ﬁnding all Gribov copies has been discussed within spe-
ciﬁc models, see e.g. [401]. For a detailed analysis in the case of 2-dimensional
cylindrical spacetime (including the Hamiltonian path integral) we refer to [584].
By investigating the topology of the determinant line bundle over the generic stra-
tum, one gets an understanding of gauge anomalies in terms of the Family Index
Theorem [17, 41], see also [114] for the Hamiltonian approach. In particular, one
gets anomalies of purely topological type [674], referred to as global anomalies.
The latter cannot be seen by perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory. Moreover, there are
partial results and conjectures concerning the relevance of nongeneric strata. First,
generally speaking, nongeneric gauge orbits affect the classical motion on the orbit
space due to boundary conditions and, in this way, they may produce nontrivial
contributions to the path integral. They may lead to localization of certain quantum
states, as it was suggested by ﬁnite-dimensional examples [185]. Further, the gauge
ﬁeld conﬁgurations belonging to nongeneric orbits can possess a magnetic charge,
i.e. they can be considered as a kind of magnetic monopole conﬁgurations. Accord-
ing to 't Hooft [624], these could be responsible for quark conﬁnement. The role of
these conﬁgurations was investigated within the framework of Schrödinger quantum
mechanics on the gauge orbit space of topological Chern-Simons theory in [25], see
also [24] for an approach to 4-dimensional Yang-Mills theories with θ-term. Within
't Hooft's concept, the idea of Abelian projection is of special importance and has
been discussed by many authors. For example, this concept was studied within the
setting of quantum ﬁeld theory at ﬁnite temperature on the 4-torus [205, 206]. There,
a hierarchy of defects, which should be related to the gauge orbit space structure, was
discovered. Finally, let us also mention that the existence of additional anomalies
corresponding to nongeneric strata was suggested, see [290].
Most of the problems mentioned here are still awaiting a systematic investigation.
For that purpose, a deeper insight into the structure of the gauge orbit space is
necessary. In a series of papers [296, 297, 543-545] we have made a step in this
direction. We have given a complete solution to the problem of determining the
strata that are present in the gauge orbit space for gauge theories with the classical
gauge groups SU(n), Sp(n) and SO(n) in compact Euclidean spacetime of dimension
d = 2, 3, 4. Our analysis is based on the results of Kondracki and Rogulski [388],
who have investigated the general structure of the full gauge orbit space for the ﬁrst
time in detail. In particular, they have shown that the gauge orbit space is a stratiﬁed
topological space. Moreover, they have described the relation between orbit types
and bundle reductions we are using.

8.1 Introduction
637
Let us mention that there is an approach based upon parameterizing the full gauge
orbit space by a so called fundamental domain. The latter is characterized by the
property that it is intersected by every gauge orbit exactly once, up to possible
identiﬁcations on the boundary, see [148, 223, 640, 641, 699] and the review [642]
for further references. This concept was developed in order to solve the Gribov
problem, see Sect.9.2 for further details. However, for the study of the stratiﬁed
structure of the gauge orbit space, this concept seems not to be efﬁcient. Finally, we
note that the stratiﬁcation structure for gauge theories within the Ashtekar approach
has also been studied, see [203].
Clearly, as already mentioned above, the main challenge consists in clarifying the
possible role of the nongeneric strata on quantum level in a systematic way. For that
purpose, one needs a general concept how to implement these strata in a quantum
gauge theory. For the case of spaces carrying a Kähler structure, one may use the
concept of Hilbert space costratiﬁcation as proposed by Huebschmann [326]. In
[328], these ideas were substantiated for a toy model of Hamiltonian quantum gauge
theory on a ﬁnite lattice as developed in [368, 369, 386]. Here, the classical phase
space may be identiﬁed with a product of copies of the complexiﬁed structure group,
which carries a natural Kähler structure, and the classical stratiﬁcation is encoded
in terms of a costratiﬁcation of the representation space of the observable algebra.
Details will be explained in Sects.9.6 and 9.7.
8.2
Gauge Orbit Types
We start with recalling some basics from Sect.6.1. The conﬁguration space C of a
Yang-Mills theory on a principal bundle P(M, G) is the set of connections on P. It
carries a natural afﬁne structure with translation vector space
T = Ω1(M, Ad(P)) ∼= Ω1
Ad,hor(P, g) ,
(8.2.1)
and is acted upon by the group of vertical automorphisms G = AutM(P). By Remark
6.1.2, elements u ∈G may be viewed as sections of the vector bundle End(Ad(P)).
Then, local gauge transformations read
ω(u) = ω + u−1∇ωu .
(8.2.2)
As explained in Sect.6.1, if we assume that G be a compact connected linear Lie
group and that M be a compact orientable Riemannian manifold, we can pass to
Sobolev completions of C and G . As before, we denote the Hilbert space of cross
sections of Sobolev class k of a vector bundle E by Wk(E). In the sequel, we assume
k > 1
2 dim(M) + 1 .
(8.2.3)

638
8
The Gauge Orbit Space
Then, by the Sobolev Embedding Theorem 5.7.7, connection forms are of class C1
and, therefore, have continuous curvature. This theorem also implies that G is a
Hilbert-Lie group with Lie algebra LG = Wk+1(Ad(P)) and exponential mapping
given by (6.1.13) acting smoothly on C . Moreover, by Theorem 6.1.7, the action of
G is proper. Thus, the orbits of the action of G on C are closed and the gauge orbit
space
M := C /G
(8.2.4)
is Hausdorff.
Remark 8.2.1 Clearly, M should not depend essentially on the technical parameter
k. Thus, let k′ > k and let C ′, G ′ and M ′ be the Sobolev completions corresponding
to k′. Then, one has natural embeddings G ′ →G and C ′ →C . As a consequence
of the ﬁrst, the latter projects to a mapping ϕ : M ′ →M . Since the image of C ′ in
C is dense, so is ϕ

M ′
in M . To see that ϕ is injective, let ω1, ω2 ∈C ′ and u ∈G
such that ω2 = ω(u)
1 . Then (8.2.2) implies
du = u ω2 −ω1 u .
(8.2.5)
Due to 2k′ > 2k > dim M, by the multiplication rule for Sobolev functions, the
right hand side of (8.2.5) is of class Wk+1. Then u is of class Wk+2. This can be
iterated until the right hand side is of class Wk′. Hence, u ∈G ′, so that ω1 and ω2
are representatives of the same element of M ′. This shows that M ′ can be identiﬁed
with a dense subset of M . Another question is whether the orbit type stratiﬁcation
of M to be discussed below depends on k. Fortunately, the answer to this question
is negative, see Theorem 8.2.8.
♦
As discussed in Chap.6 of Part I, the orbit space of a proper Lie group action in ﬁnite
dimensions is a stratiﬁed space with the strata being the connected components of
the orbit type subsets. Kondracki and Rogulski [388] have shown that in the case of
the gauge orbit space, the situation is similar. We will discuss this in Sect.8.3. For
now, let us recall the notion of orbit type and relate orbit types to bundle reductions.
For a connection ω and a point p0, let Hp0(ω) and Pp0(ω) denote the holonomy group
and the holonomy bundle of ω based at p0, respectively. Since, under the assumption
(8.2.3), ω is of class C1, Pp0(ω) is a bundle reduction of P of class C2.
The stabilizer of ω ∈C under the action of G is given by
Gω = {u ∈G : ω(u) = ω} .
By the Stabilizer Theorem 6.1.5, this is a compact Lie subgroup of G with Lie algebra
LGω = ker(∇ω) = {ξ ∈LG : ξ↾Pp0(ω) = const} .
(8.2.6)
Since
Gω(u) = u−1Gωu ,

8.2 Gauge Orbit Types
639
the stabilizers along an orbit form a conjugacy class in G . This class is referred to as
the type of that orbit. The set of all orbit types of the action of G on C will be denoted
by . This set carries a natural partial ordering: for τ, τ ′ ∈, one has τ ≤τ ′ iff
there are representatives Gω of τ and Gω′ of τ ′ such that Gω ⊃Gω′.1
The discussion of the orbit types of the action of G on C rests on the fact that they
can be expressed in terms of bundle reductions of P. This relation will be analyzed
now. Given a subset A ⊂G, let CG(A) denote the centralizer in G. For repeated
centralizers, we write C2
G(A) = CG

CG(A)

etc.
Now, let p0 ∈P be chosen. To every subgroup S ⊂G , we assign a subset of P by
Φp0(S) = {p ∈P : u(p) = u(p0) for all u ∈S} .
(8.2.7)
Given Lie subgroups H ⊂K ⊂G and a reduction Q of P to H, for the induced
reduction of P to K we write
Q · K = {p ∈P : p = Ψk(q) for some k ∈K and some q ∈Q} .

(8.2.10)
Proof 1.
First, we prove (8.2.8). Let ω ∈C and u ∈Gω. By Lemma 6.1.4, the
restriction of u to Pp0(ω) is constant. By equivariance, it is also constant on the bundle

by the Stabilizer Theorem 6.1.5. Thus,

Conversely, let p ∈Φp0(Gω). Then, u(p) = u(p0) for all u ∈Gω. Clearly, there exists
a ∈G such that Ψa(p) ∈Pp0(ω) and, by Lemma 6.1.4,
u(p0) = u (Ψa(p)) = a−1u(p)a = a−1u(p0)a
1This choice of partial ordering corresponds to comparing the size of the orbits. It is consistent with
[103] but not with [388] and several other authors who choose the inverse partial ordering.

Now, consider (8.2.9). Inclusion from left to right holds by deﬁnition of Φp0(Gω).
Conversely, by (8.2.8), if u is constant on Φp0(Gω), then it is constant on Pp0(ω). By
Lemma 6.1.4, this implies u ∈Gω.
2. We have p ∈Φp0

iff u(p)h(p)u(p)−1 = u(p0)h(p0)u(p0)−1 for all


Ψu(p0) (ϑu−1(p))

for all h ∈S, that is, it is equivalent to Ψu(p0) (ϑu−1(p)) ∈Φp0(S).
■
Remark 8.2.3 According to point 1 of Lemma6.1.4, if the subgroup S is the stabilizer
of a connection ω, then Φp0(S) is a bundle reduction of class Ck+1 of P. In [388], the
subbundle Φp0 (Gω) is called the evolution bundle generated by ω.
♦
Deﬁnition 8.2.4 (Howe subgroup) A subgroup H ⊂G is called a Howe subgroup
if H = CG(A) for some subset A ⊂G.
Remark 8.2.5
1. Since the centralizer is a closed subgroup, a Howe subgroup is closed and, there-
fore, a Lie subgroup. Moreover, it is easy to see that C3
G(A) = CG(A) for any
subset A ⊂G. Thus, if H = CG(A), then
C2
G(H) = C3
G(A) = CG(A) = H .
Since H ⊂C2
G(H), we conclude that H ⊂G is Howe iff H = C2
G(H).
2. If H ⊂G is Howe, then H′ = CG(H) is Howe, too, and one has
H = C2
G(H) = CG(H′) .
A pair (H, H′) of subgroups of G fulﬁlling H = CG(H′) and H′ = CG(H) is
referred to as a Howe dual pair in G. To summarize, Howe subgroups are in
one-to-one correspondence with Howe dual pairs via H →(H, CG(H)).
3. Denote Gω(p0) = {u(p0) : u ∈Gω}. By the Stabilizer Theorem 6.1.5, Gω(p0) =
CG(Hp0(ω)). Thus, by point 2,

Gω(p0), C2

is a Howe dual pair in G.
4. AHowedualpairiscalledreductiveiffitsmembersarereductive.ReductiveHowe
dual pairs play an important role in the representation theory of Lie groups, cf.
[319]. There exist, essentially, two methods for the classiﬁcation theory of reduc-
tive Howe dual pairs. One of them applies to the isometry groups of Hermitean
spaces and uses the theory of Hermitean forms [456, 524, 561]. The other method
applies to complex semisimple Lie algebras and uses root space techniques [537].

8.2 Gauge Orbit Types

Deﬁnition 8.2.6 Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle.
1. A bundle reduction of P to a Howe subgroup will be called a Howe subbundle.
2. A bundle reduction Q of P of class Cr is said to be holonomy-induced if there
exists a connected bundle reduction ˜Q of P of class Cr to a subgroup ˜H ⊂G such
that
Q = ˜Q · C2
G

˜H

.
(8.2.11)
The set of isomorphism classes of holonomy-induced reductions of P of class C0,
factorized by the action of the structure group G, will be denoted by Red∗(P).
Remark 8.2.7
1. We equip Red∗(P) with a partial ordering as follows. For η, η′ ∈Red∗(P) we
write η ≥η′ if there exist representatives Q of η and Q′ of η′ such that Q ⊂Q′.
2. The reduction Q is the extension of ˜Q to the Howe subgroup of G generated by
˜H. In particular, every holonomy-induced reduction is a Howe subbundle.
3. Assume that Q and ˜Q are of class C0. By Proposition 3.6.2, ˜Q is vertically C0-
isomorphic to a smooth principal ˜H-bundle ˜Q∞. Let Q∞and P∞denote the
extensionsof ˜Q∞tothestructuregroupsCG( ˜H)andG,respectively.Everyvertical
C0-isomorphism ˜Q →˜Q∞extends to a vertical C0-isomorphism Q →Q∞and
to a vertical C0-isomorphism P →P∞. Since P and P∞are of class C∞and
vertically C0-isomorphic, Proposition 3.6.4 implies that they are vertically C∞-
isomorphic.ViasuchaC∞-isomorphism, ˜Q∞andQ∞becomebeundlereductions
of P of class C∞. This shows that Red∗(P) coincides with the set of vertical C∞-
isomorphism classes of smooth holonomy-induced bundle reductions.
♦
Theorem 8.2.8 Let M be a compact connected manifold and assume dim M ≥
2. Then, the assignment Φp0 induces an order-preserving bijection from  onto
Red∗(P).
Proof In the proof, we have to make the Sobolev classes transparent.
Let τ ∈ and let there be chosen a representative S ⊂G k+1. There exists
ω ∈C k such that S = G k+1
ω
. According to point 1 of Lemma 8.2.2, Φp0(S) is
given by the extension of the bundle reduction Pp0(ω) ⊂P to the structure group
C2
G(Hp0(ω)). Since Pp0(ω) is of class C0, so is Φp0(S). Since Pp0(ω) is connected,
Φp0(S) is holonomy-induced of class C0. According to point 2 of Lemma 8.2.2, if S is
conjugate in G k+1 to some S′, Φp0(S) and Φp0(S′) are conjugate under the actions of
G k+1 and G. Then, since vertical automorphisms from G k+1 are continuous, Φp0(S)
and Φp0(S′) are C0-isomorphic. Thus, Φp0 projects to a mapping from  to Red∗(P).
To check that this mapping is surjective, let an element of Red∗(P) be given.
By Remark 8.2.7/3, we may choose a representative Q ⊂P which is smooth and
which is generated via (8.2.11) by a smooth connected bundle reduction ˜Q. Using
the principal action Ψ , we may achieve that p0 ∈˜Q. Since dim M ≥2, point 5 of
Remark 1.7.16 yields that ˜Q carries a smooth connection with holonomy group ˜H.
This connection extends to a unique smooth connection ω on P obeying Pp0(ω) = ˜Q
and Hp0(ω) = ˜H. Then, by point 1 of Lemma 8.2.2 and (8.2.11),

642

The Gauge Orbit Space
Φp0(G k+1

G( ˜H) = Q .
This proves surjectivity.
To show that the projected mapping is injective, let τ, τ ′ ∈. Choose representa-
tives S, S′ and assume that Φp0(S′) and Φp0(S)·a are C0-isomorphic for some a ∈G.
Since these bundles are of class Ck+1, Proposition 3.6.4 implies2 that there exists a
vertical isomorphism of class Ck+1. Every such isomorphism extends equivariantly
to a vertical Ck+1-automorphism ϑ of P. Let u ∈G k+1 denote the corresponding
equivariant mapping. By construction,

By (8.2.10), then
Φp0(S′) = Ψu(p0)a

.
This implies, in particular, that Ψu(p0)a(p0) is in Φp0(S′) again, so that u(p0)a belongs
to the structure group of Φp0(S′). Thus, in fact we have
Φp0(S′) = Φp0(uSu−1) .
Now, the assertion follows from (8.2.9), because S and S′ are stabilizers.

Remark 8.2.9
1. As a consequence of Theorem 8.2.8, the set  does not depend on k.
2. For later use, let us introduce the notation C S for the subset of connections with
stabilizer S, C τ for the subset of connections of orbit type τ and M τ for the
subset of orbits of type τ. Correspondingly, we deﬁne
C ≤S :=

S′⊇S
C S′ ,
C ≤τ :=

τ ′≤τ
C τ ′ ,
M ≤τ :=

τ ′≤τ
M τ ′ ,
and, by analogy, C ≥S, C ≥τ, M ≥τ.
3. The notion of holonomy-induced bundle reduction may be viewed as an abstract
version of the notion of evolution subbundle generated by a connection which
was introduced in [388]. Correspondingly, Theorem 8.2.8 is an abstract version
of Theorem 4.2.1 in [388]. The geometric ideas behind are also contained in [289,
Sect.2]. However, a rigorous proof was not given there.
4. General arguments show that Red∗(P) is countable, see Theorem 8.3.14 below.
Hence, so is . Countability of  is a necessary condition for this set to deﬁne a
stratiﬁcation.
♦
Theorem 8.2.8 will be used in the study of the gauge orbit stratiﬁcation in Sect.8.3
and in the computation of the gauge orbit types in Sects.8.5 and 8.6.
2Clearly, the proposition holds with C∞replaced by any differentiability class.

8.3
The Gauge Orbit Stratiﬁcation
In this section, we discuss the gauge orbit stratiﬁcation in some detail. Our presenta-
tion is along the lines of the work of Kondracki and Rogulski, see [388] for a much
more detailed exposition.
To start with, recall from Sect.6.1 the natural operators
dω ,
d∗
ω ,
Δω = d∗
ω ◦dω ,
□ω = dω ◦d∗
ω + d∗
ω ◦dω ,
depending smoothly on ω and sharing the equivariance property (6.1.15). Also recall
that for dω acting on sections we write ∇ω. The corresponding operators acting
between appropriate Sobolev complections are denoted by the same symbols. By
Theorem 6.1.9, these operators give rise to a natural L2-orthogonal splitting TC =
V ⊕H, where Vω = im(∇ω) and Hω = ker(∇ω∗). Thus,
TωC = im(∇ω) ⊕ker(∇ω∗) .
(8.3.1)
Due to (6.1.15), the distributions V and H are equivariant,
Vω(u) = (Vω)(u) ,
Hω(u) = (Hω)(u) .
(8.3.2)
Consequently, ker(∇ω∗) may be viewed as a model of the tangent space of M at [ω].
This will be made precise in the sequel.
The splitting (8.3.1) will be fundamental for all constructions discussed within
this and the next two sections. In particular, it guarantees that the gauge orbits are
submanifolds, it is basic for the construction of tubes and slices, it provides the ﬁbre
bundle structure on each stratum and it induces natural (weak) Riemannian metrics
on each stratum of the gauge orbit space via a Kaluza-Klein-type construction.
Theorem 8.3.1 (Orbit Theorem) For any ω ∈C , the orbit of ω under the action of
G is a smooth embedded submanifold of C , naturally diffeomorphic to G /Gω.
Proof The orbit mapping ιω : G →C deﬁned by ιω(u) := ω(u) descends to an
injective mapping ˜ιω : G /Gω →C . The latter is smooth, because G →G /Gω is
a locally trivial principal bundle. It is a homeomorphism onto its image, where the
latter is endowed with the relative topology induced from C : this follows from the
properness of the action by the same argument as in the ﬁnite dimensional case,
see Corollary 6.3.5 in Part I. It remains to show that ˜ιω is an immersion, that is, its
tangent mapping at any point is injective and has closed range. Clearly, it sufﬁces to
check this at the point [1] ∈G /Gω, the class of the unit element of G . Choose a local
section s of G →G /Gω in a neighbourhood of [1]. Then, the image Y of T[1]G /Gω
under the tangent mapping s′
[1] is a closed complement of the subspace LGω in LG .
Since
(˜ιω)′
[1] = (ιω)′
1 ◦s′
[1] ,

644

The Gauge Orbit Space
it sufﬁces to show that (ιω)′
1 has closed range and that its restriction to Y is injective.
Using (1.8.7), for ξ ∈LG , we compute
ι′
ωξ = d
dt ↾0
ιω

exp(tξ)

= d
dt ↾0
ω(exp(tξ)) = ∇ωξ .
Thus, closedness follows from the decomposition (8.3.1) and injectivity follows from
the Stabilizer Theorem 6.1.5.
■
Remark 8.3.2 As a consequence of the Orbit Theorem 8.3.1, the vector bundles
T(G · ω) and TC↾G ·ω are smooth subbundles of TC .
♦
A second important consequence of the decomposition (8.3.1) is a Tubular Neigh-
bourhood Theorem for the action of G . As we will see, the local slices are simply
given by the distribution H intersected with local balls in C . The radius of the latter
must be deﬁned in accordance with the Sobolev norm. For that purpose, we use the
strong Riemannian metric γ k on C deﬁned by assigning to ω ∈C the corresponding
Sobolev scalar product given by formula (5.7.8), that is,
γ k
ω(α, β) :=

M

⟨α, β⟩+ ⟨∇˜ωα, ∇˜ωβ⟩+ · · · + ⟨(∇˜ω)kα, (∇˜ω)kβ⟩
	
vg ,
(8.3.3)
where α, β ∈TωC = Wk(T∗M ⊗Ad(P)) and ˜ω = ω0 + ω with ω0 denoting the
Levi-Civita connection of the metric g on M. Due to ∇ω(u) = Ad(u−1)◦∇ω ◦Ad(u) ,
the metric γ k is G -invariant,
γ k
ω(u)

α(u), β(u)
= γ k
ω(α, β) ,
where α(u) = Ad(u−1)α according to (8.2.2). Putting k = 0 in (8.3.3), we obtain the
natural weak Riemannian metric γ 0 ≡γ corresponding to the L2-scalar product.
The following theorem is a generalization of the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem
6.4.3 of Part I to the inﬁnite-dimensional context under consideration. Except for the
use of an invariant metric, the idea of the proof is the same. The notions of tubular
neighbourhood and slice, introduced in Deﬁnition I/6.4.1, carry over in an obvious
way.
Theorem 8.3.3 (Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem) Every gauge orbit admits a
tubular neighbourhood.
Proof Let π : C →M be the canonical projection. By (8.3.1), for any x ∈M , the
normal bundle of the orbit π−1(x) may be identiﬁed with
Nx = H↾π−1(x) .
According to (8.3.2), Nx is equivariant. This, together with the local triviality of the
projection G →G /Gω, implies that Nx is a smooth locally trivial vector subbundle
of TC ↾π−1(x). For ε > 0, consider the smooth subbundle

8.3 The Gauge Orbit Stratiﬁcation

Nx,ε :=

(ω, α) ∈Nx :

of Nx.3 Due to the G -invariance of γ k, Nx,ε is equivariant. As G -manifolds, Nx and
Nx,ε are equivariantly diffeomorphic through the rescaling mapping
ρε : Nx →Nx,ε ,
(ω, α) →

ω,
ε

γ kω(α, α) + 1


(8.3.4)
(Exercise 8.3.2). By restriction, the mapping
exp : TC →C ,
(ω, α) →ω + α ,
which is in fact the exponential mapping with respect to the L2-metric, deﬁnes a
smooth G -equivariant mapping Nx,ε →C . The image is
Ux,ε =

ω + α ∈C : π(ω) = x , (ω, α) ∈Nx,ε

.
(8.3.5)
Clearly, Ux,ε is open in C and G -invariant. Moreover, by the same argument as in the
proof of the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem 6.4.3 of Part I, one can show that there
exists ε > 0 such that the restriction of exp to Nx,ε ⊂TC is injective. Consequently,
the composition
exp ◦ρε : Nx →C
(8.3.6)
is an equivariant diffeomorphism onto Ux,ε, that is, it deﬁnes a tubular neighbourhood
of the gauge orbit π−1(x).
■
In the following, whenever we write Ux,ε or Sω,ε, it is understood that ε is small
enough to make the subset a tubular neighbourhood or a slice, respectively.
Remark 8.3.4 (Slices) As a consequence of the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem
8.3.3, the action of G on C admits a slice at every point ω ∈C . According to (8.3.5),
this slice is given by the subset
Sω,ε :=

ω + α ∈C : (ω, α) ∈Nx,ε

(8.3.7)
of Ux,ε. By construction, Sω,ε obeys the deﬁning properties of a slice (Exercise
8.3.1):
1. Ux,ε = G · Sω,ε,
2. Sω,ε is closed in Ux,ε,
3Note that Nx,ε is not just the ε-disk bundle of Nx, because orthogonality and length are taken with
respect to different metrics.

The Gauge Orbit Space
3. Sω,ε is invariant under the stabilizer Gω,
4. For any u ∈G , if

Sω,ε
(u) ∩Sω,ε ̸= ∅, then u ∈Gω.
Since Sω,ε is an open subset of the closed afﬁne subspace ω + Hω of C , for every
ω′ ∈Sω,ε, the tangent space is given by Tω′Sω,ε = Hω. Consequently,
TSω,ε = Sω,ε × Hω .
(8.3.8)
For further use, let us draw the following conclusion from this observation. Since
Uω,ε is generated from Sω,ε by the action of G , for every ω′ ∈Sω,ε we have
Tω′Sω,ε + Tω′(G · ω′) = Tω′Uω,ε = T , where the sum need not be direct, as Gω′
may be strictly smaller than Gω. Thus, for all ω′ ∈Sω,ε,
Hω + Vω′ = T .
(8.3.9)
♦
Remark 8.3.5 (Local Slice Theorem) The authors of [388] actually prove more: they
show that for any x ∈M and any open invariant neighbourhood U of π−1(x) in
C there exists ε > 0 such that Ux,ε ⊂U and U \ Ux,ε ̸= ∅. They call this
the Local Slice Theorem. As a consequence, M is a regular topological space,
meaning that whenever one has a closed subset V and a point x /∈V, then there
exists a neighbourhood of x , whose closure in M does not intersect V. According to
Urysohn's metrization theorem, regularity in combination with second countability
(which is due to the separability of C ) then implies that M is a metrizable space. ♦
Theorem 8.3.3 has the following immediate consequence.
Corollary 8.3.6 For every stabilizer S and every orbit type τ, the following subsets
are open:
C S in C ≤S ,
C τ in C ≤τ ,
M τ in M ≤τ .
Proof This is a consequence of the fact that property 4 of slice implies that
Ux,ε ⊂C ≥τ ,
Sω,ε ⊂C ≥S
(8.3.10)
for any x ∈M τ and any ω ∈C S. Indeed, let ω ∈C S. Since Uπ(ω),ε is a neighbour-
hood of ω in C , its intersection with C ≤S is a neighbourhood of ω in C ≤S. Due to
(8.3.10), the intersection is contained in
C ≥S ∩C ≤S = C S .
The argument applies without change to C τ. For M τ it sufﬁces to note that Ux,ε
projects to a neighbourhood of x in M .
■
It is well known that the connections with trivial stabilizer are dense in C , see
[591]. More generally, the question arises, whether C τ is dense in C ≤τ, that is, in

8.3 The Gauge Orbit Stratiﬁcation
647
other words, whether a connection with nontrivial stabilizer can be approximated by
connections with a prescribed, strictly smaller stabilizer. The answer is given by the
following result of Kondracki and Rogulski [388].
Theorem 8.3.7 (Approximation Theorem) Assume dim M ≥2. Let ω ∈C and let
Q be a connected bundle reduction of P to a (not necessarily closed) Lie subgroup.
Assume that Q contains a holonomy bundle of ω. Then, there exists α ∈T such that
all ω + tα, t ∈R \ {0}, have holonomy bundle Q.
■
Corollary 8.3.8 For every stabilizer S and every orbit type τ, the following subsets
are dense:
C S in C ≤S ,
C τ in C ≤τ ,
M τ in M ≤τ .
(8.3.11)
Proof Choose a point p0 ∈P. Let ω ∈C ≤S. Then, S ⊂Gω and hence Φp0(Gω) ⊂
Φp0(S). By Lemma 8.2.2, then Φp0(S) contains the holonomy bundle Pp0(ω). Of
course, so does the connected component (Φp0(S))p0 of Φp0(S) containing p0. Thus,
Theorem 8.3.7 yields that ω can be approximated by connections with holonomy
bundle (Φp0(S))p0. Since Φp0(S) is holonomy-induced, it is induced via (8.2.11) by
(Φp0(S))p0. Hence, all connections with holonomy bundle (Φp0(S))p0 have stabilizer
S. This shows that C S is dense in C ≤S. Then, denseness of C τ in C ≤τ and denseness
of M τ in M ≤τ follow.
■
Remark 8.3.9
1. Corollaries 8.3.6 and 8.3.8 imply that C S, C τ and M τ are generic subsets of,
respectively, C ≤S, C ≤τ and M ≤τ.
2. For every orbit type τ,
C τ = C ≤τ ,
M τ = M ≤τ .
(8.3.12)
The inclusions from right to left are obvious from Corollary 8.3.8. The converse
inclusions follow from the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem: let ω ∈C τ. Con-
sider Uω,ε ∩C τ. Since this is a neighbourhood of ω in C τ, it contains some
ω′ ∈C τ. According to (8.3.10), then τ is greater than or equal to the type of ω.
Thus, ω ∈C ≤τ. The inclusion for M τ then follows by noting that for saturated
sets like C τ, closure and projection commute.
3. Similarly, for stabilizers S one has
C S = C ≤S .
(8.3.13)
While the inclusion from right to left is again due to Corollary 8.3.8, the converse
inclusion can be proved without the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem by the
following simple argument. For any u ∈G , deﬁne a mapping
ϕu : C →T ,
ϕu(ω) := ω(u) −ω .

648
8
The Gauge Orbit Space
Since these mappings are continuous, the subsets ϕ−1
u (0) are closed in C . Then
C ≤S = 
u∈S ϕ−1
u (0) is closed. Hence, C S ⊂C ≤S.
♦
Next, we study the projections
πτ : C τ →M τ
induced from π : C →M . We will see that they can be equipped with the structure
of smooth locally trivial ﬁbre bundles. As a result, in a sense, π ﬁbres over the set
of orbit types into such bundles.
We start by showing that the conﬁguration space strata are submanifolds. For any
ω ∈C τ, deﬁne
S τ
ω,ε := Sω,ε ∩C τ ,
(8.3.14)
Hτ
ω := {α ∈Hω : Gα ⊃Gω} ,
(8.3.15)
Hτ
ω,ε := {α ∈Hτ
ω :

γ k(α, α) < ε} .
Due to (8.3.10), for all ω′ ∈S τ
ω,ε, we have
Gω′ = Gω .
(8.3.16)
Proposition 8.3.10 For every orbit type τ and every stabilizer S, C τ and C S are
smooth submanifolds of C .
Proof To prove that C τ is a submanifold of C , it sufﬁces to show that for any x ∈M τ
the subset
U τ
x,ε := Ux,ε ∩C τ
is a submanifold of Ux,ε. By (8.3.16),
S τ
ω,ε = {ω + α ∈Sω,ε : Gω+α = Gω} .
Since Gω+α = Gω iff Gα ⊃Gω, then
S τ
ω,ε = {ω + α ∈C : α ∈Hτ
ω,ε}
(8.3.17)
and thus
U τ
x,ε = {ω + α ∈C : ω ∈π−1(x) , α ∈Hτ
ω,ε} .
Therefore, the preimage of U τ
x,ε under the equivariant diffeomorphism (8.3.6) is the
vector subbundle
Nτ
x =

ω∈π−1(x)
Hτ
ω

8.3 The Gauge Orbit Stratiﬁcation
649
of Nx. Since Nτ
x is equivariant and since its ﬁbres are closed subspaces of T , it is
a smooth subbundle of TC↾π−1(x) and hence of Nx. By the Tubular Neighbourhood
Theorem, it follows that U τ
x,ε is a smooth submanifold of Ux,ε, for any x ∈M τ. As
a result, C τ is a submanifold of C , as asserted.
To prove that C S is a submanifold of C , we observe that C ≤S is a closed afﬁne
subspace of C with translation vector space given by the closed subspace {α ∈T :
Gα ⊃S} of T . Thus, the assertion follows from Corollary 8.3.6.
■
Remark 8.3.11
1. The vector subbundle Nτ
x is in fact trivial, with a smooth trivialization given by
G /Gω × Hτ
ω →Nτ
x ,
([u], α) →(ω(u), α(u)) ,
for some ω ∈π−1(x). Note that this mapping is well deﬁned precisely because
Gα ⊃Gω. It follows that U τ
x,ε also has a direct product structure. This can be
made explicit by introducing mappings
χτ
ω,ε : S τ
ω,ε × G /Gω →U τ
π(ω),ε ,
(ω′, [u]) →ω′(u) ,
(8.3.18)
which are easily seen to be diffeomorphisms. Note that, for obvious reasons, the
roles of ﬁbre and base are interchanged here.
2. Clearly, Hτ
ω is a closed subspace of C for every ω ∈C τ. Hence, by (8.3.17), the
partial slice S τ
ω,ε is an open subset of the closed afﬁne subspace ω + Hτ
ω of C .
By analogy with the case of the full slice Sω,ε in Remark 8.3.4, this implies
TS τ
ω,ε = S τ
ω,ε × Hτ
ω .
(8.3.19)
♦
Proposition 8.3.12 For every orbit type τ, the following hold true.
1. M τ is a smooth manifold.
2. C τ has the structure of a locally trivial ﬁbre bundle over M τ with typical ﬁbre
G /Gω, where ω ∈C τ.
Proof We shall construct an atlas of the stratum M τ using the partial slices S τ
ω,ε,
ω ∈C τ. For any x ∈M τ, deﬁne
V τ
x,ε := π(U τ
x,ε) .
This is is an open subset of M τ, because V τ
x,ε = M τ ∩π(Ux,ε) and π(Ux,ε) is open
in M . By restriction in domain and range, for any ω ∈π−1(x), π deﬁnes a mapping
πτ
ω,ε : S τ
ω,ε →V τ
x,ε .
(8.3.20)

650
8
The Gauge Orbit Space
By (8.3.16), we have that πτ
ω,ε is bijective. We show that it is open and hence a
homeomorphism onto V τ
x,ε. Let U ⊂S τ
ω,ε be open. Then, U = S τ
ω,ε ∩U′, where
U′ ⊂Sω,ε is open. Using a local trivialization of the normal bundle Nx, one can
check that the saturation ˜U′ = U′(G ) is open in Ux,ε and hence in C . Therefore,
π( ˜U′) is open in M . Using (8.3.10) and the fact that ˜U′ is saturated, we obtain
π(U) = π(S τ
ω,ε ∩˜U′) = π(S τ
ω,ε) ∩π( ˜U′) = V τ
x,ε ∩π( ˜U′) ,
which shows that π(U) is open in V τ
x,ε. Hence, (8.3.20) is a homeomorphism, indeed.
Combining this with the observation of Remark 8.3.11/2 that the partial slices S τ
ω,ε
are open subsets of closed afﬁne subspaces of C , we conclude that the family
(V τ
π(ω),ε, (πτ
ω,ε)−1), ω ∈C τ, provides a covering of M τ by local charts (one can
make this more explicit by further mapping S τ
ω,ε →Hτ
ω,ε).
It remains to check that the transition mappings between these charts are smooth.
Due to (8.3.18), for any ω1, ω2 ∈C τ, we have a diffeomorphism

χτ
ω2,ε2
−1 ◦χτ
ω1,ε1 : S τ
ω1,ε1 ∩U τ
π(ω2),ε2 × G /Gω1 −→S τ
ω2,ε2 ∩U τ
π(ω1),ε1 × G /Gω2 .
Now, the transition mapping

πτ
ω2,ε2
−1 ◦πτ
ω1,ε1 is given by the composition of the
embedding ω′ →(ω′, [1]), the above diffeomorphism, and projection to the ﬁrst
component. Hence, it is smooth. Thus, the atlas we have constructed equips M τ
with the structure of a smooth Hilbert manifold. This proves the ﬁrst assertion.
To prove the second assertion, we observe that the local diffeomorphisms χτ
ω,ε
deﬁne local diffeomorphisms
V τ
π(ω),ε × G /Gω
(πτ
ω,ε)−1×id
−−−−−−→S τ
π(ω),ε × G /Gω
χτ

−−→U τ
π(ω),ε .
These mappings provide a covering of C τ by local trivializations of the projection
πτ : C τ →M τ. Thus, the latter is a smooth locally trivial ﬁbre bundle with typical
ﬁbre G /Gω.
■
Remark 8.3.13 Let us consider, in particular, the principal orbit type τ = τp, which is
theconjugacyclassconsistingofthesubgroup ˜Z(G)ofconstantfunctionsP →Z(G),
where Z(G) denotes the center of G. Since ˜Z(G) is normal in G , the smooth locally
trivial ﬁbre bundle
πp : C p →M p
is in fact principal, with structure group 
G := G /˜Z(G). This bundle has been studied
intensively [454, 455, 476, 591]. An important aspect is that the nontriviality of this
bundle is an obstruction to the existence of smooth (or even continuous) gauges
[591]. This explains the Gribov ambiguity [258] in geometric terms, see Sect.9.2 for
a detailed discussion.
For the other orbit types, representatives S are not normal in G . In order to have
a similar picture as in the case of the principal stratum, one would have to take the

8.3 The Gauge Orbit Stratiﬁcation
651
submanifold C S of connections with stabilizer S. C S is acted upon freely by N/S,
where N denotes the normalizer of S in G . Provided one could show that N is a Lie
subgroup of G (a problem which, to our knowledge, has not been solved yet) the
projection πS : C S →M τ would be a smooth locally trivial principal ﬁbre bundle
and πτ : C τ →M τ would be associated with this bundle via the action of N/S on
G /S.
♦
In the remainder, we discuss the properties of the decomposition of M into the
orbit type subsets M τ. Following the terminology of Kondracki and Rogulski [388],4
a stratiﬁcation of a topological space X is a countable disjoint decomposition into
smooth manifolds Xi, called the strata, such that for all i, i′ the frontier condition
holds:
Xi ∩Xi′ ̸= ∅
⇒
Xi ⊂Xi′ .
As this notion is rather weak, one usually adds additional assumptions about the
linking between the strata, thus arriving at special types of stratiﬁcation. According
to[388],thetypeofstratiﬁcationappropriatehereisdeﬁnedbytheadditionalproperty
Xi ∩Xi′ ̸= ∅
⇒
Xi closed in Xi ∪Xi′ .
Such a stratiﬁcation is called regular.
The following result belongs to Kondracki and Rogulski [388].
Theorem 8.3.14 (Stratiﬁcation Theorem) The decomposition of M by orbit types
is a regular stratiﬁcation.
Proof We ﬁrst check countability of orbit types. By Theorem 8.2.8, orbit types are in
one-to-one correspondence with certain reductions of P to Howe subgroups, modulo
isomorphy of the reductions and modulo conjugacy of the subgroups. In view of this,
the following facts ensure countability:
(a) Howe subgroups are closed.
(b) There are at most countably many conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in a
compact Lie group [383].5
(c) There are at most countably many isomorphism classes of principal bundles
with a given compact structure group G over a given manifold M: by Theorem
3.4.23, these classes are in one-to-one correspondence with homotopy classes of
mappings from M to the classifying space BG. Since both M and BG can be given
a CW-complex structure and since that of M is ﬁnite, the Cellular Approximation
Theorem implies that there are at most countably many such classes.
4See the remarks on the notion of stratiﬁcation in Sect.6.6 of Part I.
5Let us note that the number of Howe subgroups in a compact Lie group is actually ﬁnite. This
follows from the fact that any centralizer in a compact Lie group is generated by ﬁnitely many
elements [92, Chap. 9] and that a compact group action on a compact manifold has a ﬁnite number
of orbit types [103].

The Gauge Orbit Space
It remains to prove the frontier and regularity conditions. Let τ, τ ′ be orbit types such
that M τ ∩M τ ′ ̸= ∅. According to the closure formula (8.3.12), M τ is a union of
strata. If M τ ′ intersects this union, then it must in fact coincide with one of these
strata. This implies M τ ′ ⊂M τ. Thus, the frontier condition is fulﬁlled.
On the other hand, by Corollary 8.3.6, M τ is open in M ≤τ and hence in M τ. Then
M τ is open in M τ ∪M τ ′, because the latter is a subset of M τ due to the frontier
condition. Then M τ ′, being the complement, is closed. Hence, the decomposition
by orbit types is a regular stratiﬁcation.
■
Remark 8.3.15
1. Deﬁne a relation ≥on the set of strata by
M τ ≥M τ ′
⇔
M τ ∩M τ ′ ̸= ∅.
Clearly, this relation is reﬂexive. By the frontier condition, it is transitive and thus
a quasi-ordering (the natural quasi-ordering of the stratiﬁcation). By the regularity
condition, it is also anti-symmetric and hence a partial ordering. By construction,
M τ ≥M τ ′ iff τ ≥τ ′. That is, the natural partial ordering of strata is compatible
with the natural partial ordering of orbit types.
2. Instead of using Sobolev techniques one can also stick to smooth connection
forms and gauge transformations. Then one obtains essentially analogous results
about the stratiﬁcation of the corresponding gauge orbit space where, roughly
speaking, one has to replace 'Hilbert manifold' and 'Hilbert Lie group' by 'tame
Fréchet manifold' and 'tame Fréchet Lie group', see [1, 2].

8.4
Geometry of Strata
In this section, we will show that the weak Riemannian metric γ 0 on C induces a
weak Riemannian metric on each stratum M τ. This was discussed for the case of the
principal stratum in [47, 592] and for the general case in [75]. The basic idea consists
in restricting the tangent bundle splitting TC = V ⊕H given by Theorem 6.1.9 to
the strata. This yields a natural smooth connection on each bundle which allows to
lift tangent vectors, thus projecting γ 0 to a metric on each stratum. By restriction, the
distribution V made up by the tangent spaces of the orbits induces a distribution Vτ
on C τ. Contrary to V, Vτ is smooth and locally trivial, because Vτ = ker((πτ)′)
and πτ is a smooth submersion. Let Hτ denote the distribution orthogonal to Vτ with
respect to γ 0. By construction,

8.4 Geometry of Strata
653
Hτ = H ∩TC τ ,
and, thus, we have the L2-orthogonal splitting
TC τ = Vτ ⊕Hτ .
(8.4.1)
Moreover, by (8.3.2), Hτ is G -equivariant,
Hτ
ω(u) =

Hτ
ω
(u) ,
u ∈G .
We draw the attention of the reader to the fact that we had already introduced the
notation Hτ
ω for the subspace of Hω consisting of elements invariant under Gω, see
(8.3.15). This notation suggests that Hτ
ω is in fact the ﬁbre at ω of the distribution
Hτ. To see that this holds indeed, recall that Hω = TωSω,ε. Hence, the ﬁbre of Hτ is
TωSω,ε ∩TωC τ = TωS τ
ω,ε .
According to (8.3.19), the right hand side is given by Hτ
ω.
Proposition 8.4.1 The distribution Hτ is smooth.
Proof Recall from Theorem 6.1.9 that the orthogonal projectors onto Vω and Hω
are given by
vω = ∇ωGω∇ω∗,
hω = id −vω ,
respectively, where Gω is the Green's operator of Δω. To prove that Hτ is smooth it
is enough to show that the restriction of v to TC τ ⊂TC is smooth. By restriction,
v induces a mapping (denoted by the same symbol)
v : C τ →B(T ) ,
ω →vω := ∇ωGω∇ω∗,
where B(T ) denotes the Banach space of bounded operators on T . Since the diag-
onal embedding C τ →C τ × C τ × C τ is smooth and since ∇ω and ∇ω∗depend
smoothly on ω, it sufﬁces to prove the smoothness of the mapping
C τ →B(Wk−1(Ad(P)), Wk+1(Ad(P))) ,
ω →Gω .
(8.4.2)
Pulling the latter back with a local trivialization χτ
ω0,ε, ω0 ∈C τ, see (8.3.18), we
obtain a mapping
S τ
ω0,ε × G /Gω0 →B(Wk−1(Ad(P)), Wk+1(Ad(P))) ,
(ω, [u]) →Gω(u) , (8.4.3)
which is well deﬁned, because Gω = Gω0 for all ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε. Due to (6.1.29), this
mapping is smooth along G /Gω0. Thus, what we actually have to show is that the
restrictions of the mapping (8.4.2) to the partial slices S τ
ω0,ε, ω0 ∈C τ, are smooth.

The Gauge Orbit Space
For that purpose, recall from (5.7.34) that Gω is constructed from the (bounded)
inverse of the operator
Δω : ker(Δω)⊥→im(Δω) .
(8.4.4)
Due to Gω = Gω0, the Stabilizer Theorem 6.1.5, Eq.(6.1.23) and the Hodge Decom-
position Theorem 5.7.18, we have
ker(Δω) = ker(Δω0) ,
im(Δω) = im(Δω0) .
(8.4.5)
Hence, (8.4.4) reads
Δω : ker(Δω0)⊥→im(Δω0) ,
for all ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε. Thus, the mapping under consideration decomposes into
S τ
ω0,ε
Δ
−→inv

ker(Δω0)⊥, im(Δω0)

inv
−→inv

im(Δω0), ker(Δω0)⊥
,
followed by prolongation to a bounded operator Wk−1(Ad(P)) →Wk+1(Ad(P)).
Here inv(·, ·) ⊂B(·, ·) denotes the open subset of invertible bounded operators and
inv stands for the inversion mapping. Since the ﬁrst step factorizes into continuous
linear mappings and composition of bounded operators and since the inversion map-
ping of linear operators is smooth, we conclude that the restrictions of the mapping
(8.4.2) to the partial slices S τ
ω0,ε are smooth, indeed.
■
Next, we show that the distribution Hτ on C τ is locally trivial. For that purpose,
recall that, due to (8.3.10), Sω0,ε is transversal to any orbit in C τ it meets. Hence,
Hω0 ∩Vω = ker(∇ω0∗) ∩im(∇ω) = {0}
(8.4.6)
and thus (8.3.9) implies that we have a direct sum decomposition
T = Hω0 ⊕Vω = ker(∇ω0∗) ⊕im(∇ω)
(8.4.7)
for all ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε. Consider the mapping
Δω0ω : Wk+1(Ad(P)) →Wk−1(Ad(P)) ,
Δω0ω := ∇ω0∗∇ω .
(8.4.8)
It will be referred to as the Faddeev-Popov operator. Let us construct the correspond-
ing Green's operator. By (8.4.6), we have ker(Δω0ω) = ker(∇ω). Since Gω = Gω0,
the Stabilizer Theorem 6.1.5 implies ker(∇ω) = ker(∇ω0) = ker(Δω0). Thus,
ker(Δω0ω) = ker(Δω0) .
On the other hand, by (8.4.7),
im(Δω0ω) = im(∇ω0∗) = im(Δω0) .

8.4 Geometry of Strata
655
As a consequence, by restriction, Δω0ω induces an isomorphism (denoted by the
same symbol)
Δω0ω : ker(Δω0)⊥→im(Δω0) .
Consequently, we can deﬁne a Green's operator
Gω0ω : Wk−1(Ad(P)) →Wk+1(Ad(P))
similar to Gω0 and Gω. Then,
Gω0ωΔω0ω = Gω0Δω0 = GωΔω ,
because Gω0ωΔω0ω is the identical mapping on ker(Δω0)⊥and trivial on ker(Δω0),
and ker(Δω0) = ker(Δω). Similarly,
Δω0ωGω0ω = Δω0Gω0 ,
because Δω0ωGω0ω is the identical mapping on im(Δω0) and trivial on im(Δω0)⊥.
Lemma 8.4.2 Let ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε. Then,
1. the Faddeev-Popov operator Δω0ω is formally self-adjoint,
2. the operator
vω0ω := ∇ωGω0ω∇ω0∗
(8.4.9)
is the projector onto the subspace Vω = im(∇ω) in the decomposition (8.4.7).
Proof Using the Ad-invariance of the L2-scalar product, for any ξ ∈Wk+1(Ad(P))
and η ∈Wk−1(Ad(P)), we calculate

Since ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε, the right hand side vanishes. To prove the second assertion, we use
that Gω0ωΔω0ω is the identical mapping on ker(Δω0)⊥. Since ker(Δω0)⊥= im(Gω0ω),
this implies
v2
ω0ω = ∇ωGω0ωΔω0ωGω0ω∇ω0∗= vω0ω ,
showing that vω0ω is a projector. Since ker(Δω0) = ker(∇ω), this furthermore implies
vω0ω(∇ωξ) = ∇ωGω0ωΔω0ωξ = ∇ωξ ,

656

The Gauge Orbit Space
showing that im(vω0ω) = im(∇ω). Since vω0ω acts trivially on ker(∇ω0∗), it is the
projector onto the subspace im(∇ω) in the decomposition (8.4.7), indeed.
■
Remark 8.4.3 Correspondingly, hω0ω := 1−vω0ω is the projector onto the subspace
Hω0 = ker(∇ω0∗) in the decomposition (8.4.7). Associated with vω0ω and hω0ω, we
have their adjoints,
v∗
ω0ω = ∇ω0Gω0ω∇ω∗,
h∗
ω0ω = 1 −v∗
ω0ω = 1 −∇ω0Gω0ω∇ω∗,
which are the projectors onto Vω0 and Hω, respectively. By (6.1.26),
hω0ωhω = hω0hω0ω = hω0ω ,
hω0ωhω0 = hω0 ,
hωhω0ω = hω ,

(8.4.11)
for all ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε. Similar formulae hold for v.
♦
Now, for ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε, consider the induced action of Gω = Gω0 on TωC τ. It leaves
the decomposition
TωC τ = Vω ⊕Hτ
ω
invariant. Moroever, it leaves Hτ
ω invariant pointwise. Hence, denoting the subspace
of the Gω-invariant elements of Vω by ˆVω, we have the decomposition

TωC τGω0 = ˆVω ⊕Hτ
ω .
In particular, this decomposition holds for ω = ω0. By point 2 of Lemma 8.4.2 and
the equivariance property (6.1.30), vω0ω induces an isomorphism
ˆvω0ω : ˆVω0 →ˆVω .
(8.4.12)
Correspondingly, hω0ω induces an isomorphism
ˆhω0ω : Hτ
ω →Hτ
ω0 .
(8.4.13)
Clearly, the projectors vω0ω and hω0ω deﬁne a splitting of the restriction of the tangent
bundle of the stratum to the slice S τ
ω0,ε. We will now see that these splittings yield
a system of local trivializations of the vector bundle Hτ.
Proposition 8.4.4 The distribution Hτ is a locally trivial subbundle of TC τ.
Proof To construct a local trivialization of Hτ, choose ω0 ∈C τ and consider the
distribution Dτ
ω0,ε on S τ
ω0,ε × G /Gω0, made up by the subspaces tangent to S τ
ω0,ε.
Due to (8.3.19), it is trivial. We claim that the mapping

is a smooth vector bundle isomorphism and, thus, provides a local trivialization of
Hτ. By equivariance of (χτ
ω0,ε)′ and h, it sufﬁces to show that the mapping

↾S τω0,ε ,

is a smooth vector bundle isomorphism. By the same argument as in the proof of
Proposition 8.4.1, one can show that the mapping
S τ
ω0,ε →B(T ) ,
ω →hω0ω ,
is smooth. Moreover, by (8.4.10), for α ∈Hτ
ω0, one ﬁnds hω0ωhωα = hω0ωα = α .
Hence, the mapping
Hτ
↾S τω0,ε →S τ
ω0,ε × Hτ

(ω, α) →

provides a smooth inverse of (8.4.15).
■
Remark 8.4.5 Associated with the distribution H there is an equivariant differential
form Z on C with values in LG given by
Z(ω, α) := Gω∇ω∗α ,
(ω, α) ∈C × T = TC .
(8.4.16)
By deﬁnition, Zω annihilates the elements of Hω. If ω belongs to the principal stratum
C p, we have
Z(ω, ∇ωξ) = ξ
(8.4.17)
for all ξ ∈LG , showing that Z restricts to an ordinary connection form on the
principal bundle C p →M p. For ω in another stratum, however, Zω maps the value
at ω of the Killing ﬁeld generated by ξ to the projection of ξ onto the L2-orthogonal
complement of LGω in LG . We will comment on that below.
♦
The natural connection Hτ and the (weak) Riemannian metric γ = γ 0 induce a
Riemannian metric γ τ on M τ as follows. Due to the Open Mapping Theorem, the
restriction of (πτ)′ to a ﬁbre Hτ
ω, ω ∈C τ, induces a Banach space isomorphism
onto Tπ(ω)M τ. This allows to lift tangent vectors at x ∈M τ to horizontal tangent
vectors at ω ∈π−1(x) and to evaluate their scalar product with respect to γ . Due to
equivariance of Hτ and invariance of γ , the result does not depend on the choice of
the representative ω. Due to smoothness of Hτ, the Riemannian metric γ τ on M τ
so constructed is smooth.
Let us determine the local representatives of γ τ in the charts provided by the slices
S τ
ω0,ε, cf. (8.3.20). Let ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε. For (ω, αi) ∈TωS τ
ω0,ε = S τ

The Z-horizontal lifts of (πτ

(8.4.18)
By (8.4.10),
⟨α1, hωα2⟩L2 = ⟨α1, hω0hωhω0α2⟩L2 .
Since, by restriction, hω deﬁnes an isomorphisms
ˆhω : Hτ
ω0 →Hτ
ω ,
(8.4.19)
in the chart provided by the slice S τ
ω0,ε, the metric is given by the smooth mapping

ω →γ τ
ω := ˆhω0 ˆhω ˆhω0 .



(8.4.21)
Thus, in particular, γ τ
ω is a Banach space isomorphism.
Remark 8.4.6 (Kaluza-Klein-type structure) For every orbit type τ, the restriction
of the G -invariant L2-metric γ to C τ is uniquely characterized by the triple

γ τ, Z, ⟨·, ·⟩LG

,
where ⟨·, ·⟩LG denotes the L2-scalar product on LG . This is a structure similar to
that in Kaluza-Klein theory, cf. Proposition 7.8.3, where K-invariant metrics g on a
K-bundle Q with ﬁbre K/H over the manifold M are in one-to-one correspondence
with triples (gM, ξ, ⟨·, ·⟩) . Here gM is a metric on M , ξ is a connection form on the
principal bundle P with structure group N/H associated with Q and ⟨·, ·⟩is an Ad(K)-
invariant scalar product on the Lie algebra of K. Moreover, N denotes the normalizer
of H in K . According to Remark 8.3.13, in the case under consideration, it is unclear
whether the normalizer of a given stabilizer Gω in G is a Lie subgroup. Thus, we
cannot construct the above associated principal bundle and give an interpretation of
Z as a connection form on this bundle. Such an interpretation is only possible on the
principal stratum.
♦
Let us write down the formal volume element of the metric γ τ on M τ in the local
charts provided by the slices S τ
ω0,ε. This generalizes a result for the generic stratum
due to Babelon and Viallet [46]. Recall that Δω0 maps the orthogonal complement of
ker(Δω0) in Wk+1(Ad(P)) isomorphically onto im(Δω0), which by (6.1.21) coincides
with the L2-orthogonal complement of ker(Δω0) in Wk−1(Ad(P)). Thus, we may
view Δω0 as an operator on the closed subspace im(Δω0) of Wk−1(Ad(P)) which is
densely deﬁned and which has an inverse, given by the Green's operator Gω0. Since
ker(Δω) = ker(Δω0ω) = ker(Δω0), this applies also to Δω and the Faddeev-Popov
operator Δω0ω, as well as the corresponding Green's operators. By equivariance, all

8.4 Geometry of Strata
659
these operators restrict to operators on the subspace im(Δω0)Gω0 of Gω0-invariants.
Let us denote the restricted operators by ˆΔω0, ˆΔω, ˆΔω0ω, and ˆGω0, ˆGω, ˆGω0ω. The
following expression is formal in the sense that the determinants involved have to be
regularized. For the regularization of determinants, we refer to Appendix D.
Proposition 8.4.7 In the local chart deﬁned by a slice S τ
ω0,ε, the formal volume
element at ω ∈S τ
ω0,ε of the metric γ τ on M τ is given by
det

γ τ
ω
1/2 =
det( ˆΔω0ω)
det( ˆΔω0)1/2 det( ˆΔω)1/2 .
(8.4.22)
Proof Deﬁne a mapping χ : T →T by χ := hω0vω. Then, χ∗= vωhω0 and hence
(1 −χχ∗)↾Hτω0 = (1 −hω0vωhω0)↾Hτω0 = (hω0hωhω0)↾Hτω0 = ˆhω0 ˆhω ˆhω0 .
Therefore,
γ τ
ω = (1 −χχ∗)↾Hτω0 .
(8.4.23)
On the other hand, consider the isomorphism
φ : im(Δω0)Gω0 →im(Δω0)Gω0 ,
φ := ˆGω ˆΔ∗
ω0ω ˆGω0 ˆΔω0ω .
Using that the Faddeev-Popov operator is self-adjoint, we obtain
det (φ) =
det( ˆΔω0ω)2
det( ˆΔω0) det( ˆΔω)
.
(8.4.24)
Next, by (8.4.16),
Zω∇ω =

Gω∇ω∗∇ω
↾im(Δω0) = idim(Δω0) ,
and
∇ωZω = (∇ωGω∇ω∗)↾Vω = vω↾Vω = idVω .
We conclude that Zω : Vω →im(Δω0) is an isomorphism inverse to ∇ω. By equivari-
ance, Zω and ∇ω induce mutually inverse isomorphisms
ˆZω :
ˆVω →im(Δω0)Gω0 ,
ˆ∇ω : im(Δω0)Gω0 →ˆVω .
Thus,
˜φ := ˆ∇ωφ ˆZω :
ˆVω →ˆVω
is an isomorphism. We compute

The Gauge Orbit Space
(1 −χ∗χ)↾ˆVω = (1 −vωhω0vω)↾ˆVω = (vωvω0vω)↾ˆVω = ˆ∇ωφ ˆZω .
Thus,
˜φ = (1 −χ∗χ)↾ˆVω .

Now,assumethatu ∈ˆVω isaneigenvectorofχ∗χ withanonzeroeigenvalueλ.Then,
χχ∗(χu) = λ(χu) and χu ̸= 0. Thus, χu is an eigenvector of χχ∗with the same
eigenvalue λ. Moreover, χu ∈Hτ
ω0. Consequently, χ deﬁnes isomorphisms between
the eigenspaces of (χ∗χ)↾ˆVω and (χχ∗)↾Hτω0 corresponding to nonzero eigenvalues.
Thus, by (8.4.23) and (8.4.25),
det(γ τ
ω) = det

This yields the assertion.
■
Remark 8.4.8
1. In the case of the principal stratum M p, we have ker(Δω0) = 0 and LGω0 = 0.
Thus, by the Hodge Theorem, im(Δω0)Gω0 = Wk+1(Ad(P)) and (8.4.22) repro-
duces the formula given in [46]:
det

γ p

1/2 =
det(Δω0ω)
det(Δω0)1/2 det(Δω)1/2 .
(8.4.26)
2. Since the Faddeev-Popov operator is not elliptic, the standard ζ-function regu-
larization procedure for determinants of elliptic operators on compact manifolds
as summarized in Appendix D does not apply directly. However, it can be shown
[506] that this procedure may be extended to a larger class of operators including
the Faddeev-Popov operator.
♦
Next, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor of γ τ. This is again a generalization
of a result of Babelon and Viallet for the principal stratum, see [47]. Our proof
will be along the lines of Groisser and Parker [262] who use the O'Neill Formula
for a Riemannian submersion [495]. Indeed, by construction of γ τ, the canonical
projection π : C τ →M τ is a Riemannian submersion, that is, it has maximal rank
and it preserves the length of horizontal vectors. For α ∈T , deﬁne an operator
Cα : Ωp(M, Ad(P)) →Ωp+1(M, Ad(P)) ,
Cα(β) := [α, β]
(8.4.27)
and let C∗
α denote the adjoint with respect to the L2-scalar product. Then,
dω = dω0 + Cα ,
α = ω −ω0 .
(8.4.28)

Let ∇C and ∇τ denote the Levi-Civita connections of the Riemannian metrics γ
on C and γ τ on M τ, respectively, and let RC and Rτ denote the corresponding
Riemann curvature tensors. According to [495, Lemma 1], for given vector ﬁelds
α, β on M τ and their horizontal lifts α, β to C τ, the covariant derivatives ∇C
α β and
∇τ
αβ are π-related.

Remark 8.4.10 From Proposition 8.4.9, or directly from (8.4.33), we read off the
sectional curvature K of a 2-plane P ⊂T[ω]M τ,
Kω(P) = 3⟨C∗
αβ, GωC∗
αβ⟩,
where α, β ∈Hτ
ω are the horizontal lifts of two orthonormal vectors spanning P.
We claim that the sectional curvature is non-negative, as in the case of the principal
stratum [47, 592]. To see this, denote ξ = C∗
αβ. Using that
im(Gω) = ker(Δω)⊥⊂im(Δω)
and that, according to (6.1.22), ΔωGω is the L2-orthogonal projector onto im(Δω),
we ﬁnd
⟨ξ, Gωξ⟩= ⟨ΔωGωξ, Gωξ⟩= ∥∇ωGωξ∥2 .
For an analysis of the scalar curvature we refer to [591].
♦
We conclude this section with a brief discussion of geodesics. In [75], a proof of the
following proposition was outlined.
Proposition 8.4.11 Let ω ∈C τ and α ∈Hτ
ω. Let I denote the connected component
of 0 in {t ∈R : ω + tα ∈C τ}. Then I is nonempty, open, and
I →M τ ,
t →πτ(ω + tα) ,

is a geodesic in M τ. Conversely, any geodesic in M τ is of this form.
Proof Clearly, the curve is contained in C τ and is a geodesic in C . Hence, it is a
geodesic in C τ. Since it is perpendicular to the G -orbit through ω, Corollary 26.12
in [447] yields that its projection to M τ is a geodesic in M τ.
Conversely, let γ be a geodesic in M τ and let γ be the horizontal lift of γ starting
at some representative ω of γ (0). By Lemma 26.11 in [447], γ is a geodesic in C τ.
Since the segment containing ω of the straight line t →ω+t ˙γ (0) in C τ is a geodesic
with the same initial conditions as γ , the latter coincides with that segment.
■
Remark 8.4.12 In the proof we have used that the straight line ω+tα is perpendicular
to the orbit through ω. Since C∗
αα = 0 (Exercise 8.4.3), we have
∇ω+tα ∗α = ∇ω∗α = 0 ,
(8.4.35)
that is, this straight line is perpendicular to any orbit it meets. This is consistent
with the general situation, where one can prove that if a geodesic in a Riemannian
submersion is perpendicular to one ﬁbre, then it is perpendicular to all ﬁbres it meets,
cf. Corollary 26.12 in [447].
Thus, Proposition 8.4.11 states that the geodesics in M τ are given by projections
of segments of straight lines inside C τ which are perpendicular to orbits. In particular,
the charts deﬁned by the slices S τ
ω0,ε provide normal coordinates.
♦
In [75], the above characterization of geodesics is used to prove that the principal
stratum need not be geodesically complete. In fact, the argument given there proves
the following.
Proposition 8.4.13 M τ is geodesically complete iff there is no τ ′ with τ ′ < τ.
Proof Indeed, for ω ∈C τ and α ∈Hτ
ω, we have Gω+tα ⊃Gω ∩Gα = Gω. Therefore,
ω + tα ∈C ≤τ ,
(8.4.36)
for all t ∈R. In particular, if there is no τ ′ with τ ′ < τ, the geodesic associated to ω
and α is deﬁned for all values t ∈R.
Now assume that τ ′ < τ for some τ ′. Choose x′ ∈M τ ′ and a tube Ux′,ε about
the orbit π−1(x′). Since Ux′,ε is a neighbourhood of π−1(x′) in C , the denseness
properties (8.3.11) imply Ux′,ε ∩C τ ̸= ∅. Hence, we ﬁnd ω′ ∈π−1(x′) and ω ∈C τ
such that ω ∈Sω′,ε. Let α ∈T such that ω′ = ω + α. Then, α ∈Hω′ and hence
∇ω′∗α = 0. Since C∗
αα = 0, this implies ∇ω∗α = 0 and hence α ∈Hω. Since ω
and ω′ are invariant under Gω, so is α. Thus, α ∈Hτ
ω. By Proposition 8.4.11, then a
segment of the straight line t →ω + tα projects to a geodesic in M τ. Clearly, this
geodesic cannot be prolonged to t = 1.
■
Proposition 8.4.13 implies, in particular, that the principal stratum is geodesically
complete iff there are no secondary strata.

The Gauge Orbit Space
Proposition 8.4.14 Let ω ∈C τ and α ∈Hτ
ω. The set of values t ∈R for which
ω + tα /∈C τ is discrete.
Proof Consider the continuous mapping η : R →C deﬁned by η(t) := ω + tα.
According to (8.4.36), the preimage η−1(C τ) of C τ is open in R, because C τ is open
in C ≤τ. Hence, R \ η−1(C τ) is closed in R.
Let t0 ∈R \ η−1(C τ). By Remark 8.4.12, α ∈ker(∇∗
η(t0)), so that the Tubular
Neighbourhood Theorem implies that η(t) = η(t0) + (t −t0)α ∈Sη(t0),ε for t close
to t0. If t0 were an accumulation point of R\η−1(C τ), there would exist t1 ̸= t0 such
that η(t1) ∈Sη(t0),ε ∩C τ ′ for some τ ′ < τ. By the slice properties, Gη(t1) ⊂Gη(t0).
Since η(t1) = η(t0) + (t1 −t0)α, then Gα ⊃Gη(t1). Writing ω = η(t1) −t1α one
sees that then Gη(t1) ⊂Gω (contradiction). Hence, R \ η−1(C τ) consists of isolated
points. Due to closedness, it is then discrete.

Classiﬁcation of Howe Subgroups
According to Theorem 8.2.8, to determine the gauge orbit types of a gauge theory
deﬁned on a principal G-bundle P(M, G), one has to classify the holonomy-induced
bundle reductions up to isomorphy and conjugacy under the principal action. Thus,
one has to work through the following programme.
1. Classify the Howe subgroups of G up to conjugacy.
2. Classify the Howe subbundles of P up to isomorphy.
3. Extract the Howe subbundles which are holonomy-induced.
4. Factorize by the principal action.
5. Determine the natural partial ordering.
In a series of papers, we have accomplished this programme for M having dimension
2, 3 or 4 and G being SU(n) [541, 543, 544] or another classical compact Lie group
[296, 297]. Here, we will discuss the case G = SU(n) in detail. In the present
section, we determine the Howe subgroups, thus accomplishing the ﬁrst step of the
programme.
Recall that, by Deﬁnition 8.2.4, a subgroup H of a Lie group G is called Howe
if there exists a subset A ⊂G such that H = CG(A). The basic properties of Howe
subgroups havebeenlistedinRemark 8.2.5. Inorder todeterminetheset of conjugacy

8.5 Classiﬁcation of Howe Subgroups

classes of Howe subgroups of SU(n), we consider SU(n) as a subset of Mn(C),
the associative algebra of complex (n × n)-matrices. By Remark 8.2.5, any Howe
subgroup H may be represented by its associated Howe dual pair (H, CG(H)). A
Howe dual pair is called reductive iff its members are reductive. In our case this
condition is automatically satisﬁed, because SU(n) is compact and Howe subgroups
are always closed.
Let K(n) denote the collection of pairs
J = (k, m) = ((k1, . . . , kr), (m1, . . . , mr)) ,
r = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n ,
of sequences of equal length consisting of positive integers which obey

We denote the image of this homomorphism by MJ(C) and deﬁne

SUJ := MJ(C) ∩SU(n) .
Clearly, UJ is the image of the subset r
i=1 U(ki) ⊂r
i=1 Mki(C) under (8.5.3).
Lemma 8.5.1 A subgroup of SU(n) is Howe iff it is conjugate to SUJ for some
J ∈K(n).
Proof One can check that the Howe subgroups of SU(n) are obtained from the Howe
subgroups of U(n) by intersection with SU(n) and that, for the latter, conjugacy under
U(n) boils down to conjugacy under SU(n) (Exercise 8.5.1). Hence, it sufﬁces to
prove that a subgroup of U(n) is Howe iff it is conjugate to UJ for some J ∈K(n).
First, let H be a Howe subgroup of U(n). Let H′ = CU(n)(H) and let K denote the
subgroup generated by H and H′. The vector space Cn decomposes into an orthogonal
direct sum of K-irreducible subspaces,
Cn = V1 ⊕· · · ⊕Vr .
(8.5.4)

666
8
The Gauge Orbit Space
Each Vi is invariant under H and thus decomposes orthogonally into H-irreducible
subspaces,
Vi = Wi,1 ⊕· · · ⊕Wi,mi .
Since Vi is K-irreducible, the subgroup H′ acts by intertwining all of these repre-
sentations with one another. Thus, by Schur's Lemma, all Wi,j are isomorphic to
Wi,1. Choosing an orthonormal basis in Wi,1 and denoting ki := dim(Wi), we obtain
Vi ∼= Cki ⊗Cmi. Since H and H′ are mutual centralizers, under this isomorphism,
H↾Vi = {ai ⊗1mi : ai ∈U(ki)} ,
H′
↾Vi = {1ki ⊗bi : bi ∈U(mi)} .
As a result, in an appropriate orthonormal basis in Cn, the elements of H can be
written in the form
a1 ⊗1m1 ⊕· · · ⊕ar ⊗1mr ,
ai ∈U(ki) .
Thus, H is conjugate under U(n) to the subgroup UJ with J = (k, m).
Conversely, let J ∈K(n). It sufﬁces to show that UJ is Howe. Consider the
centralizer M′ := CMn(C)(MJ(C)). Since MJ(C) is a unital ∗-subalgebra, so is M′.
In particular, M′ is spanned by the subset ˜M′ = M′ ∩U(n). Moreover, the Double
Commutant Theorem yields CMn(C)(M′) = MJ(C). Thus, we obtain
CU(n)( ˜M′) = CMn(C)( ˜M′) ∩U(n) = CMn(C)(M′) ∩U(n) = MJ(C) ∩U(n) = UJ .
This shows that UJ is Howe.
■
Lemma 8.5.2 For J, J′ ∈K(n), the Howe subgroups SUJ and SUJ′ of SU(n) are
conjugate iff there exists a permutation σ such that J′ = σJ.
Proof It sufﬁces to check that the subalgebras MJ(C) and MJ′(C) of Mn(C) are
conjugate under SU(n) iff J′ = σJ for some permutation σ. If σ exists, one can
construct a matrix T ∈SU(n) mapping the factors Ck′
i ⊗Cl′
i of the decomposition
(8.5.2) deﬁned by J′ identically onto the factors Ckσ(i) ⊗Cmσ(i) of the decomposition
deﬁned by J. Then, MJ′(C) = T −1MJ(C)T. Conversely, if MJ′(C) = T −1MJ(C)T
for some T ∈SU(n), then MJ(C) and MJ′(C) are isomorphic. Hence, k′ = σk for
some permutation σ. Since T is an isomorphism of the representations Mk1(C) ×
· · · × Mkr(C)
J
−→Mn(C) and
Mk1(C) × · · · × Mkr(C)
σ
−→Mk′
1(C) × · · · × Mk′r(C)
J′
−→Mn(C) ,
where J, J′ indicate the respective embeddings (8.5.3), it does not change the mul-
tiplicities of the irreducible factors. Thus, m′ = σm. It follows J′ = σJ.
■
As a consequence of Lemma 8.5.2, we can introduce an equivalence relation on the
set K(n) by putting J ∼J′ iff J′ = σJ for some permutation σ. Let ˆK(n) denote the
set of equivalence classes. Lemmas 8.5.1 and 8.5.2 yield the following.

8.5 Classiﬁcation of Howe Subgroups
667
Theorem 8.5.3 The assignment J →SUJ induces a bijection from ˆK(n) onto the
set of conjugacy classes of Howe subgroups of SU(n).
■
This concludes the classiﬁcation of Howe subgroups of SU(n).
In the remainder, we calculate the homotopy groups of SUJ. This will be needed
for the discussion of the Howe subbundles in the next section. For a given positive
integer l, deﬁne the homomorphisms
pl : U(1) →U(1) ,
pl(z) := zl ,
(8.5.5)
jl : Zl →U(1) ,
jl(k) := ei2πk/l .
(8.5.6)
Moreover, let
jJ : SUJ →UJ ,
iJ : UJ →U(n) ,
prUJ
i
: UJ →U(ki)
denote the natural inclusion mappings and the natural projections to the factors.
Finally, for a given element J = (k, m) of K(n), let g denote the greatest common
divisor of the members of m and deﬁne ˜m = ( ˜m1, . . . , ˜mr) by g ˜mi = mi for all i.
For D ∈UJ, we compute

i=1
p ˜mi ◦detU(ki) ◦prUJ
i (D) ,
(8.5.7)
then
detU(n) ◦iJ = pg ◦λJ .
(8.5.8)
As a consequence, the restriction of λJ to the subgroup SUJ takes values in ker pg =
jg(Zg). Hence, we obtain an induced homomorphism
λS
J : SUJ →Zg
satisfying
λJ ◦jJ = jg ◦λS

Lemma 8.5.4 The homomorphism λS

Proof Since Zg is discrete, λS
J must be constant on connected components. Hence
SUJ0 ⊂ker λS
J and λS
J projects to a homomorphism SUJ/SUJ0 →Zg. The latter
is surjective, because so is λS

By assumption, (detU(k1) D1, . . . , detU(kr) Dr) ∈ker ϕ. Since the exponents deﬁning
ϕ have greatest common divisor 1, ker ϕ is connected. Thus, there exists a path t →
(γ1(t), . . . , γr(t)) in ker ϕ running from (detU(k1) D1, . . . , detU(kr) Dr) to (1, . . . , 1).
For each i = 1, . . . , r, deﬁne a path t →Gi(t) in U(ki) as follows: ﬁrst, go from Di
to (detU(ki)Di) ⊕1ki−1, keeping the determinant constant, thus using connectedness
of SU(ki). Then, use the path t →γi(t) ⊕1ki−1 to get to 1ki. By construction, the
image of (G1(t), . . . , Gr(t)) under the embedding (8.5.3) is a path in SUJ connecting
D with 1n. This proves ker λS
J ⊂SUJ0.

8.6
Classiﬁcation of Howe Subbundles
In this section, we are going to derive the Howe subbundles of principal SU(n)-
bundles up to vertical isomorphisms. By the results of the previous section, we can
restrict attention to the structure groups SUJ, J ∈K(n). Thus, let J ∈K(n) be ﬁxed.
We shall ﬁrst derive a description of principal SUJ-bundles in terms of suitable
characteristic classes and then characterize those which are redutions of a given
principal SUJ-bundle P. We start from the general classiﬁcation result of Chap.3
stating that there exists a bijective correspondence between the set of vertical isomor-
phism classes of SUJ-bundles over M and the set [M, BSUJ] of homotopy classes of
continuous mappings from M to the classifying space BSUJ, given by assigning to
f : M →BSUJ the pullback under f of the universal SUJ-bundle ESUJ. Recall that
BSUJ can be realized as a CW-complex, cf. Remark 3.4.19. In general, [M, BSUJ]
is hard to handle and it cannot be expected to be classiﬁed by characteristic classes.
However, Theorem 4.8.7 allows us to successively construct the Postnikov tower of
BSUJ up to the ﬁfth stage, thus obtaining a 5-equivalent approximation (BSUJ)5.
Thus, if we assume that dim(M) ≤4, then [M, BSUJ] = [M, (BSUJ)5] and the
explicit form of (BSUJ)5 allows for ﬁnding the kind of characteristic classes which
are necessary to classify principal SUJ-bundles. Finally, we shall construct these
classes explicitly. The procedure described is common if one deals with bundle clas-
siﬁcation problems, see for example [43] or [677].
Now, let us construct (BSUJ)5. We use the results and the notation of Sect.4.8.
Recall, in particular, that for a given Abelian group A and a given integer l ≥0,
the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(A, l) is deﬁned up to homotopy equivalence by
having the homotopy group A in dimension l and trivial homotopy groups in all
other dimensions, cf. Appendix G. Let r∗denote the number of indices i for which
ki > 1.

The Gauge Orbit Space
Proof In the proof, we denote B ≡BSUJ. First, we check that B is simple, that
is, that the natural action of π1(B) on πi(B) is trivial for all i ≥1. According to
Proposition3.2.9,itsufﬁcestocheckthatthenaturalactionofπ0(SUJ)onπi−1(SUJ),
induced by inner automorphisms, is trivial. This follows by observing that any inner
automorphism of SUJ is generated by an element of (SUJ)0 and hence is homotopic
to the identity automorphism. Thus, having realized B as a CW-complex, we can
apply Theorem 4.8.7 to construct the Postnikov tower. According to Theorem 8.5.5,
the relevant homotopy groups are
π1(B) = Zg ,
π2(B) = Z⊕(r−1) ,
π3(B) = 0 ,
π4(B) = Z⊕r∗.

Stage 1. B1 is contractible and may therefore be replaced by B1 = ∗.
Stage 2. B2 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the total space of the pullback of
the path-loop ﬁbration over K(π1(B), 2) under a mapping θ1 : B1 →K(π1(B), 2).
Since B1 = ∗, the total space coincides with the ﬁbre K(π1(B), 1). Thus, B2 is
weakly homotopy equivalent to K(Zg, 1). Realizing the latter as a CW-complex, we
can conclude that B2 is in fact homotopy equivalent to K(Zg, 1) and, therefore, can
be replaced by the latter:
B2 = K(Zg, 1) .
(8.6.4)
Stage 3. B3 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the total space of the path-loop
ﬁbration over K(π2(B), 3) by some mapping θ2 : B2 →K(π2(B), 3). In view of
(8.6.4) and (8.6.2), θ2 is a mapping K(Zg, 1) →K(Z⊕(r−1), 3). Using
K(A1 ⊕A2, l) = K(A1, l) × K(A2, l)

Z(B3) as a sum over tensor

Z (K(Z, 2)) ⊗· · · ⊗Hjr−1

where j + j1 + · · · + jr−1 = 5. Due to this constraint, each summand contains a
tensor factor of odd degree and hence is trivial by (8.6.3). Thus, θ4 is homotopic to
a constant mapping. It follows that B5 may be replaced by the direct product of B3
with the ﬁbre K(Z⊕r∗, 4) = r∗

Z(K(Z, 2)) and

in [104]. Hence, Theorem 8.6.1 and equation (G.1) imply that the mapping

of BSUJ deﬁne a set of characteristic classes which classiﬁes SUJ-bundles over
manifolds of dimension ≤4. These classes are independent and surjective. However,
they are hard to handle, because we do not know the homomorphism y∗
5 explicitly.
Therefore, we prefer to work with characteristic classes deﬁned by some natural
generators of the cohomology groups in question. The price we have to pay is that
the corresponding classes are subject to a relation and that we have to determine
their image explicitly. Thus, our next aim is to construct generators of H2
Z(BSUJ),
H4
Z(BSUJ) and H1
Zg(BSUJ).
First, let us discuss the integral cohomology groups. Generators for H∗
Z(BSUJ)
can be obtained as follows. Consider the classifying mappings

Lemma 8.6.4 The homomorphism (BjJ)∗: H∗
Z(BUJ) →H∗
Z(BSUJ) is surjective.

8.6 Classiﬁcation of Howe Subbundles
673
Proof According to Proposition 3.7.8/2, the mapping BjJ : BSUJ →BUJ is the
projection in a principal bundle with structure group UJ/SUJ ∼= U(1). Denote this
bundle by Q. Being orientable, Q has a Gysin sequence, cf. Theorem 4.1.10,
· · · →Hl

Z (BUJ)

−−−−→Hl+1
Z (BUJ) →· · ·
If Q were trivial, we would have π1(BSUJ) ∼= π1(BUJ × U(1)) ∼= Z, which would
contradict Theorem 8.5.5. Hence, Q is nontrivial. According to Theorem 4.8.1, then
c1(Q) ̸= 0. Due to Lemma 8.6.3, H∗
Z(BUJ) does not have zero divisors. It follows
that multiplication by c1(Q) is an injective operation on H∗
Z(BUJ). Then, exactness
of the Gysin sequence implies that the connecting homomorphism ϕ is trivial and,
therefore, (BjJ)∗is surjective.
■
Lemmas 8.6.3 and 8.6.4 yield the following.
Corollary 8.6.5 (Integral cohomology of BSUJ) The ring H∗
Z(BSUJ) is generated
by c
SUJ,i
j
, j = 1, . . . , ki, i = 1, . . . , r.
■
The generators c
SUJ,i
j
are subject to a relation. Since this relation turns out to be a
consequence of a more fundamental relation which will be derived below, it does not
play a role in the sequel.
Next, we construct generators for H1
Zg(BSUJ). For that purpose, we use the homo-
morphism λS
J : SUJ →Zg deﬁned by (8.5.9).
Lemma 8.6.6 The mapping

BλS
J
∗: H1
Zg(BZg) →H1
Zg(BSUJ) is an isomorphism.
Proof By Lemma 8.5.4, the induced homomorphism λS
J ∗: π0(SUJ) →π0(Zg) is
an isomorphism. Hence, so is

BλS
J

∗: π1(BSUJ) →π1(BZg) . Now, the assertion
follows by the Hurewicz Theorem and the Universal Coefﬁcient Theorem.
■
We conclude that generators of H1
Zg(BSUJ) can be obtained as the images of gener-
ators of H1
Zg(BZg) under

BλS
J
∗. Since according to the discussion prior to Theorem
4.8.3, BZg is an Eilenberg-MacLane space of type K(Zg, 1), we have
H1
Z(BZg) ∼= Hom(Zg, Zg) ∼= Zg .
To choose a generator, we use the homomorphism jg : Zg →U(1) deﬁned by (8.5.6)
and the short exact sequence of coefﬁcient groups
0 −→Z
μg
−→Z
ρg
−→Zg −→0 ,
(8.6.9)
where μg denotes multiplication by g and ρg reduction modulo g. Recall that
this sequence induces a long exact sequence of coefﬁcient homomorphisms [104,

Lemma 8.6.7 There exists a unique element δg ∈H1
Zg(BZg) such that
βg(δg) =

Bjg
∗c
U(1)

,
(8.6.11)
and this element is a generator of H1
Zg(BZg).
Proof Clearly, both βg(δg) and

Bjg
∗c
U(1)
1
are elements of H2
Zg(BZg) so that equation
(8.6.11) makes sense.
Since BZg is an Eilenberg-MacLane space of type K(Zg, 1), we can read off
H∗
Z(BZg) from (G.4) to obtain the following portion of the exact sequence (8.6.10):
H1

μg

We conclude that ker(βg) = 0 and that μg is trivial. Thus, βg is an isomorphism.
This proves existence and uniqueness of δg.
To check that δg is a generator, consider the pair J◦=

(1), (g)

∈K(g). Observe
that Zg ∼= SUJ◦, U(1) ∼= UJ◦, and that jg corresponds to jJ◦: SUJ◦→UJ◦.
Then, Lemma 8.6.4 implies that

Bjg
∗is surjective. Thus, H2
Z(BZg) is generated by

Bjg
∗c
U(1)
1
and, therefore, H1
Zg(BZg) is generated by δg.
■
We deﬁne
δJ :=

As a consequence of Lemmas 8.6.6 and 8.6.7, we obtain the following.
Corollary 8.6.8 The cohomology group H1
Zg(BSUJ) is generated by δJ.

8.6 Classiﬁcation of Howe Subbundles

The characteristic classes ci and δJ allow for classifying principal SUJ-bundles.
To state the result, let HJ
Z(M) denote the subset of r
i=1 H∗
Z(M) consisting of the
sequences α = (α1, . . . , αr) whose members are of the form αi = 1+αi,1+· · ·+αi,ki
with αi,j ∈H2j

.
Theorem 8.6.12 (Classiﬁcation of principal SUJ-bundles) Let M be a manifold of
dimension ≤4 and let J ∈K(n). Then, the characteristic classes ci and δJ deﬁne a
bijection from the set of vertical isomorphism classes of principal SUJ-bundles over
M onto K(M, J).
Proof By Corollary 8.6.2, it remains to prove that for every (α, ξ) ∈K(M, J), there
exists a principal SUJ-bundle Q over M such that c(Q) = α and δJ(Q) = ξ. Since
dim M ≤4, by Theorem 4.8.8, there exist principal U(ki)-bundles over M such that
c(Qi) = αi, i = 1, . . . , r. Consider the ﬁbre product ˜Q = Q1 ×M · · · ×M Qr , which
has structure group r
i=1 U(ki) and may thus be interpreted as a UJ-bundle. Then,
˜Q[ prUJ
i
] ∼= Qi ,
i = 1, . . . , r .
(8.6.25)
The desired SUJ-bundle Q will arise as a reduction of ˜Q. To ﬁnd it, consider the
associated principal U(1)-bundle ˜Q[λJ].
We claim that ˜Q[λJ] admits a reduction to the subgroup Zg ⊂U(1). By Theorem
4.8.3, there exists a principal Zg-bundle R over M such that δg(R) = ξ. Consider the
principal U(1)-bundle R[jg] obtained by extension with the homomorphism jg deﬁned
by (8.5.6). On the one hand, using Corollary 4.1.4, Lemma 8.6.7 and naturality of the
Bockstein homomorphism βg, we ﬁnd c1

R[jg]
= βg(ξ) . On the other hand, a similar
calculation using (8.6.18) yields c1
 ˜Q[λJ]
= E ˜m,1(α) . Since (α, ξ) ∈K(M, J), these
classes coincide. As a consequence, Theorem 4.8.1 implies that ˜Q[λJ] and R[jg] are
vertically isomorphic. Hence, R is a reduction of ˜Q[λJ].
Now, we can deﬁne Q to be the preimage of the reduction R of ˜Q[λJ] under the
natural bundle morphism ˜Q →˜Q[λJ]. By construction, Q is a reduction of ˜Q to the
subgroup λ−1
J (Zg) = SUJ ⊂UJ.
It remains to compute ci(Q) and δJ(Q). Since Q[jJ] = ˜Q, using (8.6.23) and
(8.6.25), we ﬁnd
ci(Q) = c

Q[prUJ

Theorem 8.6.14 (Classiﬁcation of Howe subbundles) Let P be a principal SU(n)-
bundle over a manifold M of dimension ≤4 and let J ∈K(n). Then, the characteristic
classes ci and δJ deﬁne a bijection from the set of vertical isomorphism classes of
reductions of P to the subgroup SUJ onto K(P, J).
Proof Let Q ⊂P be a principal SUJ-bundle over M. By Theorem 8.6.12, the pair

c(Q), δJ(Q)

belongs to K(M, J). Lemma 8.6.13 implies that it belongs to the
subset K(P, J) iff c

Q[iS

= c(P). Since dim M ≤4, by Theorem 4.8.8, the latter is
equivalent to Q[iS
J ] ∼= P, that is, to the condition that Q be a reduction of P.
■
Remark 8.6.15 The equation Em(α) = c(P) actually contains the two equations
Em,1(α) = 0 and Em,2(α) = c2(P). However, under the assumption that (α, ξ)
belongs to K(M, J), the ﬁrst one is redundant, because in this case, due to (8.6.16),
one has Em,1(α) = g E ˜m,1(α) = g βg(ξ) = 0. Thus, the relevant equations are
E ˜m,1(α) = βg(ξ) ,
(8.6.27)
Em,2(α) = c2(P) ,
(8.6.28)
where α ∈HJ
Z(M) and ξ ∈H1
Zg(M). The set of solutions of equation (8.6.27) yields
K(M, J) and hence the principal SUJ-bundles over M. The set of solutions of both
Eqs.(8.6.27) and (8.6.28) yields K(P, J) and, therefore, the reductions of P to the
subgroup SUJ.
♦
This concludes the classiﬁcation of Howe subbundles of P, that is, Step 2 of our
programme.
Example 8.6.16 Let us discuss some examples of J ∈K(n), including the two trivial
ones, corresponding to the center and the whole group. For brevity, we shall write J
in the form J = (k1, . . . , kr|m1, . . . , mr).

8.6 Classiﬁcation of Howe Subbundles
679
1. J = (1|n). We have SUJ = Zn, the center of SU(n), and hence g = n. Variables
are ξ ∈H1
Zn(M) and α = 1 + α1, with α1 ∈H2
Z(M). According to (8.6.14) and
(8.6.15), Eqs.(8.6.27) and (8.6.28) read
α1 = βn(ξ) ,
n(n −1)
2
α2
1 = c2(P) .
Since the ﬁrst equation yields nα1 = 0, the second one requires c2(P) = 0. It
follows that K(P, J) is nonempty iff P is trivial. In that case, the ﬁrst equation
implies that K(P, J) is parameterized by ξ. This coincides with what is known
about Zn-reductions of SU(n)-bundles.
2. J = (n|1). We have SUJ = SU(n) and hence g = 1. Accordingly, the variable
is α = 1 + α1 + α2. Equations (8.6.27) and (8.6.28) read
α1 = 0 ,
α2 = c2(P) .
Thus, as expected, K(P, J) consists of P itself.
3. J = (1, 1|2, 2) ∈K(4). One can check that SUJ has the connected components
{diag(z, z, z−1, z−1) : z ∈U(1)} ,
{diag(z, z, −z−1, −z−1) : z ∈U(1)} .
It is therefore isomorphic to U(1) × Z2. Variables are ξ ∈H1
Z2(M) and αi =
1 + αi,1, i = 1, 2. Equations (8.6.27) and (8.6.28) read
α1,1 + α2,1 = β2(ξ) ,
α2
1,1 + α2
2,1 + 4α1,1 ∪α2,1 = c2(P) .
Since products including β2(ξ) vanish, by eliminating α2,1 we obtain
−2α2
1,1 = c2(P) .
(8.6.29)
4. J = (2, 3|1, 1) ∈K(5). We have SUJ = S(U(2) × U(3)) which is isomorphic
to the symmetry group U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) of the standard model. In the grand
uniﬁed SU(5)-model this is the subgroup to which SU(5) is broken by the heavy
Higgs ﬁeld. Variables are αi = 1 + αi,1 + αi,2. Equations (8.6.27) and (8.6.28)
read
α1,1 + α2,1 = 0 ,
α1,2 + α2,2 + α1,1 ∪α2,1 = c2(P) .
Eliminating α2,1 = −α1,1 and α2,2 = c2(P)−α1,2 +α2
1,1, we see that K(P, J) can
be parameterized by α1 (or α2), that is, by the Chern class of one of the factors
U(2) or U(3). Due to the important role S(U(2) × U(3)) is playing in elementary
particle physics, this has been known for a long time [338].
♦
Remark 8.6.17 As an illustration, let us discuss Eq.(8.6.29) explicitly for the base
manifolds M = S4, S2 × S2 and L3
p × S1, where L3
p denotes the 3-dimensional lens
space of order p. Since M is compact and orientable, we have H4
Z(M) = Z.

The Gauge Orbit Space
1. M = S4. Since H2
Z(M) = 0, K(P, J) is nonempty iff c2(P) = 0. In that case, it
consists of the trivial U(1) × Z2-bundle only.
2. For M = S2 × S2, we choose a generator (orientation) γ S
2 of H2
Z(M) to expand
α1,1 = a γ S
2 ×1 + b 1×γ S
2 ,
c2(P) = cγ S
2 × γ S
2
with a, b, c ∈Z. Then, Eq.(8.6.29) becomes
−4ab = c .
(8.6.30)
If c = 0, there are two obvious series of solutions. In particular, K(P, J) is
inﬁnite here. If c = 4l for some l ̸= 0, then a runs through the positive and
negative divisors of l and b = −l/a. If c is not divisible by 4, then K(P, J) is
empty.
3. M = L3
p × S1. The relevant cohomology groups of Lp
3 are
H1
Z(L3
p) = 0 ,
H2
Z(L3
p) = Zp ,
H1
Zg(L3
p) = Hom(Zp, Zg) = Z⟨p,g⟩,
where ⟨p, g⟩denotes the greatest common divisor of p and g. Hence, by the
Künneth Theorem for cohomology,
H1
Zg(M) = Z⟨p,g⟩⊕Zg ,
H2
Z(M) = Zp .
Since H2
Z(M) is torsion, K(P, J) is nonempty iff c2(P) = 0. In that case, it is
parameterized independently by ξ ∈Z⟨2,p⟩⊕Z2 and α1,1 ∈Zp.
The case of base manifold S2 × S2 illustrates that equation (8.6.28) generally leads
to a Diophantine equation. Here, this equation is bilinear. For bilinear Diophantine
equations, there exists an algorithm to parameterize the set of solutions [596]. The
situation is different, for example, for the base manifold M = CP2. Here the equation
obtained from (8.6.28) is quadratic and, therefore, substantially harder to discuss. ♦

Enumeration of Gauge Orbit Types
In this section, we complete the enumeration of gauge orbit types. First, we accom-
plish step 3 of our programme, that is, we determine which Howe subbundles of a
given principal SU(n)-bundle P are holonomy-induced.
Lemma 8.7.1 Let H and H′ be Howe subgroups of SU(n) such that H ⊂H′. If
dim H = dim H′, then H = H′.
Proof There exist J, J′ ∈K(n) such that H and H′ are conjugate to SUJ and SUJ′,
respectively. Consider UJ and UJ′. Since H ⊂H′, we can ﬁnd D ∈SU(n) such that
D−1UJD ⊂UJ′. By assumption,
dim(UJ′) = dim(H) + 1 = dim(H′) + 1 = dim(UJ) .
Since UJ′ is connected and D−1UJD is closed in UJ′, equality of dimension implies
D−1UJD = UJ′. Then, D−1SUJD = SUJ′ and hence H = H′.
■
Theorem 8.7.2 Any Howe subbundle of a principal SU(n)-bundle is holonomy-
induced.
Proof Let P be a principal SU(n)-bundle and let Q be a Howe subbundle of P with
structure group H. Choose a connected component ˜Q of Q and let ˜H denote the
corresponding structure group. Since H is Howe, C2
SU(n)( ˜H) ⊂C2
SU(n)(H) = H.
Since dim ˜H = dim H, the subgroups C2
SU(n)( ˜H) and H have the same dimension.
Then, Lemma 8.7.1 implies C2
SU(n)( ˜H) = H and, hence, the assertion.
■
One may wonder whether there exist Howe subbundles which are not holonomy-
induced. Let us give an example. Consider the subgroup H = {13, diag(−1, −1, 1)}
of SO(3). One can check that H is Howe. Thus, the reduction Q = M × H of the
trivial bundle M ×SO(3) is a Howe subbundle. Any connected reduction ˜Q of Q has
the center Z = {13} as its structure group. Since the center is Howe itself, we ﬁnd
˜Q · C2
G(Z) = ˜Q ̸= Q . Thus, Q is not holonomy-induced.
Now, we turn to step 4 of our programme, that is, we determine which of the
isomorphism classes of Howe subbundles get identiﬁed under the principal SU(n)-
action on P. Since this action conjugates the structure groups, it sufﬁces to restrict
attention to the reductions to the subgroups SUJ with J ∈K(n). Deﬁne
K(P) =
#
J∈K(n)
K(P, J) .
(8.7.1)
We shall denote the elements of K(P) by L and write them in the form L = (J; α, ξ),
where J ∈K(n) and (α, ξ) ∈K(P, J). By a Howe subbundle of P of type
L = (J; α, ξ) we mean a bundle reduction Q of P to the subgroup SUJ with the
characteristic classes c(QL) = α and δJ(QL) = ξ. On the set K(P), we introduce the

682
8
The Gauge Orbit Space
following equivalence relation: (J; α, ξ) ∼(J′; α′, ξ ′) iff there exists a permutation
σ such that J′ = σJ and α′ = σα. Clearly, in that case, the sequences constituting
J and J′ must have the same length r. Let us furthermore introduce the following
notation. For every combination of elements J, J′ ∈K(n), we put
N(J, J′) := {D ∈SU(n) : D−1SUJD ⊂SUJ′} .
This is a subset of SU(n). Every element D ∈N(J, J′) deﬁnes an algebra embedding
hM
D : M(J) →M(J′) ,
C →D−1CD ,
and, by restriction, Lie subgroup embeddings hU
D : UJ →UJ′ and hS
D : SUJ →
SUJ′.
Lemma 8.7.3 Let L, L′ ∈K(P) and let Q and Q′ be Howe subbundles of P of type L
and L′, respectively. Then, Q′ is vertically isomorphic to ΨD(Q) for some D ∈SU(n)
iff L′ ∼L.
Proof Let L = (J; α, ξ) and L′ = (J′; α′, ξ ′). One can check that
ΨD(Q) ∼= Q[hS
D] .
Accordingly, by Proposition 3.7.2/1, if Q has classifying mapping f , then ΨD(Q) has
classifying mapping BhS
D ◦f . Due to λS
J′ ◦hS
D = λS
J, this implies, in particular,
δJ′
ΨD(Q)

= δJ(Q) .
(8.7.2)
First, assume that Q′ is vertically isomorphic to ΨD(Q) for some D ∈SU(n).
Then,
c

ΨD(Q)

= α′ ,
δJ′
ΨD(Q)

= ξ ′ .
(8.7.3)
In view of (8.7.2), the second equation implies ξ ′ = ξ. Moreover, D ∈N(J, J′)
and hU
D and hS
D are isomorphisms. Consequently, there exists a permutation σ such
that hU
D maps the σ(i)-th factor of UJ isomorphically onto the i-th factor of UJ′.
Then, in particular, J′ = σJ. It remains to show that α′ = σα. For that purpose, we
bring D to a normal form as follows. Given σ, we can ﬁnd Dσ ∈N(J, J′) such that
prUJ′
i
◦hU
Dσ = prUJ
σ(i) for all i. Then,
prUJ′
i
◦jJ′ ◦hS
Dσ = prUJ
σ(i) ◦jJ .
(8.7.4)
Moreover, C = DD−1
σ
∈N(J, J) and hU
C is an automorphism of UJ which leaves
each factor invariant separately. One can check that hU
C, and hence hS
C, is inner. Since
any inner automorphism of SUJ can be generated by an element of the connected
component of the identity, we conclude BhS
C = idBSUJ and thus BhS
D = BhS
Dσ . As a
consequence, BhS
Dσ ◦f is a classifying mapping for ΨD(Q). Using this and Corollary

4.1.4, from (8.7.4) we derive
c

.
(8.7.5)
In view of (8.7.3), this implies α′ = σα and hence, ﬁnally, L′ ∼L.
Conversely, assume that ξ ′ = ξ and α′ = σα, J′ = σJ for some permutation
σ. Then, in particular, there exists D = Dσ ∈N(J, J′) satisfying (8.7.4) and hence
(8.7.5). It follows that c

ΨD(Q)

= σα = α′ = c(Q′) . Similarly, (8.7.2) yields
δJ′
ΨD(Q)

= δJ′(Q′). As a consequence, Theorem 8.6.12 implies that ΨD(Q) and
Q′ are vertically isomorphic.
■
Let ˆK(P) denote the set of equivalence classes in K(P). Combining Lemma 8.7.3 with
Theorem 8.6.14, we ﬁnally arrive at the following result. Recall that Red∗(P) denotes
the set of holonomy-induced bundle reductions of P modulo vertical isomorphisms
and conjugacy under the principal action on P.
Theorem 8.7.4 (Classiﬁcation of holonomy-induced bundle reductions) Let P be
a principal SU(n)-bundle over a manifold M of dimension ≤4. The assignment to
L ∈K(P) of a bundle reduction Q of P of type L induces a bijection from ˆK(P) onto
Red∗(P).
■
With Theorem 8.7.4 we have accomplished the enumeration of gauge orbit types. As
a result, these orbit types are in bijective correspondence with the elements of ˆK(P).
Let us summarize.
Corollary 8.7.5 (Enumeration of gauge orbit types) For G = SU(n) and dim M =
2, 3, 4, gauge orbit types are in one-to-one correspondence with symbols [(J; α, ξ)],
where
1. J = ((k1, . . . , kr), (m1, . . . , mr)) is a pair of sequences of positive integers
obeying
r

i=1
kimi = n ,
2. α = (α1, . . . , αr) is a sequence of elements αi ∈H∗
Z(M) representing admissible
values of the Chern classes of U(ki)-bundles over M,
3. ξ ∈H1
Zg(M), where g is the greatest common divisor of (m1, . . . , mr).
The cohomology elements αi and ξ are subject to the relations

where βg : H1

Z(M) is the Bockstein homomorphism associated with the
short exact sequence of coefﬁcient groups 0 →Z →Z →Zg →0 . For any
permutation σ of {1, . . . , r}, the symbols [(J; α, ξ)] and [(σJ; σα, ξ)] have to be
identiﬁed.

The Gauge Orbit Space
8.8
Partial Ordering
In this section we are going to characterize the natural partial ordering of gauge orbit
types in terms of the classifying set ˆK(P). For the technical details, we refer to [544].
According to Theorem 8.2.8, the partial ordering of gauge orbit types corresponds
to the partial ordering on ˆK(P) which is induced from the inclusion relation between
bundle reductions. Thus, we put [L] ≤[L′] if there exist bundle reductions Q of type
L and Q′ of type L′ such that ΨD(Q) ⊂Q′ for some D ∈SU(n). Let L = (J; α, ξ)
with J = (k, m) = ((k1, . . . , kr), (m1, . . . , mr)) and L′ = (J′; α′, ξ ′) with J′ =
(k′, m′) = ((k′
1, . . . , k′
r), (m′
1, . . . , m′
r)) be given.
First, we observe that ΨD(Q) ⊂Q′ implies D ∈N(J, J′). Since MJ(C) and
MJ′(C) are ﬁnite-dimensional unital C∗-algebras, the embedding hM
D deﬁned by C →
D−1CD is characterized by a so-called inclusion matrix Δ. This is an (r′ ×r)-matrix
whose entries Δi′i are given by the numbers of basic representations contained in the
representations
Mki(C) −→MJ(C)
hM
D
−→MJ′(C) →Mk′
i′ (C) ,
where the ﬁrst arrow is the canonical embedding to the ith factor of MJ(C) and the
third arrow is the natural projection to the i′th factor of MJ′(C). Since the embedding
hM
D is unital, $
i Δi′iki = k′
i′ for all i′. Since conjugation of MJ(C) by D−1 preserves
the total number of basic representations of the factor Mki(C) in Mn(C), we have
$
i′ Δi′im′
i′ = mi for all i. Thus, Δ solves the system of equations
Δ k = k′ ,
m = ΔTm′ .
(8.8.1)
Conversely, assume that a solution Δ of (8.8.1) is given. Then, the decompositions
(8.5.2) associated with J and J′ admit subdecompositions
Cn =
r

i=1
Cki ⊗

respectively, which differ by a permutation of the factors Cki ⊗CΔi′i ⊗Cm′
i′ . From
this permutation, a matrix D ∈N(J, J′) with inclusion matrix Δ can be constructed.
It follows that SUJ ⊂SUJ′ up to conjugacy iff the system of equations (8.8.1) has
a solution Δ.
Second, we observe that the extension of ΨD(Q) to the structure group SUJ′ is
vertically isomorphic to Q[hS
D]. Hence, ΨD(Q) ⊂Q′ iff
c

Q[hS

which is a generalization of (8.6.13), we obtain

Here, reduction mod g′ is well deﬁned on Zg-valued cohomology, because the second
equation in (8.8.1) implies that g′ divides g. Using that the characteristic class of the
mod g′-reduction of a Zg-bundle is given by the mod g′-reduction of the characteristic
class of this bundle (Exercise 8.8.3), we obtain
δJ

Q[hS

δJ(Q)

(8.8.4)
From (8.8.2), (8.8.3) and (8.8.4) we conclude that ΨD(Q) ⊂Q′ iff
EΔ(α) = α′ ,
(8.8.5)
ρg′(ξ) = ξ ′ .
(8.8.6)
Let us introduce the following notation. If (8.8.6) holds, let N(L, L′) be the set of
solutions of the system of equations (8.8.1) and (8.8.5). If (8.8.6) does not hold, let
N(L, L′) = ∅. To summarize, we have shown the following.
Theorem 8.8.1 Let L, L′ ∈K(P). Then [L] ≤[L′] if and only if N(L, L′) ̸= ∅.
■
Example 8.8.2 Consider the trivial bundle P = M ×SU(4). Let L = (J; α, ξ), L′ =
(J′; α′, ξ ′) ∈K(P) with J = (1, 1|2, 2) and J′ = (2, 2|1, 1). Then, SUJ ∼= U(1) ×
Z2. The subgroup SUJ′ can be parameterized by
SUJ′ =

: z ∈U(1), A, B ∈SU(2)

.
It is therefore isomorphic to

U(1) × SU(2) × SU(2)

/Z2. To determine N(L, L′),
we ﬁrst consider the system of equations (8.8.1):

EΔc(α) = (α2

Condition (8.8.6) is trivially satisﬁed due to g′ = 1. Thus, N(L, L′) ̸= ∅precisely
in one of the following cases:

Remark 8.8.3 Any inclusion matrix Δ can be visualized by a diagram consisting of
a series of upper vertices, labelled by i = 1, . . . , r, and a series of lower vertices,
labelled by i′ = 1, . . . , r′. For each combination of i and i′, the corresponding vertices
are connected by Δi′i edges. For example, the matrices Δa, Δb and Δc in the above
example give rise to the diagrams
Δa:

The diagrams assigned in this way to the elements of N(J, J′) are special cases of
so-called Bratteli diagrams [101]. The latter have, in general, several stages pictur-
ing the subsequent inclusion matrices associated to an ascending sequence of ﬁnite
dimensional von-Neumann algebras A1 ⊂A2 ⊂A3 ⊂· · · . For this reason, we refer
to the diagram associated to Δ ∈N(J, J′) as the Bratteli diagram of Δ. We remark
that, due to the ﬁrst equation in (8.8.1), Δ cannot have a zero row. By the second
equation, it cannot have a zero column either. Accordingly, each vertex of the Bratteli
diagram of Δ is met by at least one edge.
♦
In what follows, we give a brief survey about the characterization and generation
of direct successors and direct predecessors. Proofs can be found in [544].
Theorem 8.8.4 (Characterization of direct successors and predecessors) Let L =
(J; α, ξ), L′ = (J′; α′, ξ ′) ∈K(P). Then, [L′] is a direct successor of [L] if and only
if N(L, L′) contains an element with Bratteli diagram

To generate direct successors and predecessors, let L = (J; α, ξ) ∈K(P) with
J = (k, m). Consider the following operations applied to L. We leave it to the reader
to check that all the tuples L′ = (J′; α′, ξ ′) produced by these operations belong to
K(P) (Exercise 8.8.2).
1. Splitting. Choose i0 such that mi0 ̸= 1 and decompose mi0 = mi0,1 + mi0,2 with
strictly positive integers mi0,1, mi0,2. Deﬁne k′ and α′ by doubling the entries ki0
and αi0, respectively, and m′ by replacing the single entry mi0 by the two entries
mi0,1, mi0,2. Then, by construction, the greatest common divisor g′ of m′ divides
g and we can put ξ ′ = ρg′(ξ).
2. Merging. Choose i1 < i2 such that mi1 = mi2. Deﬁne k′, m′ and α′ by deleting
the i2-th entry and replacing the entry ki1 of k by ki1 + ki2 and the entry αi1 of α
by αi1 ∪αi2. Then, g′ = g and we can put ξ ′ = ξ.
3. Inverse splitting. Choose i1 < i2 such that ki1 = ki2 and αi1 = αi2. Deﬁne
k′, m′ and α′ by deleting the i2-th entry and replacing the entry mi1 of m by
mi1 + mi2. Then, g divides g′. Choose ξ ′ ∈H1
Zg′(M) such that ξ = ρg(ξ ′) and
βg′(ξ ′) = E ˜m′,1(α′).
4. Inverse Merging. Choose i0 such that ki0 ̸= 1 and decompose ki0 = ki0,1 + ki0,2
withstrictlypositiveintegerski0,1,ki0,2.Forl = 1, 2,choosecohomologyelements
αi0,l = 1+αi0,l,1 +· · ·+αi0,l,ki0,l with αi0,l,j ∈H2j
Z (M) such that αi0,1 ∪αi0,2 = αi0.
Deﬁne k′ and α′ by replacing the corresponding i0-th entry by the two entries
ki,1, ki,2 and αi,1, αi,2, respectively, and deﬁne m′ by doubling the i0-the entry.
Then, g′ = g and we can put ξ ′ = ξ.
Theorem 8.8.5 (Generation of direct successors and predecessors) Let [L] ∈ˆK(P)
and let L be a representative. The direct successors (predecessors) of [L] are obtained
by applying all possible splittings and mergings (inverse splittings and inverse merg-
ings) to L and passing to equivalence classes.

The Gauge Orbit Space
Remark 8.8.6
1. It may happen that for certain elements of K(P) no splittings or no mergings can
be applied. Among such elements are, for example, those with mi = 1 for all i
(no splitting) and those having pairwise distinct mi (no merging). An analogous
statement is true for inverse splitting and inverse merging.
2. A direct inspection shows that for every L ∈K(P), the number of splitting or
merging operations which can be applied to L is ﬁnite. It follows that an element
of ˆK(P) can have at most ﬁnitely many direct successors and hence at most ﬁnitely
many successors.
♦
In the remainder of this section, we discuss two examples.
Example 8.8.7 Let P be a principal SU(4)-bundle and consider L = (J; α, ξ) with
J = (1, 1|2, 2). Here, αi = 1 + αi,1, i = 1, 2, and ξ ∈H1
Z2(M).
First, there are two splitting operations which can be applied to L. One is given
by i0 = 1 and the decomposition m1 = 2 = 1 + 1. It yields L′
a = (J′
a; α′
a, ξ ′
a), where
J′
a = (1, 1, 1|1, 1, 2), α′
a = (α1, α1, α2), and ξ ′
a = 0. The passage from L to L′
a can
be conveniently visualized by a Bratteli diagram whose vertices are labelled by the
respective quantities ki, mi and αi:

The equivalence classes of L′

b coincide iff α1 = α2. In order to see for which
bundles P this can happen, consider the Eqs.(8.6.27) and (8.6.28). The ﬁrst one
requires α1,1 = α2,1 to be a torsion element. Then, due to α1,2 = α2,2 = 0, the
second one implies c2(P) = 0. Thus, L′
a and L′
b can be equivalent only if P is trivial.
Next, there is a single merging operation, given by i1 = 1, i2 = 2. It yields L′

As a result, generically, [L] has three direct successors, represented by L′

Now, we turn to the generation of direct predecessors of [L]. Inverse splittings can
be applied only if α1 = α2. In this case, J′ = (1|4) and α′ = (α1). Every solution

which has to be read upwards. Since the L′ differ in the class ξ ′, they generate a
separate equivalence class each. Finally, since k1 = k2 = 1, inverse mergings cannot
be applied to L. Thus, in the case α1 = α2, the direct predecessors of the equivalence
class of L are labelled by the solutions of equations (8.8.7), whereas in the case
α1 ̸= α2 direct predecessors do not exist. Recall that the ﬁrst case can only occur if
P is trivial.
♦
Example 8.8.8 Let P be a principal SU(2)-bundle. We shall construct the partially
ordered set ˆK(P), starting from its maximal element.
Let L0 denote the unique representative of the maximal element of ˆK(P). Since
the latter corresponds to P itself, L0 is given by J0 = (2|1), α0 = c(P) and ξ0 = 0.
Inverse mergings yield the following elements L:

Here, αi = 1 + αi,1 such that α1α2 = c(P). Sorting by degree yields the equations
α1,1 + α2,1 = 0 and α1,1α2,1 = c2(P). The ﬁrst one implies α2,1 = −α1,1 and the

second one then reads
−α2
1,1 = c2(P) .
(8.8.8)
The solutions α1,1 and −α1,1 yield equivalent direct predecessors.6
Next, we determine the direct predecessors of the classes generated by L. Inverse
mergings cannot be applied. Inverse splittings can be applied provided α1 = α2. In
this case, every solution ξ ′ ∈H1

and each of these elements generates a separate equivalence class. Clearly, J′ = (1|2)
labels the center Z2 of SU(2) and ξ ′ is the natural characteristic class provided
by Theorem 4.8.3 of the corresponding reduction. In particular, L′ does not have
predecessors and we are done.
Let us present the Hasse diagram of the partially ordered set ˆK(P) for the base
manifolds M = S4, S2 × S2 and L3
2p × S1. In a Hasse diagram, vertices stand for the
elements of the partially ordered set and edges indicate the relation 'left vertex ≤
right vertex'. When viewing the elements of ˆK(P) as Howe subbundles, the vertex
on the right hand side represents the class corresponding to P itself, whereas the
vertices in the middle and on the left hand side represent reductions of P to the Howe
subgroups U(1) and Z2, respectively. When viewing the elements of ˆK(P) as orbit
types, or strata of the gauge orbit space, the vertex on the right hand side represents
the generic stratum, whereas the vertices in the middle and on the left hand side
represent the secondary strata.
1. M = S4. If c2(P) = 0, Eq.(8.8.8) is trivially satisﬁed by α1,1 = 0. Then,
Eq.(8.8.9) is trivially satisﬁed by ξ ′ = 0. Since H1
Z2(M) = 0 and H2
Z(M) = 0,
there are no further solutions for either one. Thus, in the case where P is trivial,
the Hasse diagram of ˆK(P) is
6We note that the Howe subgroup labelled by J = (1, 1|1, 1) is the toral subgroup U(1) of SU(2)
and that α1,1 is just the ﬁrst Chern class of the corresponding reduction of P. By virtue of this
transliteration, Eq.(8.8.8) is consistent with the literature [338].

8.8 Partial Ordering
691
If P is nontrivial, ˆK(P) consists only of the class corresponding to P itself. On the
level of strata, this result means that in the sector of vanishing topological charge
the gauge orbit space decomposes into the generic stratum, a U(1)-stratum, and
an SU(2)-stratum. If, on the other hand, a topological charge is present, then only
the generic stratum survives.
2. M = S2 × S2. Choosing a generator of H2
Z(M) and expanding α1,1 and c2(P) as
in Remark 8.6.17/2, Eq.(8.8.8) yields
−4ab = c ,
cf. (8.6.30). Since H1
Z2(M) = 0, only the solution a = b = 0 has a direct
predecessor. Thus, if c2(P) = 0, the Hasse diagram of ˆK(P) is
(2,0)
(1,0)
(0,0)
(0,1)
(0,2)
The vertices in the middle are labelled by the corresponding values of (a, b). Note
that passage to equivalence classes requires that solutions (a, b) and (−a, −b)
are identiﬁed. If c = 2l, the Hasse diagram is
(1,−l)
(q,−l/q)
(l,−1)
where, according to the identiﬁcation (a, b) ∼(−a, −b), q runs through the
positivedivisorsofl only.Finally,ifc isodd, ˆK(P)hasoneelement,corresponding
to P itself.
3. M = L3
2p × S1. The relevant cohomology groups of L3
2p are given in Remark
8.6.17/3. Let γ L
1 and γ L
2 be generators of H1
Zg(L3

Z(L3

In addition, choose a generator γ S

Zg(M) = Z⟨2p,g⟩⊕Z2p is

The Gauge Orbit Space
First, consider Eq.(8.8.8). Since H2
Z2p(L3
2p) is torsion, we have α2
1 = 0. Hence,
(8.8.8) admits a solution iff c2(P) = 0. In this case, the solutions are given by
a ∈Z2p. Since when passing to equivalence classes we have to identify a with
−a, the direct predecessors are labelled by a = 0, . . . , p.
Now, consider Eq.(8.8.9). According to (8.8.10), in the present situation it reads
p ξ ′
L = a. Thus, only the elements labelled by a = 0 and a = p have direct
predecessors. These are given by the values ξ ′
L = 0, ξ ′
S = 0, 1 and ξ ′
L = 1,
ξ ′
S = 0, 1, respectively. As a result, if c2(P) = 0, the Hasse diagram of ˆK(P) is
(0,0)
(0,1)
(1,0)
(1,1)

p −1

Here the vertices on the left hand side are labelled by (ξ ′

the middle are labelled by a. If c2(P) ̸= 0, then ˆK(P) is trivial.

Chapter 9
Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
In this chapter, we discuss some elements of quantum gauge theory with the main
emphasis on those aspects which are related to the structure of the classical gauge
orbit space in one or the other way. In Sects.9.1 and 9.2, we present the classical
Faddeev-Popov path integral quantization procedure, address the famous Gribov
problem and formulate the latter in the language of differential geometry. In this
formulation, the problem boils down to the study of the obstruction against the
existence of a global section (a global gauge) of the generic stratum of the gauge
orbit space. Following Singer, we prove that for some model classes, there does not
exist any global gauge at all. Next, in Sect.9.3, we discuss another general aspect
of quantum gauge theories. It turns out that a symmetry of the classical Lagrangian
of a gauge model is not necessarily maintained on quantum level. If this happens,
one speaks of an anomaly. We discuss this phenomenon for models of gauge ﬁelds
coupled to fermionic matter. We address Abelian and gauge anomalies in detail and
comment on global anomalies at the end. The discussion is based on the path integral
formulation and heavily uses the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem.
In the second part of this chapter, we present some of our results on non-
perturbative quantum gauge theory for (ﬁnite) lattice models in the Hamiltonian
framework. In Sect.9.4, we construct the quantum model via canonical quantization
and in Sect.9.5 we derive the ﬁeld algebra and the observable algebra of the system.
We show that, for the ﬁnite lattice model, these algebras are uniquely deﬁned up to
equivalence. We discuss the Gauß law, indicate how to classify irreducible repre-
sentations of the observable algebra in terms of global colour charge and, ﬁnally,
also comment on recent results for the inﬁnite lattice model. In Sect.9.6, we explain
how to include the nongeneric gauge orbit strata on quantum level. This presen-
tation is based upon the concept of a Hilbert space costratiﬁcation in the sense of
Huebschmann and uses the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform of Hall. Finally,
in Sect.9.7, we discuss the costratiﬁcation for a toy model.

Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
9.1
Path Integral Quantization
In this section, we limit our attention to the principal orbit type τ = τp, which is the
conjugacy class consisting of the subgroup ˜Z(G) of constant functions P →Z(G),
where Z(G) denotes the center of G. As already noted, since ˜Z(G) is normal in G ,
the smooth locally trivial ﬁbre bundle
πp : C p →M p
(9.1.1)
is in fact principal with structure group

G := G /˜Z(G) .
This bundle has been studied intensively [454, 455, 476, 591]. For convenience, we
assume that ˜Z(G) is discrete. Thus, LG = L ˜
G .
Below, we will describe a procedure for quantizing a gauge theory within the
functional integral approach which was proposed in 1967 by Faddeev and Popov
[188], building on earlier work by Feynman [194, 195] and De Witt [151]. Basically,
the functional integral obtained in this way1 serves as a tool for perturbation theory,
see e.g. [340]. In this approach, effects which potentially may come from the possible
nontriviality of the bundle P over spacetime M where the gauge connections live on
are not taken into account. Thus, we will represent the gauge connections ω by their
local representatives A on M. As before, the local representative of the ﬁeld strength
will be denoted by F. Moreover, we pass from spacetime to Euclidean space, also
denoted by M, and consider the functional integral there. This step is achieved by
replacing real time t by imaginary time it.
Thus, the starting point is the Euclidean Yang-Mills action
SYM(A) = 1

(9.1.3)
Here, [dA] :=  dA(x) is the formal measure on C p and

M J · A is called the
source term. For the time being, let us drop it.3
The Faddeev-Popov procedure may be written down for the theory on physical
spacetime as well. Anyway, the above functional integral is not deﬁned rigorously.
1Combined with the machinery of renormalization, see [532, 556, 656] and references therein.
2For the time being, we neglect matter ﬁelds. They will be included in Sect.9.3. For convenience,
the Planck constant ℏis set equal to 1.
3Note that this term is not gauge-invariant.

9.1 Path Integral Quantization
695
Passing to the Euclidean space is the ﬁrst step in the constructive programme of
quantum ﬁeld theory. Before we continue, let us brieﬂy outline the main steps of this
programme.
Remark 9.1.1 (Non-perturbative quantum gauge theory) In the programme of con-
structive quantum ﬁeld theory, one proceeds as follows.
1. Approximate the underlying classical ﬁeld theory on a ﬁnite lattice in Euclidean
space.
2. Quantize this system via the functional integral approach. This way, one obtains
a rigorously deﬁned ﬁnite-dimensional quantum statistical model.4
3. Construct the continuum limit of this theory. This includes both passing to an
inﬁnite lattice (thermodynamical limit) and passing with the lattice spacing to 0
(ultraviolet limit). In particular, this way, one constructs the measure in the func-
tional integral and, consequently, the Euclidean Green's functions (Schwinger
functions) rigorously.
4. Use Osterwalder-Schrader type arguments [497, 498] to pass to the model on
Minkowski space, the ultimate goal being the construction of Wightman functions
fulﬁlling the Wightman axioms [275, 605].
For some types of models, this programme has been fully accomplished, see e.g.
[192, 586]. However, for gauge theories on 4-dimensional spacetime this is still an
(extremely hard) open problem. As a matter of fact, it is one of the famous Millennium
problems formulated by the Clay Mathematics Institute, see [160, 347] for details
and references to the main results obtained in this ﬁeld. In this context, we also refer
to the textbooks [248, 532].
Alternatively, one may try to develop a rigorous approach within the Hamiltonian
framework. Here, one starts with an inﬁnite-dimensional Hamiltonian system with
a symmetry (the gauge symmetry) and one may try to develop a rigorous quantum
theory by possibly extending methods working for ﬁnite-dimensional systems to
the inﬁnite-dimensional context. Again, lattice approximation may be helpful as an
intermediate step. In Sect.9.4, we will explain the ﬁnite lattice version of gauge
theory in some detail. Clearly, the above problem does not become simpler by just
passing to the Hamiltonian framework. But, as a matter of fact, different methods of
functional analysis, in particular, spectral theory and operator algebras, play a role
here. In this context, we refer to a series of deep papers by Bach, Fröhlich and Sigal,5
see the review [49] and further references therein. We also refer to [48, 50] for further
developments.
♦
Now, disregarding the hard problems discussed in the above remark, let us explain
the Faddeev-Popov procedure in some detail. To start with, let us assume that the
principal bundle (9.1.1) is trivial. Obstructions against this property will be discussed
4Combined with appropriate computer methods, like Monte-Carlo simulation, this also serves as a
tool for non-perturbative calculations in elementary particle physics, see [143, 233, 536].
5These authors have studied the theory of non-relativistic electrons bound to static nuclei and
interacting with the quantized radiation ﬁeld in the Hamiltonian approach on a rigorous level.

Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
later. In this case, we can choose a global section s : M p →C p, called a gauge.
Clearly, s can be deﬁned by a local gauge ﬁxing condition
f (A) = 0 ,
where f : C p →LG is a smooth mapping whose restriction to
im(s) =

A ∈C p : f (A) = 0

is of maximal rank.6 Then, by an inﬁnite-dimensional version of the Level Set The-
orem, f determines s uniquely, indeed.
Remark 9.1.2 We have met already a number of gauge ﬁxing conditions in the
previous chapters. In view of the natural splitting (8.3.1), the covariant Lorenz gauge
deﬁned by
f (A) = ∇A∗(A −A)
(9.1.4)
is somewhat distinguished. Here, A ∈C p is referred to as the background gauge
potential. Another gauge popular in the context of functional integrals is the axial
gauge. It is deﬁned by
f (A) = n · A ,
(9.1.5)
where n ∈M is a ﬁxed vector. We will further comment on axial-like gauges below.
♦
Now, Faddeev and Popov proposed to implement the gauge ﬁxing deﬁned by s in
the functional integral and, thus, to remove the unphysical gauge freedom from the
naive functional integral (9.1.3) as follows. By the assumption on f , the restriction
to im(s) of the derivative of f in the vertical direction,
f ′
[A] : Vs([A]) →LG ,
is an isomorphism for every [A] ∈M p. Recall from Sect.6.1 that the distribution
V is spanned by the Killing vector ﬁelds of the G -action,
VA = ∇A(LG ) ,
and, thus, Vs([A]) may be identiﬁed with LG . Thus, for every [A] ∈M p, we have
an isomorphism f ′
[A] ◦∇s([A]) : LG →LG . Clearly, this is the derivative of the
mapping
Φ[A] : ˜
G →LG ,
Φ[A](u) = f

A(u)	
,
6By Proposition 1.1.6, s uniquely determines an equivariant mapping κ : C →G . Given κ, one can
take f := κ′. But, clearly, s does not determine f uniquely.

9.1 Path Integral Quantization

where A = s([A]) and A(u) is the local gauge transformation of A generated by
u ∈G , see (6.1.3). That is,
Φ′
[A] = f ′
[A] ◦∇s([A]) .
(9.1.6)
Note that for the covariant Lorenz gauge (9.1.4), Φ′
[A] coincides with the
Faddeev-Popov operator as given by (8.4.8). Therefore, we call Φ′
[A] the (general-
ized) Faddeev-Popov operator. As a consequence, formally, we now can generalize
the standard formula


Φ′
[A]
	

↾f (A)=0
(9.1.8)
and call it the Faddeev-Popov determinant. Inserting the identity (9.1.7) into the
generating function (9.1.3) with J = 0 and using the gauge invariance of [dA],
Δ f (A) and SYM(A), we obtain

The volume

also adding the source term again, we ﬁnally get

M dxJ(x)·A(x) .
(9.1.9)
This is an integral over the gauge ﬁxing submanifold im(s).
Remark 9.1.3
1. In the covariant Lorenz gauge, using (8.4.26), one can rewrite (9.1.9) as an integral
over the gauge orbit space with the volume form induced from the natural weak
Riemannian metric on M p. We refer to [46, 349] for further details, see also [234]
for a rigorous study on the lattice.
2. If we choose a system of local coordinates {xi} on M, a basis {ea} in the Lie
algebra of G and a local frame {ξ a} in LG ∼= W k+1(Ad(P)), then Φ′
[A] may be
represented by a matrix-valued distribution as follows.7
7We use the notation of functional derivative as common in physics.

Clearly, this is the local form of (9.1.6). For the gauges given in Remark 9.1.2,

(9.1.12)
♦
To make formula (9.1.9) tractable for perturbative calculations, one represents the
Faddeev-Popov determinant in terms of a Berezin integral [66],8
Δ f (A) =

[dc][dc]e

dx dy ca(x)Qab(x,y)cb(y) ,
(9.1.13)
where c and c are Graßmann-valued Lorentz scalars carrying the adjoint representa-
tion of the Lie algebra of G. They are called Faddeev-Popov ghosts and anti-ghosts,
respectively.9 Finally, one usually gets rid of the δ-distribution by averaging over
an arbitrary auxiliary ﬁeld with a Gaussian weight. This way the δ-distribution gets
replaced by a factor
8Here, we temporarily assume that the determinant is positive. Consequently we neglect the absolute
value.
9This naming goes back to Feynman. It is due to the fact that c and c do not contribute to the spectrum
of observables of the quantum theory. In the language of perturbation theory, these quantities cannot
occur in external lines of Feynman diagrams.

(9.1.16)
Correspondingly, using Z(J), one deﬁnes the Euclidean n-point Green's functions
(Schwinger functions).
Remark 9.1.4 Clearly, there are now various gauges corresponding to various
choices of α. In particular, the case α = 1 is usually referred to as the Feynman
gauge. The choice α = 0 is called the Landau gauge. Note that in this case the width
of the Gaussian weight vanishes and so we are actually back to the Lorenz gauge
d∗A = 0.10
♦
By the above gauge ﬁxing procedure, the local gauge symmetry has been broken.
However, a new symmetry occurs. To exhibit it, we further rewrite the functional
integral (9.1.14) as
Z(J) =

[dA][dB][dc][dc] e−

SYM(A)+ ˜Sg f (A,B,c,c)

The functional integral (9.1.14) is reobtained by integrating out the B-ﬁeld. Con-
sider the following transformation of φ = (A, B, c, c) :
δλAa
μ = λDa
μbcb ,
δλBa = 0 ,
δλca = −λBa ,
δλca = −1
2λf a
bdcbcd ,
where λ is a constant parameter which anti-commutes with the ghost ﬁelds (and with
all fermionic matter ﬁelds of the theory) and f abd are the structure constants of the
Lie algebra of G. For any functional F of φ, one deﬁnes the Slavnov variation sF
by
δλF(φ) := λ

sF(φ)
	
.
By deﬁnition, s is an odd derivation. One can prove that it is nilpotent and, using this
fact, one shows that the effective action SY M + ˜Sg f is s-invariant.11 The symmetry
obtained this way was found independently by Becchi, Rouet and Stora [62] and by
Tyutin [635] and it is, therefore, referred to as the BRST symmetry. It constitutes the
basic technical tool both for the proof of the renormalizability and of the unitarity
of Yang-Mills theory in the perturbative approach. For these topics we refer to the
standard literature, see [656].
9.2
The Gribov Problem
Unfortunately, in general, the procedure explained in the previous section does not
work globally. That is, there are obstructions against the existence of a global gauge
section s : M p →C p. This observation was ﬁrst made by Gribov [258] in 1978in
the context of the Lorenz gauge d∗A = B, see Remark 9.1.4. He showed that a
gauge orbit can intersect a Lorenz gauge section more than once.12 To understand
the geometry of this phenomenon, we proceed in two steps:
(a) We reformulate the arguments of Gribov in the geometric language.
(b) Following Singer [591], we show that, in general, there does not exist any global
gauge ﬁxing at all.
To discuss point (a), we denote
Sω := {ω + α : α ∈Hω}
(9.2.1)
11For a detailed proof of these facts we refer to Volume II of [656].
12As a matter of fact, he also mentioned the possibility that some orbits may not intersect a chosen
gauge at all, but he seemingly was not aware of any example. This can happen, indeed, e.g. in the
axial gauge with periodic boundary conditions, see [684].

9.2 The Gribov Problem

for any ω ∈C p. We keep on assuming that the metric g on spacetime M has
Euclidean signature, but now we additionally assume that M is compact. Below, stan-
dard examples will be M = S4 or S3 which may be viewed as being obtained from
Euclidean space via a one-point compactiﬁcation.13
Proposition 9.2.1 (Singer) Let ω0 ∈C p. Then, for every line ω0 + tα ∈Sω0, there
exists a vector τ ∈Hω0 which is tangent to the orbit at ω0 + t0α for some t0 ∈R.
Proof The tangent space to the orbit at ω0 + tα is spanned by elements of the form
∇ω0+tαξ =

∇ω0 + tCα
	
ξ with ξ ∈LG and Cα given by Cαξ = [α, ξ]. Thus, a vector
τ ∈Hω0 is tangent to the orbit at ω0 + tα iff there exists ξ ∈LG such that
τ =

∇ω0 + tCα
	
ξ .
(9.2.2)
Together with ∇ω0∗τ = 0, this implies

∇ω0∗∇ω0 + t∇ω0∗◦Cα
	
ξ = 0 .
Now, since g is positive deﬁnite, ∇ω0∗∇ω0 is a self-adjoint positive operator. More-
over, since the symbol of the self-adjoint operator ∇ω0∗◦Cα is not non-negative, this
operator is not non-negative. Thus, there exists a smallest ﬁnite value t0 ∈R such
that the operator
Pω0(t0) := ∇ω0∗∇ω0 + t0∇ω0∗◦Cα
has a nontrivial kernel. Any element ξ belonging to that kernel yields via (9.2.2) an
element τ which is tangent to the orbit at ω0 + t0α.
■
Remark 9.2.2 (Gribov ambiguity) The connection ω0 + t0α is said to be on the
Grivov horizon around ω0 in the direction α. At every point of this horizon, there
exists a vector from Hω0 which is tangent to the orbit through that point. Moreover,
the operator Pω0(t0) coincides with the Faddeev-Popov operator Δω0ω, where ω =
ω0 + t0α.Thus,extendedtotheGrivovhorizon,theFaddeev-Popovoperatorhaszero
modes and, consequently, the Faddeev-Popov determinant vanishes on the horizon.
This means that this determinant can switch sign and, thus, the Faddeev-Popov
procedure fails. In the language of geodesics, the exponential mapping around ω0
becomes singular at the horizon.
♦
Now, let us turn to point (b). In [591], Singer has shown that for some spacetime
manifolds the bundle (9.1.1) is nontrivial and thus there does not exist any global
gaugeﬁxingatall.Theideaoftheproofgoesasfollows.First,showthatthehomotopy
13Which may be implied by the requirement of considering ﬁnite energy ﬁeld conﬁgurations only,
cf. Chap.6. More generally speaking, passing to a compact manifold may be viewed as the intro-
duction of an infrared cutoff needed as an intermediate step for a non-perturbative understanding of
Yang-Mills theory. In this spirit, as already mentioned by Gribov himself, the Gribov problem is
likely to be related to non-perturbative problems like the quark conﬁnement problem.

groups of the principal stratum C p vanish. Assume that the bundle (9.1.1) were trivial.
Then,
C p ∼= M p × 
G .
Since πi(C p) = 0, we could conclude that the homotopy groups πi( 
G ) vanish for
i ≥1. Since in many cases this is not true, it follows that in these cases (9.1.1) is
nontrivial. Below, we present Singer's arguments in some detail.
Proposition 9.2.3 The homotopy groups of the principal stratum C p vanish.
Proof Let ω ∈B := C \C p. Then, by Remark 8.8.6/2, the orbit type τ of ω has
ﬁnitely many successors τ1, . . . , τr ̸= p with respect to the partial ordering.14 By the
Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem and formula (8.3.10), there exists a neighbourhood
U of ω such that U ⊂C ≥τ. It follows that
U \B = U \

C ≤τ1 ∪· · · ∪C ≤τr 	
.
The subsets C ≤τi are afﬁne subspaces. Since they have inﬁnite codimension in C ,
there exists an inﬁnite dimensional afﬁne subspace which is orthogonal to all C ≤τi.
By a standard deformation argument, it follows that π j(U \B) = 0 for all j. Now,
let f : ∂Δl+1 →C p be a continuous mapping representing an element of πl(C p).
Since C is afﬁne, f can be extended to a continuous mapping ˜f : Δl+1 →C . By
the Simplicial Approximation Theorem, there exists a subdivision of Δl+1 and a
homotopic mapping ˜g : Δl+1 →C such that ˜g maps each subsimplex to either C p
or to some U . Since π j(U \B) = 0 for all these U , by induction on the dimension
of the skeleta of the subdivision, we can deform ˜g homotopically in such a way that it
takes values in C p. The deformed mapping induces a homotopy from f to a constant
mapping ∂Δl+1 →C p.
■
From now on, we limit our attention to G = SU(n). For some chosen point m ∈
M, consider the pointed gauge group15
Gm := {u ∈G : u(m) = 1} .
Lemma 9.2.4 For M = Sr, the pointed gauge group Gm is weakly homotopy equiv-
alent to the space of continuous mappings (Sr, m) →(SU(n), 1) endowed with the
compact-open topology.16 Moreover, for all j,
π j(Gm) ∼= π j+r(SU(n)) .
(9.2.3)
14See Sect.8.8.
15Here, we view u ∈G as a section of the associated bundle P ×G G, cf. Remark 6.1.2.
16See Sect.3.1.

9.2 The Gribov Problem
703
Proof Let m = e0 be the north pole of Sr and let Sr
+ and Sr
−denote the upper and
the lower hemisphere, respectively. Elements u of Gm correspond to pairs of W k+1-
mappings u± : Sr
± →SU(n) fulﬁlling
u+(e0) = 1 ,
u−(x) = ρ(x) · u+(x) · ρ(x)−1
(9.2.4)
for all x on the equator Sr−1, where ρ denotes the transition mapping of a chosen
pair of local trivializations. Consider the homomorphism
ϕ : Gm →W k+1
(Sr
+, e0), (SU(n), 1)
	
,
ϕ(u) := u+ .
Its kernel is ker(ϕ) = {u ∈Gm : u+ = 1}. By (9.2.4), the assignment u →u−de-
ﬁnes a mapping
ker(ϕ) →W k+1
(Sr
−, Sr−1), (SU(n), 1)
	
,
(9.2.5)
which clearly is an isomorphism. Since the group W k+1
(Sr
+, e0), (SU(n), 1)
	
is
contractible, the natural inclusion mapping ker(ϕ) →Gm is a weak homotopy equiv-
alence. Composing this with the isomorphism (9.2.5) and identifying
W k+1
(Sr
−, Sr−1), (SU(n), 1)
	 ∼= W k+1
(Sr, e0), (SU(n), 1)
	
,
we obtain a weak homotopy equivalence
Gm ∼W k+1
(Sr, e0), (SU(n), 1)
	
.
Finally, using the Smoothing Homotopy Theorem, one can check that the natural in-
clusion mapping W k+1
(Sr, e0), (SU(n), 1)
	
→C

(Sr, e0), (SU(n), 1)
	
is a weak
homotopy equivalence, too. This yields the ﬁrst assertion. The second assertion fol-
lows by iterated application of Theorem 3.1.5/2.
■
Remark 9.2.5 The ﬁrst assertion of Lemma 9.2.4 carries over to arbitrary compact
manifolds of dimension r ≤4. Indeed, for r < 4, P is trivial, which means that
Gm = W k+1
(M, m), (SU(n), 1)
	
. For r = 4, SU(n)-bundles P are classiﬁed by the
second Chern class c2(P). Hence, one may apply the argument for S4 to all elements
of a set of generators of H 4
Z(M).
♦
The following propositions are simple generalizations of Theorem 3 in [591].
Proposition 9.2.6 Let M = Sr with r ≥2 and assume n > r/2. Then, π1( ˜
G ) ̸= 0.
Proof The exact homotopy sequences of the principal bundles Zn →G →˜
G and
Gm →G →SU(n) are given by
· · · −→πk(Zn) −→πk(G ) −→πk( ˜
G ) −→πk−1(Zn) −→· · ·

Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
First, consider the piece
π1( ˜
G ) −→π0(Zn) = Zn −→π0(G )
(9.2.8)
of (9.2.6). Since π0(SU(n)) = π1(SU(n)) = 0, exactness of (9.2.7) and Lemma
9.2.4 imply that for M = Sr we have
π0(G ) = π0(Gm) = πr(SU(n)) .
For n > r/2 and r ≥2, πr(SU(n)) = 0 or Z, see e.g. [104], Example VII.8.5. In the
ﬁrst case, exactness of (9.2.8) implies that π1( ˜
G ) ̸= 0. Since the only homomorphism
Zn →Z is the trivial one, π1( ˜
G ) ̸= 0 must hold in the second case, too.
■
Proposition 9.2.6 covers the cases S2 and S3 for any n and S4 for n > 2. For S4 and
n = 2, we need another argument.
Proposition 9.2.7 Let M = S4 and n = 2. Then, π3( ˜
G ) ̸= 0.
Proof Consider the piece
π3(G ) −→π3

SU(2)
	
= Z −→π2(Gm)
of (9.2.7). By exactness of (9.2.6), π3(G ) = π3( ˜
G ) and by Lemma 9.2.4,
π2(Gm) = π6(SU(2)) = Z12 .
Since there is no injective homomorphism Z →Z12, we conclude that π3( ˜
G ) ̸= 0.
■
Remark 9.2.8
1. By Propositions 9.2.6 and 9.2.7, the Gribov problem occurs on S2, S3 and S4 for
every unitary group SU(n).
2. Using general results on the structure of the mapping space C(M, G) for M being
a product of spheres, Killingback [376] has shown that the Gribov ambiguity is
also present in SU(n)-gauge theory on the 4-torus and in SU(2)-gauge theory on
S2 × S2.
♦
We emphasize once again that the whole discussion above is limited to the principal
stratum.
Finally, we comment on attempts to overcome the Gribov ambiguity.
(a) One approach consists in trying to reformulate the functional integral explicitly
in terms of local gauge invariant quantities, see e.g. [366, 372] and references
therein. In the process of constructing local gauge invariants, topologically non-
trivial conﬁgurations show up in a natural way. Typically, they are of magnetic

monopole or magnetic vortex type, leading to a hydrodynamical picture of mat-
ter.17 There were many speculations on the usefulness of such a formulation for
the proof of quark conﬁnement, see the papers of Mandelstam [421] and 't Hooft
[624-626]. According to these authors, a non-Abelian gauge model with matter
ﬁelds may exhibit various phases:
• a Georgi-Glashow phase containing photons, charged particles and magnetic
monopoles,
• a superconductivity phase containing magnetic monopoles which are conﬁned
by magnetic vortices.
In [540], these phases have been analyzed for a model with gauge group SU(3).
Together with the classical paper of Montonen and Olive [457], the above papers
of 't Hooft and Mandelstam may be viewed as precursors of modern charge-
monopole duality, see also the discussion and the references at the beginning of
Sect.7.6. Finally, we also refer to the papers of Asorey and collaborators, see
[24, 25] and further references therein, which are close in spirit.
(b) Another approach, already suggested by Gribov in his classical paper [258],
was developed by Zwanziger [696-699]. Consider the covariant Lorenz gauge
(9.1.4) and deﬁne the Gribov region18
Ω =

A ∈C p : ∇A∗(A −A) = 0 , Φ′
[A] > 0

.
(9.2.9)
Equivalently, Ω may be viewed as the set of relative minima of the family of
Morse functionals μA deﬁned by
μA(ρ) = ∥A(ρ) −A∥2 .
Indeed,
δμA
δρ

δ2μA
δρ2

↾ρ=1
= −2∇A∗∇A ,
showing that the Hessian of μ coincides with the Faddeev-Popov operator. Using
this, it was shown that every gauge orbit intersects with the Gribov region.
Moreover, it was proven that Ω is a convex set bounded in every direction.
Unfortunately,Ω stillcontainsGribovcopies[581].Toimprovethesituation,one
passes to the subset ˆΩ ⊂Ω, called the fundamental modular domain, consisting
17For electrodynamics interacting with matter ﬁelds, such a hydrodynamical description was found
already in the nineteen ﬁfties, see the classical paper of Takabayashi [607]. We also refer to [367,
370, 371] and further references therein.
18One can consider different gauges. In particular, an axial-like gauge on the torus has been analyzed
in detail, see [401]. In this case, the fundamental modular domain was found to be an orbifold,
obtained by factorizing the Gribov region with respect to an inﬁnite discrete group.

of the absolute minima of the Morse functionals μA. That is, on every gauge
orbit one selects the gauge conﬁguration closest to the origin,
ˆΩ =

A ∈C p : ∇A∗(A −A) = 0 , μA(ρ) ≥μA(1) for all ρ ∈G

.
(9.2.10)
Again, ˆΩ is convex and bounded in every direction and all gauge orbits intersect
with ˆΩ. Moreover, the interior of ˆΩ contains at most one representative of each
gauge orbit. However, on the boundary ∂ˆΩ Gribov copies still can and do occur
[640, 641]. The general idea now consists in restricting the functional integral to
ˆΩ and arguing that the contributions from the boundary should be neglectable.
In this context, a lot of work has been done including case studies, numerical
simulations and, in particular, calculations within the lattice approximation. For
further reading we refer to the review [642].
9.3
Anomalies
In this section, we will meet another peculiar property of gauge theories. It turns out
that a symmetry of the classical Lagrangian is not necessarily maintained on quantum
level. If this happens, one speaks of an anomaly. We discuss this issue for models of
gauge ﬁelds coupled to fermionic matter. As before, we assume that spacetime M is
a compact four-dimensional manifold with Euclidean signature. Since we are going
to deal with spin structures, we assume moreover that the ﬁrst two Stiefel-Whitney
classes of M vanish. As explained in Sect.7.1, fermionic matter ﬁelds are classically
described in terms of sections of the canonical spinor bundle S (M) twisted with a
vector bundle E carrying a representation of the gauge group G and, possibly, some
further ﬂavour-type representation. In Chap.7, we have seen a number of relevant
examples of that type.
To pass to quantum theory, we use the concept of the functional integral as
explained in the ﬁrst section. In this approach, fermions are represented by anti-
commuting Graßmann-valued variables ψ and ψ taking values in sections of E.
As already mentioned in the ﬁrst section, the functional integration for Graßmann-
valued ﬁelds has been developed by Berezin [66, 67]. Using this concept, the (naive)
functional integral of a theory of gauge ﬁelds interacting with fermionic matter ﬁelds
reads
Z(0) =

[dA][dψ][dψ]e−SYM(A)−Smat(ψ,ψ,A) ,
(9.3.1)
where SYM(A) is given by (6.2.2). As before, we keep on representing the gauge
connections ω by their local representatives A, that is, we assume that the principal
gauge bundle P is trivial.19 If we assume that the matter ﬁelds are massless, the
matter ﬁeld action is of the form
19We will comment on the nontrivial bundle case on the way.

9.3 Anomalies
707
Smat(ψ, ψ, A) =

M
dx⟨ψ(x), D/ Aψ(x)⟩,
(9.3.2)
see (7.1.9), where D/ A is the Dirac operator of the twisted Dirac bundle E =
S (M) ⊗E. Beware that, while the canonical Hermitean scalar product for fermions
on Minkowski space is given by (5.3.55), for the Euclidean signature we have
⟨ψ, φ⟩= ψ†φ .
We keep on using the notation ψ, but here ψ = ψ†. Carrying out the fermionic
integration in (9.3.1) in the sense of Berezin yields a fermionic determinant. The
latter turns out to be the crucial object for the study of the question whether an
anomaly occurs with respect to a given classical symmetry. Below, we discuss two
types of anomalies in some detail: Abelian20 anomalies and gauge anomalies. Finally,
we add some remarks on global anomalies. For an exhaustive treatment of the subject,
including also gravitational anomalies, we refer to [74, 530]. We stress that anomlies
may also be discussed within the Hamiltonian approach, see [114, 187, 189, 448].
(a) Abelian Anomalies
We use the approach developed by Fujikawa [224-226] and combine it with the
Index Theorem. Consider the Dirac operator D/ A of a twisted Dirac bundle E =
S (M) ⊗E, locally given by
D/ Aψ = i

(9.3.5)
Now, consider the chiral transformations
ψ →eiαγ 5ψ ,
ψ →ψeiαγ 5 ,

(9.3.6)
Since γ μγ 5 + γ 5γ μ = 0, they leave the fermionic action invariant. For local chiral
transformations with functions x →α(x), the fermionic action transforms as (Exer-
cise 9.3.1)
20Also referred to as axial anomalies or as Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies [10, 65].

Now, let us study the behaviour of the fermionic functional integral

[dψ][dψ]e−Smat(ψ,ψ,A) = det(D/ A)
(9.3.9)
under chiral transformations.21 To ﬁnd the transformation of the measure, we ﬁrst
perform a formal calculation and then we introduce a gauge invariant regularization
making the calculation meaningful. By Propositions 5.7.4 and 5.7.11, D/ A is a self-
adjoint elliptic operator admitting a complete orthonormal basis ψ1, ψ2, . . . of L2(E )
consisting of eigenvectors, that is, D/ Aψn = λnψn. Moreover, the eigenspaces are all
ﬁnite-dimensional and limn→∞|λn| = ∞. Thus, we can expand

21By Appendix F, det(D/ A) must be viewed as a section of the determinant bundle Det(D/ A) over the
gauge orbit space, as will be explained later. However, it turns out that, for the study of the Abelian
anomaly, it is enough to consider det(D/ A) for a ﬁxed background ﬁeld A.

Since D/ A anti-commutes with γ 5, the spinor ﬁeld γ 5ψk is an eigenvector with eigen-
value −λk. Thus, by the orthogonality of the basis {ψk}, all contributions in (9.3.16)
coming from non-vanishing eigenvalues cancel and we obtain a reduction to the sum
over zero-modes. Next, since [γ 5, D/ A] = 2γ 5D/ A, restricted to the eigenspace of zero
modes, γ 5 and D/ A commute. Thus, this space decomposes into subspaces with ﬁxed

A = tr

Thus, by the heat kernel analysis in the proof of Theorem 5.8.14 leading to the Local
Index Theorem,23 viewing A as a differential form, we obtain
A = ˆA(M) ∧ch(E) .
(9.3.20)
In particular, for M = S4, we have ˆA(M) = 1 and the axial anomaly is given by the
second Chern class of E. Thus, for G = SU(n), we obtain

a classical background ﬁeld:

This is the classical result of Adler, Bell and Jackiw [10, 65],24

1. The above result does not depend on the concrete choice of the regularization as
given by (9.3.15). The factor e−Λ−1 D/ 2
A may be replaced by f

Λ−1 D/ 2

, where
f is any smooth function decreasing rapidly at inﬁnity. It is easy to see that this
choice yields the same anomaly [74, 224].
2. In perturbation theory, the above anomaly is found by a one-loop calculation
(axial-vector triangle diagram). It turns out that radiative corrections do not pro-
vide additional contributions to the anomaly. They merely result in a renormal-
ization of ﬁelds and charges. This deep result is due to Adler and Bardeen [11]
who carried out the analysis for spinor electrodynamics and for a σ-model. Later,
this result has been generalized to arbitrary gauge theories with fermionic matter
ﬁelds by various authors using various techniques, see e.g. [412, 429, 687]. So, it
is the Adler-Bardeen Theorem which guarantees that the above functional inte-
gral calculation, with the gauge potential treated as a classical background ﬁeld,
yields the correct anomaly.
♦
(b) Gauge Anomalies
Now, we consider invariance under local gauge transformations. In the same spirit
as before, if local gauge invariance cannot be maintained on quantum level, then we
speak of a gauge anomaly. A gauge anomalous theory should be discarded. We refer
to the classical papers [54, 85, 263, 603, 693, 695].
Locally, gauge transformations are given by
A →A(ρ) = ρ−1Aρ + ρ−1dρ ,
ψ →ψ(ρ) = ρ−1ψ ,
24When passing to Minkowski space, the −i in the formula below must be replaced by 1, for the
convention ε0123 = 1.

Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
cf. (6.1.3) and (7.1.8). Let D/ A : E →E be the Dirac operator of a twisted Dirac bun-
dle E = S (M) ⊗E. We have to study the behaviour of the fermionic determinant
of D/ A under local gauge transformations. To start with, we note that
D/ A(ρ) = ρ−1D/ Aρ .
This implies that D/ A(ρ) and D/ A have identical spectra and that, in particular,
ker

D/ A(ρ)
	
= ρ

ker(D/A)
	
.
That is, the index of D/ A viewed as an element of K(C )-theory, see Appendix E, is
equivariant under the action of G on C . Thus, it descends to an element of K(M )
where M = C /G is the gauge orbit space. As in the previous section, we limit
our attention to the principal stratum M p. By Appendix F, the Quillen determinant
det(D/ A) must be viewed as a section of the determinant bundle Det(D/ A) over M p.
If this bundle is trivial, then det(D/ A) can be globally represented by a C-valued
function and, then, no anomaly can occur.
First, consider the fermionic action Smat(ψ, ψ, A) =

M dx⟨ψ, D/ Aψ⟩. In the
physics literature, this case is referred to as the vector coupling. By Theorem 5.7.17,
D/ A is a Fredholm operator with index zero, that is, the index bundle of D/ A is
zero-dimensional. Thus, by Appendix F, the determinant bundle of D/ A is also zero-
dimensional and, consequently, no anomaly can occur.
In the remainder, let us consider the case where E has a natural Z2-grading induced
by the chirality operator γ 5. Accordingly, the Dirac operator decomposes into its
chirality components,
D/ A = D/ +
A + D/ −
A .
In physical models such as the standard model,25 we have parity violating fermionic
actions,
Smat(ψ, ψ, A) =

where σ is a representation of G and {ta} is a basis of the Lie algebra of G. On
classical level we have the conservation law
∇μ jμ = 0 .
In the sequel, for simplicity, we suppress the chirality index and write D/ A instead of
D/ +
A. We proceed along the lines of Atiyah and Singer [41]:
1. We show that the determinant of D/ A gives rise to an element [μ] of the ﬁrst de
Rham cohomology group of ˜
G . This element will be identiﬁed with the gauge
anomaly. We prove that [μ] is the transgression of the ﬁrst Chern class c1 of the
determinant line bundle.
2. Using the Atiyah-Singer Family Index Theorem, we express c1 in terms of the
characteristic classes of a universal principal bundle over M × M p and calculate
its transgression explicitly via secondary cohomology classes.
To accomplish point 1, choose a reference connection A0 such that D/ A0 has index
zero and consider the operator
PA := D/ †
A0D/ A : Γ ∞(S +(M) ⊗E) →Γ ∞(S +(M) ⊗E) ,
for any A ∈C p.
Remark 9.3.2 Assume M = S4 and G = SU(n). Then, by Theorem 4.8.8, principal
G-bundles P over M are classiﬁed by their second Chern class. But, by the Atiyah-
Singer Index Theorem, vanishing of the index of D/ A0 implies vanishing of the second
Chern class. We conclude that, in this case, the above assumption implies that P is
trivial.
♦
Since ind

D/ A0
	
= 0, by the deformation invariance of the index, we can pass to a
gauge potential A0 fulﬁlling ker

D/ A0
	
= 0 without violating the condition that the
index be zero. But, then, also the kernel of D/ †
A0 is empty. Thus, the determinant line
bundle of the family {PA} may be identiﬁed with Det

D/ A
	
. Under this identiﬁca-
tion, det(PA) gets identiﬁed with the Quillen determinant det(D/ A). Thus, instead of
studying the determinant of the family {D/ A}, we can study the section det(PA) of
the determinant bundle of{D/ A}.26 Note that, for every A ∈C , the operator PA is
elliptic with symbol ξ →|ξ|2. Thus, PA can only have a ﬁnite number of zero and
negative eigenvalues, that is, we are in the situation described in Appendix D, see
formula (D.4), and we can apply ζ-function regularization for det(PA).27 This way,
we obtain a section28
26In the language of physics, the above transformation results in a constant factor in front of the
functional integral, see [430] for further details.
27As mentioned in Appendix D, this regularization procedure may be extended to the case where
zero eigenvalues occur.
28Note that PA does not transform equivariantly under gauge transformations. Thus, the regularized
determinant will not be gauge invariant, that is, it does not descend to a function on M p.

quantity is referred to as the gauge anomaly.
Now, as an immediate consequence of the exact homotopy sequence of the prin-
cipal ˜
G -bundle C p →M p and Proposition 9.2.3, we have πi(M p) ∼= πi−1( ˜
G ). In
particular,
π1( ˜
G ) ∼= π2(M p) ,
(9.3.26)
where the isomorphism is given by the connecting homomorphism of this sequence.
Explicitly, this isomorphism is realized as follows: any 2-sphere Σ in M p may be
viewed as being obtained from projecting a disc D in C p whose boundary ∂D lies
completely in the gauge orbit of some reference point A. On the other hand, via
A the boundary ∂D deﬁnes a loop γ in ˜
G . The assignment Σ →γ descends to a
mapping π2(M p) →π1( ˜
G ) yielding the above isomorphism. Next, since Σ\π(γ )
is diffeomorphic to the interior of D, for the ﬁrst Chern class of the determinant line
bundle we obtain

(9.3.27)
Since C p is weakly contractible, the 2-form π∗c1 on C p is exact, that is, there exists
a 1-form β1 such that π∗c1 = dβ1. Thus, by Stokes' Theorem,

π∗c1 =

(9.3.28)
The restriction of β1 to the orbit through A is a closed 1-form t(c1) on ˜

referred to as the transgression of c1.
The following proof is along the lines of [430].
Proposition 9.3.3 The anomaly form μA is cohomologous to t(c1).
Proof As above, let γ be a loop in the ﬁbre through A. By the isomorphism (9.3.26),
there exists a disc D with ∂D = γ . Let Σ be the corresponding 2-sphere in M p

obtained by projecting D. Consider any loop ˜γ on Σ. Then, π−1( ˜γ ) is a loop in D
homotopic to γ . Thus, the winding number of the S1-valued function | f[A]|−1 f[A]
on γ coincides with the winding number of the S1-valued function |Φ[A]|−1Φ[A] on
˜γ . On the other hand, by standard arguments, for any loop γ in ˜

(9.3.30)

■
Remark 9.3.4 As announced in [41], one can give an analytic proof of Proposition
9.3.3 as well. For that purpose, view the restriction of the index bundle to any 2-sphere
Σ ⊂M p as being associated with the corresponding restriction of the principal ˜
G -
bundle C p →M p, take the connection induced from the natural connection Z given
by (8.4.16) and calculate c1 via its curvature. Formally, this quantity is given by
δ tr

D/ −1
A δA
	
and, thus, it transgresses to tr

D/ −1
A δA
	
. It is easy to see that the latter quantity
coincides with μA. This heuristics can be made precise via ζ-function regularization,
see Sect.4 in [593]. Note that the proof of Proposition 9.3.3 presented here has the
advantage of holding for any regularization.
♦
From now on, let us limit our attention to the case M = S4 and G = SU(n) with
n > 2. Then, by Remark 9.3.2, the principal SU(n)-bundle P is trivial. Using (9.2.3),
together with π1(SU(n)) = 0 = π2(SU(n)), from the exact sequence (9.2.7) we read
off
π1(G ) ∼= π5(SU(n)) = Z .
(9.3.31)
By Proposition 9.2.3 and by the fact that π4(SU(n)) = 0 for n > 2, we also have
π1(M p) ∼= π0( ˜
G ) = 0 .
(9.3.32)
Moreover, since π0(M p) = 0 for any ﬁxed isomorphism class of principal bundles
P, the Hurewicz Theorem implies

G ) = Z. Now, by the ﬁrst equa-
tionin (9.3.33),inthecaseunderconsideration,anontrivialanomalywilloccurunless
[μA] vanishes identically for some reasons. By (9.3.26), the second isomorphism in
(9.3.33) implies that, in the case under consideration, the transgression yields an
isomorphism
H 2
Z(M p) ∼= H 1
Z( ˜
G ) .
(9.3.34)
By Proposition 9.3.3, this isomorphism identiﬁes the ﬁrst Chern class of the deter-
minant line bundle with the anomaly.
Following Atiyah and Singer [41], we further proceed as follows. Consider the
action of ˜
G on P × C p, given by
(p, A) →(ϑρ(p), A(ρ)) ,
where p →ϑρ(p) denotes the vertical automorphism of P deﬁned by ρ ∈˜
G . Since
this action is free, it yields a principal ˜
G -bundle P × C p over
P = (P × C p)/ ˜
G .
Since the action of G on P × C p induced from the right principal action on P
commutes with the action of ˜
G , it descends to a free action on P and, thus, it deﬁnes
a principal G-bundle
P →M × M p .
We endow P × C p with a natural metric as follows. For (p, A) ∈P × C p, via
a standard Kaluza-Klein construction, the metrics on M and G together with the
connection A yield a metric on Tp P which we combine with the natural L2-metric
on TAC p to the product metric at (p, A). By construction, the latter is G × ˜
G -
invariant. Thus, it descends to a G-invariant metric on P. Taking the orthogonal
complement of the canonical vertical distribution on P with respect to this metric,
we obtain a connection τ on P. Analyzing this orthogonality condition, one easily
ﬁnds (Exercise 9.3.3)
τ[(p,A)] = [Ap + ZA] ,
[(p, A)] ∈P ,
(9.3.35)
with Z given by (8.4.16).
Remark 9.3.5 The pair (P, τ) is universal in the following sense [41]: assume Q is a
principal G-bundle over M × X, with X compact and Q↾M×x ∼= P for every x ∈X,
endowed with a ﬁbre connection τ Q on Q↾M×x for every x, which is continuous
with respect to x. Then, there exists a morphism Φ : Q →P inducing τ Q from τ.
Conversely, any mapping ϕ : X →M p provides a ﬁbre connection by pulling back
(P, τ) via id ×ϕ : M × X →M × M p.

First, let us calculate the curvature of τ. Recall that in the case under consideration
P is trivial.29 Thus, we can view A as a 1-form on M = S4 and, consequently,
τ is represented by a g-valued 1-form on M × M p. Consequently, we represent
its curvature by a g-valued 2-form Ω on M × M p. Clearly, Ω is given by its form
components Ω(2,0), Ω(1,1) and Ω(0,2), where the ﬁrst index refers to M and the second
one to M p. For convenience, in the lemma below, we represent Ω by a 2-form on
M × C p. Since P is trivial, we can identify tangent vectors at C p with elements of
Ω1(M) ⊗g.

Proof Equation (9.3.36) is obvious. To prove (9.3.37), extend X ∈Tm M to a vector
ﬁeld X ∈X(M) and α to a Z-horizontal vector ﬁeld (also denoted by α) on C p,
that is, D∗
˜Aα = 0 for all ˜A in C p. Then, by the Structure Equation, there is only one

To calculate the right hand side, we represent (0, α) by the Z-horizontal curve s →

Clearly, Ω given by Lemma 9.3.6 descends to a 2-form on M × M p, which we
denote by the same letter. Next we apply the Atiyah-Singer Family Index Theorem
to the ﬁbration
M × M p →M p .
For M = S4 and G = SU(n), formula (5.8.68) takes the form
ch(Ind(D/ A)) =

S4 ch(E) ,
(9.3.39)
where E = P ×G Cn with SU(n) acting in the basic representation. In particular,
this yields an explicit formula for the ﬁrst Chern class c1 of the determinant line

(9.3.40)
where the double index refers to taking the form degree 4 on M and 2 on M p. Using
Lemma 9.3.6, one obtains an explicit formula for c1. Here, we are only interested in
the transgression [μA] of c1. To calculate [μA] explicitly, we use standard secondary
cohomology class techniques, see [130]. Since the following observations hold for
all Chern classes of P, let us consider the general case. Denote
d2 j :=

S4 k j+2(Ω)(4,2 j) .
Lift the closed 2 j-forms d2 j from M p to C p. Since C p is weakly contractible, the
lifted forms are exact. That is, there exist (2 j −1)-forms β2 j−1 on C p such that
π∗d2 j = δβ2 j−1 ,
withδ denotingthedifferentialonC p.Moreover,bytransgressionasexplainedabove,
the restriction t2 j−1 of β2 j−1 to the orbit through a chosen reference connection A
is a closed (2 j −1)-form on ˜
G . Applying the technique of secondary characteristic
classes, one can calculate β2 j−1 and t2 j−1 in terms of differential forms, up to exact
forms. In detail, the lift of k j+n(Ω) from M × M p to P coincides with the exterior
differential of the secondary characteristic class30 α2 j+3 and, according to formula
(3.1) in [130], this quantity is given by

Let ˜α2 j+3(τ) be the lift of α2 j+3(τ) to P × C p. Embedding M ⊂P via a global
section and integrating, we obtain a (2 j −1)-form on C p,


S4 ˜α2 j+3(τ) .
Let ˜t2 j−1 be its restriction to the orbit through A. By construction,
d ˜β2 j−1 = d2 j .
Moreover, ˜t1 is a transgression of c1 and, thus, it represents the anomaly [μA]. Thus,
it remains to calculate the restriction of

S4 ˜α5(τ)
to the ﬁbre through A. For that purpose, we need the restrictions ˆτ and ˆΩt of τ
and Ωt, respectively, to a chosen ﬁbre. First, since the restriction to the ﬁbres of a
connection form on a principal bundle may be identiﬁed with the Maurer-Cartan
form on the structure group, the restriction of τ to the ﬁbre through A is given by
ˆτ = A + η ,
(9.3.43)
where η is the Maurer-Cartan form on ˜
G . The latter is a 1-form on ˜
G with values in
the Lie algebra L ˜
G . Since P is trivial, it may be identiﬁed with a 1-form on ˜
G with
values in Ω0(M, g). Next, by Lemma 9.3.6, we have ˆΩ = F and, thus,

one can check that the second term is a contraction with Dabc as well. Thus, unless
Dabc vanishes identically, there is a nontrivial gauge anomaly. If Dabc = 0, then
one speaks of a safe theory. Note that, for any unitary representation of G, the
coefﬁcients Dabc are imaginary. Thus, for all real or pseudo-real representations,
these coefﬁcients vanish and, consequently, no anomaly occurs for Lie algebras
having only representations of that type. This happens for so(2n + 1), so(4n) with
n ≥2, sp(n) for n ≥3, G2, F4, E7 and E8. In particular, this is true for su(2) ∼=
so(3). Moreover, there are some Lie algebras for which the coefﬁcients Dabc
vanish even though they admit representations which are neither real nor pseudo-
real. This happens for so(4n + 2) (except for so(2) ∼= u(1) and so(6) ∼= su(4))
and for E6. As a result, anomalies are only possible if G contains SU(n)-factors
with n ≥3 or U(1)-factors. Fortunately, for the case of the standard model where
we have G = SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) the coefﬁcients Dabc vanish, see Sect.22.4
in Volume II of [656] for a detailed proof. Thus, the standard model is safe.
2. There is a calculus developed by Wess, Zumino, Stora and others [603, 664, 693,
695], which on the one hand led to a geometric understanding of BRST transfor-
mations and on the other hand turned out to be useful in anomaly calculations.
Its rigorous mathematical meaning has been clariﬁed by Kastler and Stora [359,
360], see also [85, 166, 165, 167]. Here, we only describe the basic structure
and refer to the above papers for details. Let Ω∗(P, g) be the vector space of
Ad(G)-equivariant g-valued forms on P. Consider
Ω p,a := Ωa( ˜
G , Ω p(P, g)) ∼= Ω p(P, g) ⊗Ωa ˜
G ,
and deﬁne
Ω∗∗:=

p,a
Ω p,a .
Let d and ˆδ be the differentials of Ω∗(P, g) and Ω∗˜
G , respectively. Then,
ˆδ2 = d2 = 0 ,
dˆδ −ˆδd = 0 ,
that is, (Ω∗∗, d, ˆδ) is a double complex. We have an associated total complex
(Ω∗, Δ) deﬁned as follows. Take
Ω∗:=

n
Ωn ,
Ωn :=

p+a=n
Ω p,a ,
with n called the total grading. For U ∈Ω p,a, deﬁne
sU := (−1)p ˆδU ,
Δ := d + s .
(9.3.47)
Then,
Δ2 = ds + sd = 0 ,

722
9
Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
and, clearly, both d and s are nilpotent. Moreover, endow (Ω∗, Δ) with the fol-
lowing exterior product:
[α ⊗ρ, β ⊗σ] := (−1)aq[α, β] ⊗(ρ ∧σ) ,
where α ⊗ρ ∈Ω p,a, β ⊗σ ∈Ωq,b and [α, β] denotes the standard exterior
product on Ω∗(P, g) deﬁned by the commutator. Then, (Ω∗, Δ, [·, ·]) becomes
a graded differential Lie algebra. In this formalism, the inﬁnitesimal gauge trans-
formation (6.1.20) takes the form
sω = −(dη + [ω, η]) ,
(9.3.48)
and the Maurer-Cartan equation for the Maurer-Cartan form η reads
sη = −1
2[η, η] .
(9.3.49)
Here, clearly, ω ∈Ω1,0 and η ∈Ω0,1. If one interprets s as the BRST operator,
then these equations coincide with the BRST relations. Thus, the above structure
provides a differential geometric setting for the BRST formalism.31
Note that, by the deﬁnition of the anomaly,
s μA = 0 .
This property is referred to as the Wess-Zumino consistency condition. Wess,
Zumino and Stora noticed that this condition can be used to calculate the anomaly,
up to the correct coefﬁcient, via a system of descent equations. This way, the
calculation of the anomaly becomes related to a problem in local cohomology.
In more detail, if we denote
ω := A + η ,
F := Δω + 1
2[ω, ω] ,
then, by (9.3.48) and (9.3.49), F = F. Then, by analogous arguments as in the
proof of Proposition 9.3.7,
ΔQ2n−1(ω) = P(F) ,
(9.3.50)
where P is a symmetric invariant polynomial of SU(n) and the Q2n−1 are de-
ﬁned by the right hand side of (9.3.41) with j = n −2. Now, expanding the
Chern-Simons forms Q in powers of η and decomposing (9.3.50) in the above
double complex yields the following system, referred to as the system of descent
31The question how to accommodate the anti-ghost ﬁelds in such a geometric setting is an old
problem, see e.g. [86] for a discussion. In this paper, the anti-ghosts are introduced via a certain
gauge group doubling procedure based upon the ﬁbre product bundle construction.

equations,
P(F) −dQ0,2n−1 = 0
sQ0,2n−1 + dQ1,2n−2 = 0
sQ1,2n−2 + dQ2,2n−3 = 0
. . .
sQ2n−2,1 + dQ2n−1,0 = 0
sQ2n−1,0 = 0 .
Note that, up to a normalization factor, the ﬁrst equation expresses dQ0,2n−1 in
terms of the Abelian anomaly in 2n dimensions. Solving the above system for the
chain of Chern-Simons forms yields the gauge anomaly in 2n −2 dimensions
(up to the correct normalization). It is obtained by integrating the term Q1,2n−2
over M. It is in this sense that some authors say the Abelian anomaly implies the
gauge anomaly. For the solution theory of the system of descent equations we
refer to [165] and further references therein.
3. Since the anomaly (9.3.45) satisﬁes the Wess-Zumino consistency condition, it
is sometimes referred to as the consistent anomaly. The corresponding current
obtained as the variation of the vacuum functional does not transform covariantly
under gauge transformations. However, by adding a local polynomial in the gauge
potentials, one can construct a covariant current and, then, the corresponding
anomaly transforms covariantly. One ﬁnds

.
(9.3.51)
From the point of view of perturbation theory, the consistent and the covariant
anomaly correspond to two different regularization procedures. In the ﬁrst case,
gauge invariance is lost in the regularization, in the second one it is maintained.
In particular, the Fujikawa method explained above may be applied here as well.
Within this approach, it is natural to use a gauge invariant regularization of the
Jacobian corresponding to the transformation of the path integral measure. Thus,
via this method one ﬁnds the covariant form (9.3.51) of the gauge anomaly. We
refer to Chaps.5 and 10 in [74] for a detailed discussion.
♦
(c) Global Anomalies:
The following example was analyzed by Witten [674]. Consider the case M = S4
and G = SU(2). Then, combining (9.2.3) with the exact homotopy sequence (9.2.7),
we obtain
π0(G ) = π0(Gm) = π4(SU(2)) = Z2 .
This means that G is not connected, that is, there are global gauge transformations
which cannot be continuously deformed to the unit element of G . As before, consider
a single left-handed fermion doublet coupled to an SU(2)-gauge ﬁeld. Let det(D/ A)

724
9
Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
be the corresponding fermionic determinant. Then, since such a doublet may be
viewed as being composed of two left-handed doublets,32 the fermionic determinant
of one left-handed doublet is given by

det(D/ A)
	 1
2 up to the sign. The latter must
be chosen by hand. Then, the determinant is invariant under inﬁnitesimal gauge
transformations. But, as was shown by Witten, it is odd under gauge transformations
which cannot be continuously deformed to the unit element. That is, if ρ is such a
transformation, then

det(D/ A)

2 = −

det(D/ A(ρ))

2 .
(9.3.52)
This implies that the path integral of this theory is ill-deﬁned.
Let us outline Witten's proof of Eq.(9.3.52). Recall that the Dirac operator D/ A
has a discrete spectrum consisting of real eigenvalues and to every eigenvalue λ there
corresponds an eigenvalue −λ. To have a non-vanishing determinant, we assume that
there are no zero modes. Otherwise, (9.3.52) is trivially true. We may choose the sign
of

det(D/ A)
	 1
2 e.g. by taking the product of positive eigenvalues. Now, consider the
following continuous path in C :
t →A(t) := (1 −t)A + tA(ρ) ,
t ∈[0, 1] .
It clearly interpolates between A and A(ρ). Consider the ﬂow of the eigenvalues of
D/ A(t) as t varies from 0 to 1. Clearly, the spectra for t = 0 and t = 1 are the same,
but the individual eigenvalues may rearrange on the way. It turns out that the Atiyah-
Singer Index Theorem implies such a rearrangement. The simplest one is given by a
single pair of eigenvalues (λ(t), −λ(t)) which cross at zero and change places as t
runs from 0 to 1. Thus, in this simple case (9.3.52) follows. It is also a consequence
of the Index Theorem that the number of positive eigenvalues which can become
negative is always odd. This yields (9.3.52) in the general case.
We brieﬂy explain the idea of the proof of the above statements. Let D/ (5)
A be the
Dirac operator on the 5-dimensional manifold S4 × R or, rather, on the conformal
compactiﬁcation M = S5. Let ψ be a doublet of fermions on M carrying the ten-
sor product representation of the spinor representation of O(5) and the fundamental
representation of SU(2). Explicitly, view ψ as a two-component column vector of
quaternions, let the spin group Sp(2) act by multiplication from the left and let
Sp(1) ∼= SU(2) act by diagonal multiplication from the right. This is a real repre-
sentation and, thus,33 D/ (5)
A is a self-adjoint operator on M with a discrete spectrum
consisting of real eigenvalues which are either zero or come in pairs (λ, −λ). As t
changes from 0 to 1, the number of zero-modes can only change whenever such a
pair moves to or away from zero. Thus, the number of zero modes of D/ (5)
A mod 2
is a topological invariant called the mod 2 index of D/ (5)
A . There is a corresponding
32Since the 1
2-representation of SU(2) is pseudo-real, a left-handed doublet can be mapped to a
right-handed one. Note that the argument is still formal as long as one does not regularize the
determinant.
33Keep in mind our conventions, see Deﬁnition 5.5.12.

mod 2 Index Theorem, see Part IV of [40]. Applying this theorem to the case of an
instanton-like SU(2)-gauge potential varying adiabatically from A to A(ρ) along the
above deﬁned path, one obtains that the number of zero-modes is equal to 1 mod 2.
Combining this with the study of the eigenvalue ﬂow of D/ (5)
A , see [38], one obtains
the above statement.
The above arguments immediately extend to the case of n copies of Weyl fermions.
If n is even, there is no problem, but, if n is odd, we have an anomaly. Moreover, the
above anomaly clearly extends to any symplectic group Sp(n), because π4(Sp(n)) =
Z2 for any n. On the other hand, π4(SU(n)) = 0 for n > 2 and π4(O(n)) = 0 for
n > 5, that is, for these cases no global anomaly occurs. For an extension to massive
fermions we refer to [45], for a generalization to higher SU(2) representations see
[53]. We also refer to [379] for a slightly different proof circumventing a debatable
argument in the proof of Witten and to [184] for a proof based on homotopy theory.
Nowadays, there exist various studies including other groups and theories in higher
dimensions, see e.g. [690] and further references therein.

Hamiltonian Quantum Gauge Theory on the Lattice
In the ﬁnal sections, we use some basic tools from functional analysis for which we
refer to the classical textbooks, see [82, 102, 354, 507, 529]. Our main objective is
to show how to implement the classical gauge orbit type stratiﬁcation on quantum
level. For the time being, we are able to do this in the Hamiltonian approach only.
For putting the discussion below into a broader perspective, the reader may wish to
recall Remark 9.1.1. We proceed as follows:
(a) We formulate quantum gauge ﬁeld theory on a ﬁnite lattice within the Hamil-
tonian approach. In particular, we construct the ﬁeld algebra and deﬁne the
observable algebra as the algebra of gauge-invariant operators factorized with
respect to the ideal generated by the Gauß law. Next, we comment on the classiﬁ-
cation of irreducible representations of the observable algebra in terms of global
colour charge. Finally, we comment on recent results concerning the extension
to an inﬁnite lattice.
(b) We present the concept of a costratiﬁed Hilbert space as proposed by
Huebschmann and explain how it can be used to encode the classical stratiﬁ-
cation of the gauge orbit space on quantum level. For this purpose, we use the
Hilbert space representation of the observable algebra constructed in Sect.9.5.
We illustrate the construction of the costratiﬁcation for the case of a toy model.

Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
In the subsequent two sections, we accomplish point (a). So, we consider a model of
gauge theory with gauge group G in the Hamiltonian framework on a ﬁnite regular
cubic lattice Λ in a chosen equal-time hypersurface R3 of spacetime M. For com-
pleteness, we also include fermionic matter ﬁelds although they will not be relevant
for the discussion of the gauge orbit strata. For basic notions and results concerning
lattice gauge theories, we refer to the classical papers [385, 386, 672] as well as to
the textbooks [143, 233, 458, 536, 579, 580] and further references therein.
We use the standard notation common in lattice models. For k = 0, 1, 2, 3, we
considerthesetΛk ofk-dimensionalelementswithachosenorientation.Inincreasing
order of k, such elements are called sites, links, plaquettes and cubes. In more detail:
1. Λ0 := {x = a(n1, n2, n3) ∈R3 : ni ∈Z , a ∈R+} ∩X, where X is an open
connected set in R3 and a is the lattice spacing.
2. Λ1 is a subset of the set ˜Λ1 of all oriented links between nearest neighbours,34
Λ1 ⊂˜Λ1 := {ℓ= (x, y) ∈Λ0 × Λ0 : y = x ± a ei for some i} ,
with the property that for each pair of nearest neighbours x and y it contains
either (x, y) or (y, x) but not both. Thus, the pair (Λ0, Λ1) is a directed graph.
We assume that it is connected.
3. Λ2 is a subset of the set of all oriented plaquettes,
Λ2 ⊂{p = (ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, ℓ4) ∈
 ˜Λ1	4 : pr2 ℓi = pr1 ℓi+1 , pr2 ℓ4 = pr1 ℓ1} ,
for i = 1, 2, 3. Here, prk : Λ0 × Λ0 →Λ0 is the projection onto the k-th com-
ponent.
4. Finally, oriented elementary cubes c ∈Λ3 are deﬁned in an analogous way.
It is easy to see that a change of the chosen orientations induces an isomorphism of
the ﬁeld and observable algebras to be constructed below and leaves the Hamiltonian
of the system invariant, cf. [369].
Now, given a classical gauge ﬁeld model with compact gauge group G and a
matter ﬁeld of type (μ, σ) taking values in the ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space
F = Fs ⊗Fi, its lattice approximation is obtained by restricting the matter ﬁeld ψ
to Λ0 and by approximating the gauge potential A by its parallel transporters along
the elements of Λ1, that is, the lattice approximation of the classical conﬁguration
(A, ψ) is given by the following pair of mappings
ψ : Λ0 →F ,
ˆℓA : Λ1 →G .
(9.4.1)
Thus, the classical lattice conﬁguration space is given by FΛ × CΛ, where
FΛ :=

CΛ :=

(9.4.2)
34Here, {ei} is the standard basis of R3.

PΛ :=

T∗G ∼=

(G × g∗) .
(9.4.3)
Remark 9.4.1 Since, on the lattice, continuity of the underlying space R3 is lost,
any parallel transporter on a link can be continuously deformed to the trivial one.
Thus, one can naively conclude that the possible nontrivial topological character of
a gauge ﬁeld conﬁguration is lost on the lattice. However, one can show [413] that
non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds with a sufﬁciently small action density carry a topological
charge which, in the continuum limit, reproduces the instanton number. We also refer
to [512] for a similar study in the context of a simplicial lattice. There, it is shown
that for sufﬁciently small action densities one can construct a principal bundle which
may be trivialized over the 4-dimensional dual cells of the lattice. Topologically
nontrivial conﬁgurations of monopole type may be dealt with as well, see [365].
♦
Next, one deﬁnes local lattice gauge transformations by restricting G to Λ0, that
is, a lattice gauge transformation is given by a mapping ρ : Λ0 →G and, thus, the
lattice approximation of G is given by
GΛ :=

x∈Λ0
G = GΛ0 .
(9.4.4)
By, (7.1.8) and (1.8.6), GΛ acts on FΛ × CΛ via
(ψx, ˆℓA) →(σ(ρ(x))ψx , ρ(xℓ) ˆℓA ρ(yℓ)−1) ,

forany x ∈Λ0 andℓ= (xℓ, yℓ) ∈Λ1.Thisistheclassicalkinematicalmodelwestart
with. In our presentation, we limit our attention to fermionic matter ﬁelds only. For
G = SU(3), Fs = C4 carrying the bispinor representation and Fi = C3 carrying the
fundamental representation σ of SU(3), we obtain the classical lattice approximation
of QCD.
We construct the quantum model along the lines of [271, 368, 369]. Let us start
with the fermionic matter ﬁeld. We equip FΛ with the natural pointwise inner product
⟨ψ, φ⟩:= 
x∈Λ0⟨ψ(x), φ(x)⟩F, and deﬁne the quantum matter ﬁeld algebra as the
CAR-algebra
FΛ := CAR

FΛ
	
.
(9.4.6)
That is, to every classical matter ﬁeld ψ ∈FΛ we associate a fermionic ﬁeld a(ψ) ∈
FΛ, and these quantum ﬁelds satisfy the CAR-relations,
[a(ψ), a(χ)∗]+ = ⟨ψ, χ⟩1 ,
[a(ψ), a(χ)]+ = 0 ,
for any ψ, χ ∈FΛ. Since Λ0 is ﬁnite, FΛ is a full matrix algebra, hence up to

(H f
Λ, πf). Clearly, a natural choice is provided by the fermionic Fock representation
of Jordan and Wigner [351].
In physics textbook notation, the matter ﬁeld generator at x is given by
Ψα(x) = a(fα · δx) ,
where {fα} is an orthonormal basis of (F, ⟨·, ·⟩) and δx : Λ0 →R is the characteristic
function of {x}. For a model with Dirac fermions, the spacetime component of F
is Fs = C4, standing for the bispinor degrees of freedom, and the internal part Fi
is a tensor product of some Ck, carrying a representation σ of G, with some vector
space describing ﬂavour degrees of freedom. Neglecting the latter, the matter ﬁeld
generator at x ∈Λ0 is given by
Ψμi(x) = a((εμ ⊗ei) · δx) ,
(9.4.7)
where {εμ} and {ei} are orthonormal bases in C4 and Ck, respectively. We note that
FΛ is generated as a C*-algebra by the set
{Ψμi(x) | μ = 1, . . . , 4, i = 1, . . . , k, x ∈Λ0}.
Next, to quantize the classical gauge connections, we generalize the Schrödinger
representation for a particle on the real line acting on the Hilbert space L2(R) as
follows: for any ϕ ∈L2(G), we deﬁne the bounded operators
(Ugϕ)(h) := ϕ(g−1h) ,

T f ϕ)(h) := f (h)ϕ(h) ,
(9.4.8)
where g, h ∈G and f ∈L∞(G). Here, U is the left regular unitary representation of
G and T is the natural representation of L∞(G) given by left multiplication. Clearly,
T and U represent the position and momentum operator analogues, respectively. The
pair π0 := (U, T ) will be referred to as the generalized Schrödinger representation.
Below, it will be interpreted in the language of C∗-algebras. Note that π0 is irreducible
in the sense that the commutant of UG ∪TL∞(G) consists of the scalars. Also note that
there is a natural ground state unit vector ϕ0 ∈L2(G) given by the constant function
ϕ0(h) = 1 for all h ∈G.35 Then, Ugϕ0 = ϕ0, and, by irreducibility, ϕ0 is cyclic with
respect to the *-algebra generated by UG ∪TL∞(G). By construction, π0 fulﬁls the
intertwining relation
Ug ◦T f ◦U ∗
g = Tλg( f ) ,
(9.4.9)
where
λ : G →Aut(C(G)) ,
λg( f )(h) := f (g−1h) ,
(9.4.10)
for any g, h ∈G. This relation implies generalized commutation relations as follows.
By (9.4.3), identiﬁying g∗∼= g, the classical canonically conjugate momenta, also

referred to as the colour electric ﬁelds, are given by elements of g. For X ∈g, we
deﬁne the associated momentum operator by
PX : C∞(G) →C∞(G) ,
PXϕ := i d

U(et X)ϕ .
(9.4.11)
Then, for any f, ϕ ∈C∞(G) and X ∈g,

Denoting the right invariant vector ﬁeld on G by X R, we obtain

PX, T f

= iTX R( f ) .
(9.4.12)
For G = R, this yields the standard Heisenberg commutation relations. Since PX =
dU(X), we obtain a representation of the Lie algebra g on L2(G) which obviously
fulﬁls PXϕ0 = 0.
Remark 9.4.2 (Generators) As above, let σ be a faithful representation of G on Ck,
e.g. the fundamental representation of SU(3) on C3 for QCD. Choose an orthonormal
basis {ei}, i = 1, . . . k, of Ck and deﬁne the collection of functions σi j ∈C(G) by
σi j(g) := ⟨ei, σ(g)e j⟩.
(9.4.13)
Since the σi j are matrix elements of elements of G in the representation σ, they fulﬁl
obvious relations reﬂecting the structure of G, see [368, 369] for details. Moreover,
by (9.4.10),
λg(σi j)(h) =

m
⟨ei, σ(g−1)em⟩σmj(h) .
(9.4.14)
Since σ is faithful, the algebra generated by the functions σi j with respect to point-
wise multiplication separates the points in G, hence by the Weierstrass Theorem,
it is a dense subalgebra of C(G). Thus, the C*-algebra generated by the operators
{Tσi j | i, j = 1, . . . , k} is TC(G), that is, the algebra of multiplication operators by
continuous functions on G.
Next, choose an orthonormal basis {ta} of g and consider the corresponding basis
{σ ′
im(ta)} in End(Ck). Then, the operators Ea := Pta span all of Pg and, thus, the
unitary group they generate is all of UG ⊂M(C∗(G)), where M(C∗(G)) denotes
the multiplier algebra of C∗(G). From Example 3 in Sect 3 of [679] and [475], we
also see that they generate C∗(G) in the sense of Woronowicz. Associated with the
generators Ea, we have the following set of End(Ck)-valued generators:
Ei j :=

tum level. For the fermionic part we deﬁne

(9.4.22)
As already noted, π f is equivalent to the fermionic Fock representation. Thus, it is
covariant with respect to αf, that is, there is a (continuous) unitary representation
V f : GΛ →U (H f
Λ) such that

Field Algebra and Observable Algebra
In this section, we construct the ﬁeld algebra and the observable algebra of the model
presented in the previous section. For functional analytic basics used below we refer
to [82, 102, 507].
Note that the fermionic ﬁeld algebra FΛ has already been identiﬁed as the C∗-
algebra of canonical anti-commutation relations. Thus, it remains to construct a C∗-
algebra for the bosonic part. By (9.4.9), the generalized Schrödinger representation
π0 = (U, T ) is a covariant representation of the C∗-dynamical system (C(G), G, λ)
with λ : G →Aut

C(G)
	
deﬁned by (9.4.10). Associated with this C∗-dynamical
system, there is a natural crossed product C∗-algebra37 C(G) ⋊λ G. Its representa-
tions are exactly the covariant representations of the C∗-dynamical system deﬁned
by λ. It is well known that C(G) ⋊λ G is isomorphic to the algebra of compact
operators on L2(G),
C(G) ⋊λ G ∼= K

L2(G)
	
,
(9.5.1)
see [531] and Theorem II.10.4.3 in [82]. In fact,
π0

C(G) ⋊λ G
	
= K

L2(G)
	
.
Since K

L2(G)
	
has a unique irreducible representation up to unitary equivalence,
it follows that π0 is the unique irreducible covariant representation of (C(G), G, λ)
(up to equivalence). Moreover, as ϕ0 is cyclic for K

L2(G)
	
, π0 is unitarily equivalent
to the GNS-representation of the vector state ω0 given by ω0(A) := (ϕ0, π0(A)ϕ0)
for A ∈C(G) ⋊λ G.
Remark 9.5.1
1. For the convenience of the reader, let us give the deﬁnition of C(G) ⋊λ G. Take
L1(G, C(G)), deﬁned as the ∗-algebra of C(G)-valued L1-functions on G, en-
dowed with multiplication given by the twisted convolution
(z × w)(g′) :=

G
z(g)λg(w(g−1g′))dg ,
with the involution induced from the ∗-structure of C(G),
z∗(g) = λg(z(g−1)∗) ,
37Also referred to as the generalized Weyl algebra.

9.5 Field Algebra and Observable Algebra
733
and with the standard L1-norm. Consider all its non-degenerate Hilbert space
representations. Then, C(G) ⋊λ G is deﬁned as the completion of the algebra
L1(G, C(G)) in the sup-norm taken over all these representations. This way we
obtain a C∗-algebra without unit. This algebra can be viewed as a skew tensor
product of C(G) with the group algebra C∗(G) in the following sense: For each
u ∈C(G) and f ∈L1(G) denote by u ⊗f the element of L1(G, C(G)) given
by (u ⊗f )(g) := u f (g) . Then, the linear span of such elements is dense in
L1(G, C(G)) . It is easily seen that
f →1 ⊗f
(9.5.2)
is an isomorphism onto its image, which allows for identifying C∗(G) with the
corresponding subalgebra:
C∗(G) ⊂C(G) ⋊λ G .
(9.5.3)
As already noted, C∗(G) is a C∗-algebra generated by unbounded elements in the
sense of Woronowicz. Consequently, C(G) ⋊λ G is of this type, too. It is gener-
ated by elements (X, f ) fulﬁlling the canonical commutation relations (9.4.12).
We stress that both the (unbounded) generators X and the (bounded) generators f
do not belong to the algebra, but are only afﬁliated in the C∗-sense. Moreover, note
that-contrary to (9.5.2)-the mapping u →u ⊗1 does not preserve the algebraic
structure of C(G) and, whence, cannot be used to imbed C(G) into C(G) ⋊λ G.
Hence, C(G) is not a subalgebra of C(G) ⋊λ G, but belongs to its multiplier
algebra M(C(G) ⋊λ G). Note that, clearly, the operators Ug are not compact but
belong to the multiplier algebra as well. This is not a problem, because a state or
representation on C(G) ⋊λ G has a unique extension to its multiplier algebra, so
will be fully determined on these elements. If one chose C∗(UG ∪TL∞(G)) as the
ﬁeld algebra instead of C(G) ⋊λ G, then this would contain many inappropriate
representations, e.g. covariant representations for λ : G →Aut

C(G)
	
where
the implementing unitaries are discontinuous with respect to G.
2. The algebraic counterpart of C(G) ⋊λ G is the following crossed product of Hopf
algebras38:
C∞(G) ⋊λ U(g) ,
see [368] for details. Here, U(g) denotes the enveloping algebra of g.
♦
We combine the above building blocks into the ﬁeld algebra
AΛ := FΛ ⊗BΛ
(9.5.4)
with the bosonic part deﬁned by
38This is an example of a Heisenberg double of Hopf algebras, c.f. [358].

BΛ :=


C(G) ⋊λ G
	
.
(9.5.5)
This algebra is well deﬁned as Λ1 is ﬁnite, and the cross-norms are unique as all
algebras involved are nuclear. Moreover, using (9.5.1), we obtain
BΛ ∼=

ℓ∈Λ1
K(L2(G)) .
(9.5.6)
Since FΛ is a full matrix algebra, AΛ is simple and, thus,
AΛ ∼= K(L ) ,
(9.5.7)
where L is some generic inﬁnite-dimensional separable Hilbert space. This shows
that, for a ﬁnite lattice, there will be only one irreducible representation, up to unitary
equivalence.39 Moreover, since AΛ is simple, all representations are faithful. This
implies the following.
Proposition 9.5.2 The ﬁeld algebra AΛ is faithfully and irreducibly represented by

HΛ, π
	
, that is,
π(AΛ) = K

HΛ
	
.
(9.5.8)
Note that π

AΛ
	
contains in its multiplier algebra the operators ˆT (ℓ)
σi j(ℓ) and ˆU (ℓ)
g
for
all ℓ∈Λ1.
Finally, we deﬁne the (product) action of the gauge group GΛ on AΛ = FΛ ⊗BΛ,
α : GΛ →Aut

AΛ
	
,
α := αf ⊗αb .
(9.5.9)
Recall that the action αf : GΛ →Aut

FΛ
	
has already been deﬁned, see (9.4.22). To
deﬁne the action αb : GΛ →Aut

BΛ
	
, recall that in the representation π it is given
by ρ →Ad(Vρ), cf. (9.4.25) and (9.4.26). This action clearly preserves π

AΛ
	
=
K(HΛ) and, since ρ →Vρ is strongly operator continuous, it deﬁnes a strongly
continuous action α of GΛ on π

AΛ
	
and, thus, on AΛ, By construction, (π, V ) is a
covariant representation for the C*-dynamical system given by α. As GΛ is locally
compact,wecanconstructthecrossedproductAΛ ⋊α GΛ whoserepresentationspace
is built from all covariant representations of α : GΛ →Aut

AΛ
	
.
Let us describe the action αb in detail. First, consider one building block
C(G) ⋊λ G of BΛ corresponding to a link (x, y) ∈Λ1. In view of (9.4.25) and
(9.4.26) we deﬁne
τ : GΛ →Aut(C(G)) ,
(τρu)(g) := u(ρ(x)−1gρ(y)) ,
39This may be viewed as a generalization of the classical von Neumann uniqueness theorem for
irreducible representations of the canonical commutation relations on R.

9.5 Field Algebra and Observable Algebra
735
and
β : GΛ →Aut(L1(G)) ,
(βρ f )(g) := f (ρ(x)−1gρ(x)) .
By point 1 of Remark 9.5.1, C(G) ⋊λ G is the closure of the space spanned by
L1(G) · C(G). Thus, the pair (τ, β) induces a representation on C(G) ⋊λ G by
θρ( f · u) := βρ( f ) · τρ(u) .
(9.5.10)
Now, αb is deﬁned as the tensor product representation of the representations θ(ℓ)
over all ℓ∈Λ1, with every θ(ℓ) deﬁned by (9.5.10).
Given the action α, we can derive the lattice counterpart of the local Gauß law.
In abstract terms, a Gauß law generator is, by deﬁnition, a nonzero element in the
range of the derived action
dα : gΛ →Der

A∞
Λ
	
,
where gΛ is the Lie algebra of GΛ and A∞
Λ denotes the subalgebra of smooth elements
with respect to the action. By (9.5.9),
dα(v) = dαf(v) ⊗1 + 1 ⊗dαb(v) ,
for any v ∈gΛ. To calculate dα explicitly, note that gΛ is spanned by elements of
the form v = X · δx for X ∈g and x ∈Λ0. Using this, we calculate
dαf(X · δx)(a(ψ)) = d
dt ↾0
a(exp(t X · δx)ψ) = a(δx · Xψ) .
(9.5.11)
Next, by (9.5.10), dθ(v) = dβ(v) + dτ(v). For u ∈C∞(G), we calculate
dτ(X · δx)(u)(g) = d

dβ(X · δx)( f )(g) = d
dt ↾0
f

e−t Xget X

(9.5.13)
Now, note that αb(X · δx) affects only those links which contain x, that is, the nearest
neighbours (x, y±
k ) := (x, x ± aek), with k = 1, 2, 3, of x,
dαb(X · δx) =

(x,y±
k )
dθ(x,y±
k )(X · δx) .
To summarize, we have

dα(X · δx) = dαf(X · δx) ⊗1 + 1 ⊗

(x,y±

with dαb, dτ (x,y±
k ) and dβ(x,y±
k ) given by (9.5.11), (9.5.12) and (9.5.13), respectively.
Correspondingly, we have a local Gauß law at every lattice point x ∈Λ0 given by
dα(X · δx) = 0 ,
(9.5.15)
for every X ∈g.
Remark 9.5.3 (Local Gauß Law) Recall that, in the representation (HΛ, π), the
gauge group GΛ acts via the unitary representation V given by (9.4.28). Using the
description of the ﬁeld algebra in terms of generators provided by (9.4.7) and Remark
9.4.2, in the representation V the local Gauß law reads as follows (Exercise 9.5.1):

(x,y±
k )
Ei j(x, y±
k ) = qi j(x) .
(9.5.16)
Here, qi j is the local matter charge density. For G = SU(3), it reads
qi j(x) = Ψ ∗
i (x)Ψ j(x) −1
3δi jΨ ∗
l (x)Ψl(x) .
(9.5.17)
♦
Now, we can deﬁne the observable algebra of the system.40
Deﬁnition 9.5.4 (Observable algebra) The observable algebra of the lattice gauge
theory is deﬁned by
OΛ := AGΛ/{IΛ ∩AGΛ} ,
where AGΛ ⊂AΛ is the subalgebra of GΛ-invariant elements of AΛ and IΛ ⊂AΛ is
the ideal41 generated by gΛ.
Recall that, under the representation π, the ﬁeld algebra AΛ gets identiﬁed with
the algebra K(HΛ) of compact operators on HΛ, cf. Proposition 9.5.2. Under this
identiﬁcation, we have a unitary representation V of GΛ on HΛ and the subalgebra
AGΛ can be viewed as the commutant (GΛ)′ of this representation in K(HΛ).
Consider the closed subspace H GΛ ⊂HΛ consisting of GΛ-invariant vectors,
H GΛ := {Φ ∈HΛ | Vρ(Φ) = Φ for all ρ ∈GΛ} .
(9.5.18)
40In [271], we have shown that the deﬁnition below coincides with the algebra obtained by the
T -procedure of Grundling and Hurst, see [268, 269, 270].
41Let Cbe the ideal in AΛ generated by the local Gauß laws (9.5.16). Then, IΛ is the ideal generated
by C in C∗(AGΛ ∪C), see [271] for further details.

Theorem 9.5.5 The observable algebra OΛ is isomorphic to the algebra of compact
operators on H GΛ,
OΛ ∼= K

H GΛ	
.
(9.5.19)
Proof Consider the direct sum decomposition
HΛ = H GΛ ⊕

H GΛ	⊥,
(9.5.20)
with

H GΛ	⊥denoting the orthogonal complement of H GΛ. Since H GΛ is invariant
under GΛ, by unitarity of V , the complement

H GΛ	⊥is invariant, too. Hence, with
respect to the decomposition (9.5.20), any element of GΛ has the block-diagonal
form
1 0
0 B

with some unitary operator B on

H GΛ	⊥. First, we show
(GΛ)′ =
C 0


∈K(HΛ) : [B, D] = 0 for all
1 0



.
(9.5.21)
Indeed, an operator
C E
F D

belongs to (GΛ)′ iff for any
1 0
0 B

∈GΛ it satisﬁes
E = E B ,
BF = F ,
BD = DB .
(9.5.22)
This implies that for every φ ∈H GΛ we have Fφ = BFφ and hence Fφ ∈H GΛ.
On the other hand, Fφ ∈

H GΛ	⊥, because F maps H GΛ to

H GΛ	⊥. It follows
that Fφ = 0 and hence F = 0. By analogy, E = 0. This proves (9.5.21).
Now, we decompose
C 0

.
Since the restriction of a compact operator to a closed subspace is compact, we have
C ∈K(H GΛ). Moreover,

∈IΛ . This yields the direct sum decomposition
(GΛ)′ = K

and hence the assertion.

We close this section by three remarks. For details we refer to [271, 272, 368,
369]. In sharp contrast to the Abelian case,42 the local Gauß laws (9.5.16) are neither
built from gauge invariant operators nor are they linear.43 Thus, the question arises
42See [373-375]. In these papers, the observable algebra for Lattice QED and Lattice Scalar QED
is analyzed in detail.
43The apparent linearity with respect to the colour electric ﬁelds Ei j on the left hand side is due to
the fact that, in this formula, every Ei j is 'parallelly transported' to the point x. If we would like to

whether one can extract from Eq.(9.5.16) a gauge invariant and linear relation for
each lattice point. These relations could then be summed up over all lattice points to
produce a gauge invariant global Gauß law. This problem was solved in [368].
Remark 9.5.6 (Global colour charge) For concreteness, we limit our attention to the
case of QCD, that is, G = SU(3). Recall that, for every ℓ∈Λ1, the colour electric
ﬁelds Ei j(ℓ) generate a unitary representation of G. Using the CAR-relations for the
fermionic generators Ψi(x), one easily shows (Exercise 9.5.2) that, for every x ∈Λ0,
the local charge density operators qi j(x) generate a unitary representation of G, too.
By construction,
[Ei j(ℓ), Ekl(ℓ′)] = 0 ,
[qi j(x), qkl(x′)] = 0 ,
for ℓ̸= ℓ′ and x ̸= x′. Thus, let {Fa} be a collection of commuting unitary repre-
sentations of G on a Hilbert space H and let {fa} be the corresponding collection
of derived representations of the Lie algebra g. If f1 and f2 belong to that collection,
then so does f1 + f2. Such a collection of operators is an operator domain in the
sense of Woronowicz, see [678]. We deﬁne an operator function on this domain, that
is, a mapping f →ϕ(f) satisfying ϕ(UfU −1) = Uϕ(f)U −1 for any isometry U, as
follows: for a given representation f, consider the corresponding representation F
of G. Its restriction to the center Z of G acts as a multiple of the identity on each
irreducible subspace Hα of F,
F(z)↾Hα = χα
F(z) · 1Hα ,
z ∈Z .
Obviously, χα
F is a character on Z and, therefore, (χα
F(z))3 = 1. We identify the
group of characters on Z = {ζ · 13 | ζ 3 = 1, ζ ∈C} with the additive group Z3 ∼=
{−1, 0, 1} by assigning to any character χα
F a number k(α) ∈{−1, 0, 1} fulﬁlling
χα
F(ζ · 13) = ζ k(α) .
We deﬁne
f →ϕ(f) :=

α
ϕα(f) 1Hα ,
(9.5.23)
with ϕα(f) given by
ζ ϕα(f) = χα
F( ζ · 13) .
(9.5.24)
Since χα
F are characters, we have
ϕ(f1 + f2) = ϕ(f1) + ϕ(f2) .
(9.5.25)
Now, using the equivalence of each irreducible representation α of G with highest
weight (m(α), n(α)) with the tensor representation in the space Tm(α)n(α)(C3) of
assign them to, say, the middle of the link they live on we would have to apply the parallel transport
operator. This would produce the lattice approximation of the covariant divergence on that link.

739
m(α)-contravariant,n(α)-covariant,completelysymmetricandtracelesstensorsover
C3, we get
χα
F(z) = ζ ϕα(f) = ζ m(α)−n(α) ,
for z = ζ · 13 ∈Z. Thus, we have
ϕα(f) = (m(α) −n(α)) mod 3 ,
(9.5.26)
for every irreducible highest weight representation (m(α), n(α)). In [368] we have
given an explicit construction of ϕ(f) in terms of the Casimir operators of f.
Applying ϕ to the local Gauß law (9.5.16) and using the additivity property
(9.5.25), we obtain a gauge invariant equation for operators with eigenvalues in
Z3:

(x,y±
k )
ϕ

E(x, y±
k )
	
= ϕ(q(x)) ,
(9.5.27)
valid at every lattice site x. Moreover, it is easy to check that
ϕ(E(x, y)) + ϕ(E(y, x)) = 0 ,
(9.5.28)
for every link (x, y). The quantity on the right hand side of (9.5.27) is the (gauge
invariant) local colour charge density carried by the quark ﬁeld. By deﬁnition, the
sum of local colour charges over all lattice sites is referred to as the global colour
charge44 carried by the matter ﬁeld:
tΛ :=

x∈Λ0
ϕ(q(x)) .
(9.5.29)
Now, let us extend the picture by assigning to each point of the boundary ∂Λ of Λ
exactly one external link and let us assume that gluons and colour electric ﬁelds may
live on these links. Let us take the sum of equations(9.5.27) over all lattice sites x ∈
Λ0. Then, by (9.5.28), all terms on the left hand side cancel, except for contributions
coming from the boundary. Thus, the global Gauß law takes the following form:
Φ∂Λ = tΛ ,

where

is the global Z3-valued boundary ﬂux of the colour electric ﬁeld. In [369] we have
proved that the inequivalent irreducible representations of the observable algebra45
are labelled by the global colour charge. We also refer to [348] for an alternative
proof.

Stone's Theorem, this operator generates a one-parameter group of time evolution
on H GΛ.

46The naive Hamiltonian given by (9.5.31) leads to the well known fermion doubling problem, that
is, the lattice fermion propagator has 16 poles (in four dimensions). Starting with an improvement
proposed by Wilson [673], various concepts to cure this problem have been developed, see the
textbook literature cited above. In [488] it was shown that the doubling problem can only be
avoided by giving up one of a number of plausible requirements, including chiral invariance in the
zero mass case, see [216] for a rigorous proof. This observation led to an intensive study of the
lattice approximation of the Dirac operator. We refer to [414-416] and the textbooks [233, 536].

sentation of the CAR-algebra of the full lattice. The bosonic part is an inﬁnite tensor
product of the generalized Schrödinger representations (in the sense of von Neu-
mann) for the individual links with respect to a natural reference vector, and a ﬁxed
enumeration of the links. On that Hilbert space, all the local ﬁeld algebras, that is, the
ﬁeld algebras associated with ﬁnite sublattices, are naturally represented. Then, on
a suitable C∗-algebra (containing all the local algebras) acting on that Hilbert space,
the existence of a one-parameter group generated by the (inﬁnite lattice version of)
the Hamiltonian (9.5.31) is proven. This one-parameter group is the pointwise norm
limit of the local time evolutions with respect to a sequence of ﬁnite sublattices,
exhausting the full lattice. Moreover, the existence of regular gauge invariant ground
states is shown but, for the time being, there is no uniqueness proof.

In this section, we limit our attention to pure gauge theory on a ﬁnite lattice. In this
situation, the classical conﬁguration space is CΛ = GΛ1, acted upon by the group
of local gauge transformations GΛ = GΛ0 via (9.4.5). Correspondingly, the classical
phase space is given by the associated Hamiltonian Lie group action. According to
Corollary 10.1.21 of Part I, the latter is given by the following data:
1. the symplectic manifold T∗CΛ,
2. the action of GΛ by the induced point transformations,
3. the natural momentum mapping JΛ : T∗CΛ →LGΛ deﬁned by evaluating the
elements of T∗CΛ on the Killing vector ﬁelds of the action of GΛ on CΛ.
Since the Killing vector ﬁelds correspond to'unphysical' directions in CΛ, they
should not be recognized by 'physical' momenta. Hence, the latter should be an-
nihilated by JΛ. This condition corresponds to the local Gauß law in the continuum
theory. As a consequence, the classical reduced phase space of the model is obtained
by symplectic reduction at zero level,47

This is a stratiﬁed symplectic space, where the strata are given by the orbit type
components, that is, the connected components of the orbit type subsets.
It is convenient to carry out the reduction (9.6.1) in two stages: ﬁrst with respect
to the pointed gauge group
Gx0 = {g ∈G : g(x0) = 1}
forsomechosensite x0 ∈Λ0,andthenwithrespecttotheresidualactionofGΛ/Gx0 ∼=
G. The ﬁrst stage is obtained by zero level reduction of the Hamiltonian Lie group
action associated with the action of Gx0 on CΛ. Since the latter action is free and
since 0 is a regular value of JΛ, we are in the realm of regular zero level reduction.
Consequently,thesymplecticquotientisgivenbythecotangentbundleofthequotient
manifold CΛ/Gx0. Thus, the second stage boils down to zero level reduction of the
Hamiltonian Lie group action associated with the residual action of GΛ/Gx0 ∼= G on
CΛ/Gx0. Since the ﬁrst stage of the reduction is regular, it is at the second stage where
a stratiﬁcation may arise. Consequently, for studying the quantum signiﬁcance of the
stratiﬁcation, it sufﬁces to restrict attention to that stage.
Let us give a more convenient description of the quotient manifold CΛ/Gx0 in
terms of a tree gauge. For that purpose, choose a maximal lattice tree T , that is, a
simply connected subset T ⊂Λ1 such that every site belongs to some link in T .
One can check the following (Exercise 9.6.1).
1. For every site x there exists a unique path in T from x to the site x0 chosen in the
deﬁnition of Gx0. Given a lattice gauge potential { ˆℓA}, one can use these unique
paths to construct a gauge transformation ρ such that
ˆℓ(ρ)
A = 1 for all ℓ∈T .
(9.6.2)
2. Two lattice gauge potentials satisfying (9.6.2) are conjugate under GΛ iff they
differ by a constant gauge transformation. In particular, no two such elements are
conjugate under Gx0.
Via a numbering ℓ1, . . . , ℓN of the links in Λ1\T , every element (g1, . . . , gN) ∈G N
deﬁnes a mapping Λ1 →G by assigning the members gi to the corresponding off-
tree links ℓi and 1 to all links in T . This way, we obtain an embedding G N →CΛ
whose image coincides with the subset deﬁned by (9.6.2). Thus, by composing
this embedding with the natural projection to classes CΛ →CΛ/Gx0, we obtain a
diffeomorphism G N ∼= CΛ/Gx0 whichisequivariantwithrespecttotheactionof G on
G N by diagonal inner automorphisms on G N and the residual action of GΛ/Gx0 ∼= G
on CΛ/Gx0.
As a result, the second stage of the reduction (9.6.1) is equivalent to zero level
symplectic reduction of the Hamiltonian Lie group action associated with the action
of G on G N by diagonal inner automorphisms,
ψg(g1, . . . , gN) = (gg1g−1, . . . , ggN g−1) .

(9.6.3)
As noted before, the corresponding reduced phase space
P = J −1(0)/G
is a stratiﬁed symplectic space with the strata given by the orbit type components
of P. Thus, denoting the set of orbit type components by T, we have a disjoint
decomposition
P =

τ∈T
Pτ
(9.6.4)
satisfying the frontier condition, that is, for all τ, τ ′ ∈T,
Pτ ∩Pτ ′ ̸= ∅implies Pτ ⊂Pτ ′ .
The partial ordering of orbit types deﬁned in Sect.8.2 extends to a partial ordering
of T in an obvious way. Since the closures of distinct connected components of an
orbit type subset do not intersect,
Pτ ⊂Pτ ′
iff τ ≤τ ′ .
(9.6.5)
Clearly, the orbit types appearing in P form a subset of the set of orbit types of the
lifted action Ψ on T∗G N. By [509], the latter coincides with the set of orbit types of
the original action on the base space G N. Thus, it is enough to know the orbit types
of the latter. As an illustration, let us give an example [124].
Example 9.6.1 (Orbit types of the diagonal action of G on G N for G = SU(3)) Let
Z denote the center of G. For N = 1, the action has three orbit types. Let g ∈G.
1. If g has three distinct eigenvalues, Gg ∼= U(1)2 and g lies in the generic stratum.
2. If g has two distinct eigenvalues, Gg ∼= U(2).
3. If g has a single eigenvalue, it belongs to Z and Gg = SU(3).
For N ≥2, the action has ﬁve orbit types. Let g := (g1, . . . , gN) ∈G N.

1. If the gi have no common eigenspace, Gg = Z and g lies in the generic stratum.
2. If the gi have exactly one common 1-dimensional eigenspace, Gg ∼= U(1).
3. If the gi have three common 1-dimensional eigenspaces, Gg ∼= U(1) × U(1).
4. If the gi have a 2-dimensional common eigenspace, Gg ∼= U(2).
5. Otherwise, all gi belong to Z and Gg = SU(3).

There are two strategies for implementing the stratiﬁed structure on quantum level.
1. Quantization after reduction: perform the singular symplectic reduction at zero
level and develop a quantum theory on the stratiﬁed space so obtained.
2. Reduction after quantization: start with the quantum theory as described in the
previous section and develop a reduction procedure on quantum level.
A closer look at (9.6.3) shows that it is hard to perform the reduction to the zero
level set on the classical level explicitly. For the study of toy models, including the
investigation of the topological structure of the lattice gauge orbit space, we refer to
[125, 202].
Below, we will follow the second strategy. To implement the stratiﬁed structure
on quantum level, we will use the concept of costratiﬁed Hilbert space developed by
Huebschmann [325, 326]. We start with the Hilbert space representation H GΛ of
the observable algebra constructed in Sect.9.4, cf. formula (9.5.18). Let
HN = L2(G)⊗N = L2(G N)
and
H := H G
N = {ϕ ∈HN : ψ∗
gϕ = ϕ for all g ∈G} .
We have a natural isomorphism H GΛ ∼= H . Thus, we may take H as the Hilbert
space of the quantum system.
Deﬁnition 9.6.2 A costratiﬁcation of H associated with the stratiﬁcation (9.6.4)
is an assignment of a closed subspace Hτ ⊂H to every τ ∈T such that τ ≤τ ′
implies Hτ ⊂Hτ ′.
Our deﬁnition is adapted to the model under consideration. For the general concept,
see [325]. Now, the idea is that Hτ should consist of wave functions localized at Pτ.
To make this precise, we must relate the elements of H to functions on P. This will
be accomplished in two steps. First, we use the Segal-Bargmann transformation for
compact Lie groups developed by Hall [278] to obtain an isomorphism of H with
the Hilbert space
H C := H L2
(GC)N	G
of G-invariant holomorphic functions which are square integrable with respect to a
certain measure given below. Here, GC is the complexiﬁcation of G. The beneﬁt of
this will be that the elements of H C are true functions on (GC)N and not just classes
[282]. In a second step, we will relate these elements to functions on P.

inner product on g. Since ρt is invariant under inner automorphisms, according to
the Peter-Weyl Theorem, it can be expanded with respect to the characters χπ of the
irreducible representations π of G. The expansion coefﬁcients are given by
ρt(g) =

π∈ˆG
dim Vπ e−ζπ t/2 χπ(g) ,
g ∈G ,
(9.6.6)
where ζπ is the eigenvalue of the second Casimir operator of the representation
π [600, p. 38]. Since every irreducible representation of G extends uniquely to a
holomorphic representation of GC, the characters χπ may be analytically continued.
Thus, replacing each χπ in (9.6.6) by its analytic continuation, we obtain a candidate
for the analytic continuation of ρt. It can be shown that the corresponding series is
convergent and holomorphic, indeed. Let us denote the analytic continuation of ρt
so obtained by the same symbol. Now, the Segal-Bargmann transformation of G is
deﬁned by
Ct : L2(G) →Hol(GC) ,
Ct(ϕ)(g) :=

G
ρt(g′−1g)ϕ(g′)dg′ ,
(9.6.7)
where dg′ denotes the Haar measure on G and Hol(GC) is the space of holomorphic
functions on GC. For the proof of the following theorem, see [278].
Theorem 9.6.3 (Hall) For every t > 0, there exists a measure νt on GC such that
Ct is a unitary mapping from L2(G, dg) onto H L2(GC, νt). This measure is given
by
νt(g) =

μt(g′g)dg′ ,
(9.6.8)
where μt is the heat kernel of the Laplace operator on GC.49

product obtained by identifying the real vector space gC with the orthogonal direct sum g⊕g.

and δ denotes half the sum of positive roots of g. The Segal-Bargmann transformation
takes a very simple explicit form when applied to representative functions. Recall
that a representative function on G is a linear combination of functions of the form
G →C ,
g →⟨ξ, π(g)v⟩,
where π is some irreducible representation of G on a complex vector space V and
v ∈V , ξ ∈V ∗. The characters χπ are examples of that type with the additional
property of being G-invariant. Since every irreducible complex representation of
G extends uniquely to a holomorphic representation of GC, every representative
function ϕ has an analytic continuation ϕC to GC.
Proposition 9.6.4 (Huebschmann) Let ϕ be a representative function on G associ-
ated with the irreducible representation of highest weight λ. Then,
Ct(ϕ) =
ϕC

ct,λ = (tπ)dim(G)/2et|λ+δ|2 .
Proof See Theorem 6.5 in [327].

In terms of the highest weight λ, the eigenvalue ζπ of the second Casimir operator
of the irreducible representation π is given by
ζπ ≡ζλ = |δ|2 −|λ + δ|2 ,
(9.6.12)
see for example [294, Sect. V.1].
Remark 9.6.5 (Kähler Structure) Let J : TGC →TGC be the natural complex struc-
ture on the manifold GC deﬁned by multiplication with the imaginary unit i. Under
the identiﬁcation of the Lie algebra of GC with g ⊕g, it is given by
J(A, B) = (−B, A) ,
A, B ∈g .
Via the isomorphism Φ, we can transport J to a complex structure on T∗G,
JT∗G := (Φ∗)−1 ◦J ◦Φ∗.
One easily calculates (Exercise 9.6.2)

Combining this with the natural symplectic structure ω on T∗G, cf. Example 8.3.4 in

9.6.2) that the canonical 1-form θ of T∗G reads

Thus, κ is a potential of the Kähler structure. It can be shown that the Hilbert space
H L2(GC, νt) may also be obtained via half-form Kähler quantization with respect
to this Kähler structure [281].
♦
Remark 9.6.6 (Holomorphic Peter-Weyl Theorem) In [327], Huebschmann has
proved a Peter-Weyl Theorem for the Hilbert space H L2(GC). He has called this
the Holomorphic Peter-Weyl Theorem. Combining it with the ordinary Peter-Weyl
Theorem for L2(G) and computing the norms of the analytic continuations of repre-
sentative functions, one ﬁnds that the assignment ϕ →ϕC/√ct,λ uniquely extends
to a unitary isomorphism L2(G) →H L2(GC). In view of Proposition 9.6.4, this
provides an alternative proof of Theorem 9.6.3. Conversely, the Holomorphic Peter-
Weyl Theorem is a consequence of Theorem 9.6.3 and Proposition 9.6.4.
♦
By applying the Segal-Bargmann transformation to every copy of G, we obtain a
unitary isomorphism
Ct : HN →H L2
(GC)N	
.
Using bi-invariance of the Haar measure on G and the fact that the irreducible char-
acters χπ are invariant under inner automorphisms of G, one can check that Ct is
equivariant with respect to the actions of G on HN and H L2
(GC)N	
induced by
diagonal conjugation on G N and (GC)N, respectively. Hence, Ct restricts to a unitary
isomorphism of the subspaces of invariants, denoted by the same letter,
Ct : H →H C .
As a result, via the isomorphisms Ct, wave functions are represented by holomor-
phic functions on (GC)N ∼= T∗G N. As already noted, the elements of H C are true

748
9
Elements of Quantum Gauge Theory
functions on (GC)N and not just classes. This completes the ﬁrst step in the process
of relating the elements of H with functions on P.
In the second step, we must now clarify how to interpret elements of H C as
functions on P. In the case N = 1, we observe that J (g, Y) = 0 implies that,
up to conjugacy, (g, Y) may be chosen from T × t, where T ⊂G is a maximal toral
subgroup and t ⊂g the corresponding Lie subalgebra. Hence,
P ∼= (T × t)W ∼= TC/W ,
where W = NG(T )/T is the Weyl group. On the other hand, restriction to TC deﬁnes
a unitary isomorphism
H C = H L2(GC)G ∼= H L2(TC)W
with the measure on T being obtained from (9.6.10) by integration over the con-
jugation orbits in GC, thus yielding an analogue of Weyl's integration formula for
H L2(GC)G.
In the case N > 1, the argument is more involved. First, we construct a quotient
of G N
C on which the elements of H C deﬁne functions. Consider the action of GC on
(GC)N by diagonal conjugation. For a ∈G N
C, let GC · a denote the corresponding
orbit. Since GC is not compact, GC · a need not be closed. If a holomorphic func-
tion on (GC)N is invariant under the action of G by diagonal conjugation, then it is
invariant under the action of GC by diagonal conjugation, i.e. it is constant on the
orbit GC · a for every a ∈(GC)N. Being continuous, it is then constant on the closure
GC · a. As a consequence, it takes the same value on two orbits whenever their clo-
sures intersect. This motivates the following deﬁnition. Two elements a, b ∈(GC)N
are orbit closure equivalent if there exist c1, . . . , cr ∈(GC)N such that
GC · a ∩GC · c1 ̸= ∅,
GC · c1 ∩GC · c2 ̸= ∅, . . . ,
GC · cr ∩GC · b ̸= ∅.
Clearly, orbit closure equivalence deﬁnes an equivalence relation on (GC)N. Let
(GC)NGC denote the topological quotient.50 By construction, the elements of H C
descend to continuous functions on (GC)NGC.
Second, following [291], we recall how the orbit closure quotient (GC)NGC is
related to the reduced phase space P. Via the polar decomposition isomorphism Φ,
we can view the momentum mapping as a mapping
J : (GC)N →g∗
and we can view P as the quotient of J −1(0) ⊂(GC)N by the action of G. Since G
is compact, GC is linear algebraic. Then, (GC)N is an afﬁne variety in some complex
vector space V , the action of G on (GC)N by diagonal conjugation is the restriction
50The notation is motivated by the fact that the quotient provides a categorical quotient of (GC)N
by GC in the sense of geometric invariant theory [461].

to (GC)N of the mapping
˜
J : V →g∗,
˜
J (v)(A) := 1
2i ⟨v, Av⟩,
where ⟨· , · ⟩is an appropriate G-invariant scalar product on V and A acts on v by
the induced representation of the Lie algebra. In this situation, the level set J −1(0)
has the following properties [361].
1. For all a ∈(GC)N, one has GC · a ∩J −1(0) ̸= ∅.
2. For all a ∈(GC)N, the orbit GC · a is closed iff (GC · a) ∩J −1(0) ̸= ∅.
3. For all a ∈J −1(0), one has (GC · a) ∩J −1(0) = G · a.
Properties 2 and 3 ensure that J −1(0) is what is known in geometric invariant theory
as a Kempf-Ness set. Using properties 1-3, one can prove the following [291].
Theorem 9.6.7 The natural inclusion mapping J −1(0) →(GC)N induces a home-
omorphism P →(GC)NGC.
■
As a consequence, via the homeomorphism of Theorem 9.6.7, the elements of H C
can be interpreted as functions on P. Thus, it makes sense to take the restriction of
such an element to a subset of P.
Deﬁnition 9.6.8 A wave function ϕ ∈H C is said to be localized at the stratum Pτ
if it is orthogonal to all wave functions χ which vanish at Pτ.
Following this concept of localization, as the closed subspace H C
τ
⊂H C consisting
of the wave functions which are localized at the stratum Pτ we obtain the orthogonal
complement of the closed subspace
V C
τ
:= {χ ∈H C : χ↾Pτ = 0} .
It follows that we have an orthogonal decomposition
H C = H C
τ ⊕V C
τ .
Finally, the inverse of the isomorphism Ct maps the subspaces H C
τ to subspaces Hτ
of H G.
Proposition 9.6.9 The assignment of Hτ to τ ∈T is a costratiﬁcation of H G.

tinuous, this implies V C

A Toy Model
In this section, we discuss the example G = SU(2) and N = 1 in some detail, cf.
[328]. This corresponds to the toy model of a lattice consisting of one plaquette,
because here every tree contains three of the four links. Alternatively, it may be
viewed as a Hamiltonian SU(2)-gauge theory on a circle after reduction by the
pointed gauge group.
First, we determine the stratiﬁcation of the reduced phase space
P = J −1(0)/SU(2) .
As already noted, in the case N = 1, the condition J (g, Y) = 0 implies that up to
conjugacy, g and Y may be chosen from a maximal toral subgroup T ⊂SU(2) and
the corresponding Lie subalgebra t ⊂su(2), respectively. Hence, P ∼= (T × t)W,
where W = NSU(2)(T )/T is the Weyl group of SU(2). If we choose T and t to
consist of the diagonal matrices in SU(2) and su(2), respectively, W acts on T × t
by simultaneous permutation of the entries. The stabilizer of (x, Y) ∈T × t is W
in case (x, Y) = (±1, 0) and trivial otherwise. Hence, there are two orbit types and
three orbit type connected components, given by P+ consisting of (the class of)
(1, 0), P−consisting of (the class of) (−1, 0), and P1 consisting of all the rest.
Clearly, P1 is the principal stratum. Hence, in this simple example, there are only
two secondary strata and these strata consist of isolated points. The stratiﬁed space
P is depicted in Fig.9.1. This space is known as the canoe.
Next, we choose bases in the relevant Hilbert spaces and determine the
Segal-Bargmann transformation. The Schrödinger Hilbert space is H = L2(G)G,
the subspace of L2(G) consisting of the functions which are invariant under inner
automorphisms. The holomorphic Hilbert space is H C = H L2(GC)G, the subspace
of H L2(GC) consisting of the functions which are invariant under conjugation by
elements of G. Let χn denote the character of the irreducible representation of G of
spin n/2. Then, the analytic continuation χC
n is the character of the corresponding
representation of GC = SL(2, C). To ﬁnd explicit formulae, recall that the represen-
tation dπn of spin n/2 of su(2) reads
dπn

9.6.3 and Proposition 9.6.4, then the χC
n form an orthogonal basis in H C.
Next, we determine the Segal-Bargmann transform of χn and the eigenvalues of
the Laplacian. Since every invariant scalar product on su(2) is proportional to the
(negative deﬁnite) trace form, we have
|Y|2 = −1

Relative to the invariant scalar product on t∗induced by that on t, the two roots α
and −α have norm |α|2 = 4β2. Hence |δ|2 = β2 and |λn + δ|2 = β2(n + 1)2. As a
result,
cℏ,n = (ℏπ)3/2eℏβ2(n+1)2 .

The formula for the eigenvalues ζn follows from (9.6.12).

Now, we are in a position to determine the subspaces H± ⊂H associated with
the secondary strata P±. By deﬁnition, under the Segal-Bargmann transformation
they are mapped to the orthogonal complements of the subspaces V C
± of functions
vanishing on P±.
Lemma 9.7.2 The subspaces V C
+ and V C
−are spanned by, respectively,
χC

(9.7.6)
Proof Under the identiﬁcation P = J −1(0)/SU(2) = (T × t)/W = TC/W, the
strata P± correspond to the isolated points ±1 in TC. Hence, V C
± ⊂H C is deﬁned
by the condition ψ(±1) = 0. By (9.7.2), we have
χC
n (±1) = (±1)n(n + 1) .
Hence, all the functions given in (9.7.5) belong to V C
+ and all the functions given in
(9.7.6) belong to V C
−. Linear independence is obvious. That the system (9.7.5) spans
V C
+ follows by observing that, together with χC
0 , it spans H C. Similarly, the system
(9.7.6) spans V C
−, because together with χC
1 , it spans H C as well.
■
To determine H±, we turn back to H and take the orthogonal complement there.
Up to a factor, under the inverse of the Segal-Bargmann transformation, the basis
elements (9.7.5) and (9.7.6) are mapped, respectively, to
eℏβ2(n+1)2/2χn −(n + 1)eℏβ2/2χ0 ,
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
(9.7.7)
eℏβ2(n+1)2/2χn −n + 1

e2ℏβ2χ1 ,
n = 0, 2, 3, . . . .

Proposition 9.7.3 The subspaces H± have dimension 1. They are spanned by the
normalized vectors

Proof Clearly, the series on the right hand side converges and its limit is normalized.
Both the vector ϕ+ together with the system (9.7.7) and the vector ϕ−together with
the system (9.7.8) span L2(G)G. Finally, a straightforward computation shows that
ϕ+ is orthogonal to all the vectors in (9.7.7) and ϕ−is orthogonal to all the vectors
in (9.7.8).

Remark 9.7.4
1. The transition probability |⟨ϕ+, ϕ−⟩|2 between the states deﬁned by ϕ+ and ϕ−
has the physical interpretation of a tunneling probability between the strata P+
and P−. It can be expressed in terms of the θ-constant θ3(Q) = ∞

⟨ϕ+, ϕ−⟩= −θ′

Figure9.2 shows |⟨ϕ+, ϕ−⟩|2 as a function of the combined constant ℏβ2. As one
would expect, the tunneling probability vanishes in the semiclassical limit ℏ→0.
2. According to (9.6.6) and (9.7.4), the heat kernel on G = SU(2) is given by
ρt =
∞

n=0
(n + 1)e−tβ2n(n+2)/2χn .
Comparison with (9.7.9) shows that ρℏ= eℏβ2 Nϕ+. More generally, using the
analytic continuation of ρt to GC, for every g ∈GC, we can deﬁne a function
ϕ(t)
g on GC = SL(2, C) by ϕ(t)
g (h) := ρt(gh−1), for any h ∈GC. Then,
Cℏ(ϕ±) = e−ℏβ2
N
ϕ(ℏ)
±1 .
According to [278], the functions ϕ(ℏ)
g
admit an interpretation as coherent states
on GC. Within the bounds imposed by the uncertainty relation, they are optimally
localized at the phase space point g. Thus, the states spanning H± are optimally
localized at the points forming the corresponding strata.
Expressing the transition probability |⟨ϕ+, ϕ−⟩|2 in terms of the coherent states
ϕ(ℏ)
1
and ϕ(ℏ)
−1, we obtain the identity
|⟨ϕ+, ϕ−⟩|2 =

general situations in a series of papers by Thiemann and collaborators [619].

Next, we discuss the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian (9.5.31) for the lattice
at hand and determine the transition probabilities between the energy eigenstates
and the states ψ± associated with the strata. If for simplicity we put a = 1, the

where Δ is the Laplacian on SU(2) and κ denotes the coupling constant. A core is

For κ →∞, that is, in the strong coupling limit, the eigenvalue problem reduces
to that of the Laplacian. Hence, in this case, according to (9.7.4), H has the non-
degenerate eigenvalues

The subspace { ˜ψ : ψ ∈C∞(G)G} ⊂L2[0, π] is a core for the transformed

˜H = −ℏ2κ2β2

One can check that ˜H is still symmetric on the larger subspace
{ ˜ψ ∈L2[0, π] : ˜ψ(0) = ˜ψ(π) = 0} ,
(9.7.13)
so we may take the latter as a core (Exercise 9.7.3).
Now, consider the stationary Schrödinger equation ˜H ˜ψ = E ˜ψ. Dividing by the
factor −ℏ2κ2β2/2 and substituting y = (x −π)/2, we obtain the Mathieu equation
f ′′(y) + (a −2q cos(2y)) f (y) = 0

and with f being a Whitney smooth function on the interval [−π/2, 0] satisfying
the boundary conditions
f (−π/2) = f (0) = 0 .
(9.7.16)
For the theory of the Mathieu equation and its solutions, the Mathieu functions,
we refer to [22, 436, 440].52 All we need here is that for certain characteristic val-
ues of the parameter a, depending analytically on q and usually being denoted by
b2n+2(q), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , solutions satisfying (9.7.16) exist. Given a = b2n+2(q),
the corresponding solution is unique up to a complex factor and can be chosen to be
real-valued. It is usually denoted by se2n+2(y; q), where 'se' stands for 'sine elliptic'.
For given q ≥0, deﬁne functions ˜χ(q)
n

˜χ(q)
n (x) = (−1)n+1*
2/π se2n+2

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Since se2n+2(y; 0) = sin((2n + 2)y), the factor (−1)n+1 ensures that χ(0)
n
= χn. Us-
ing the results of Sects.20.2 and 20.5 in [4], we obtain the following.
Proposition 9.7.5 The functions ˜χ(q)

The transition probabilities P±
n depend on the parameters ℏ, β2 and κ only via
the combinations ℏβ2 and q = 16/(ℏ2β2κ4). For illustration, they are displayed for
n = 0, . . . , 5 in Fig.9.3 as functions of q for two speciﬁc values of ℏβ2, thus treating
ℏ2β2κ4 and ℏβ2 as independent parameters.53
We observe that the transition probability P+

52Mathieu functions have already appeared in Example 9.8.9 of Part 1. Note that the Mathieu
equation also arises as the Schrödinger equation of the quantum planar pendulum, yet with different
boundary conditions [137], see also [13, 52, 519]. For a discussion of the relation between our system

words, for a certain value of the coupling constant, depending on ℏβ2, the state
ϕ+ spanning H+ is very close to the ground state. The two states do not coincide
completely though, because the Fourier coefﬁcients of ϕ+, given by (9.7.9), do not
satisfy the recurrence relations for B2n+2
2k+2 (q), given in [4, Sect.20.2], for none of the
values of q. This observation should be compared with an earlier result of Emmrich
and Römer [185]. These authors considered Schrödinger quantum mechanics on a
double cone and showed that the vacuum state concentrates around the singularity.
Thus, the nongeneric strata seemingly carry information about the spectral measure
of the Hamiltonian of a gauge theory.
Remark 9.7.6
1. One can derive explicit approximate formulae for P±
n in the strong and weak
coupling limit, cf. [328].
2. Let us discuss the extension problem which arises by quantization on the principal
stratum, see also [542] for further details. While naive quantization after reduction
on all of T∗G fails, because of the presence of singularities in P, it can be
carried out on the part of T∗G where regular cotangent bundle reduction applies,
that is, on the submanifold made up by the cotangent bundle of the unreduced
principal stratum G\{±1}. For this submanifold, symplectic reduction leads to
the cotangent bundle of the quotient manifold. In the parameterization of the
quotient of G by inner automorphisms by the closed interval [0, π], this quotient
manifold corresponds to the open interval ]0, π[. Since the parameterization is an
and the quantum planar pendulum, both on classical and quantum level, we refer to Remarks 2.2,
5.2 and 5.4 in [328].

(9.7.17)
on the Hilbert space L2[0, π] having as domain the compactly supported smooth
functions on the open interval ]0, π[. To arrive at a quantum theory of the entire
system, one has to determine the self-adjoint extensions of the operator (9.7.17).
This is the problem studied in [185] where the classical conﬁguration space is a
double cone. When the classical conﬁguration space arises by reduction, as in the
system under consideration, the extension problem can be solved by reduction
after quantization, because this determines the kinetic energy operator uniquely.
This was already observed in [680] in the context of quantization by Rieffel
induction. Indeed, in our situation, up to the shift by a constant which can be
obtained by the metaplectic correction, the ﬁrst term in (9.7.12) deﬁned on the
core (9.7.13) is a self-adjoint extension of (9.7.17). In fact, this is the Friedrichs
extension.

Consider right K-vector spaces with K = R, C or H. We use the obvious subﬁeld
embeddings R ⊂C and R ⊂H as well as the embedding
C →H ,
x + iy →x1 + yi .
First,we discuss ﬁeld restriction. For a K-vector space V and a subﬁeld L ⊂K,
we let VL denote the L-vector space obtained from V by ﬁeld restriction, that is, by
restricting multiplication by scalars to the subﬁeld L. The same notation will be used
for vector bundles. One has
dim(VL) = dim(V) dimL(K)
and a similar relation between the ranks in the case of vector bundles. Note that in
the case K = H and L = C, scalars keep multiplying from the right. That is, scalar
multiplication by z ∈C of an element vq, where v ∈V and q ∈H, yields vqz.

Since GL(n, C) and GL(n, H) are connected, their images are contained in the iden-
tity component of GL(2n, R) and GL(4n, R), respectively.

Now, consider vector bundles. Clearly, if h is a Hermitean ﬁbre metric on a complex

on the realiﬁcation ER. If h is a Hermitean ﬁbre metric on a quaternionic vector bundle
E, then (A.10) deﬁnes ﬁbrewise a Hermitean ﬁbre metric hC on the complexiﬁcation
EC.
Lemma A.1 Let (K, L) = (C, R), (H, R) or (H, C) and let E be a K-vector bundle
of rank n over a topological space B endowed with a ﬁbre metric h.

by (A.11).
Proof Point 1 is proved by direct inspection. Point 2 follows from the equation
(u · a)˜ = ˜u · j(a)
for all a ∈U(n) in case K = C or a ∈Sp(n) in case K = H. Here, j denotes the
corresponding embedding in (A.11).
■
Now, we turn to the discussion of ﬁeld extension. Let (L, K) = (R, C), (R, H) or
(C, H) and let V be an L-vector space. Since L is a subﬁeld of K, we can view K
as a vector space over L with scalars acting by multiplication from the left. Since, in
addition, L is commutative, we can form the tensor product of L-vector spaces
VK := V ⊗L K .

762
Appendix A: Field Restriction and Field Extension
For every k′ ∈K, the mapping V × K →VK deﬁned by (v, k) →v ⊗(kk′) is
L-bilinear and hence induces an L-linear endomorphism of VK which maps v ⊗k to
v ⊗(kk′). Thus, letting k′ run through K, we obtain a mapping
VK × K →VK ,
(v ⊗k, k′) →v ⊗(kk′) .
This mapping, taken as the multiplication by scalars on VK, combines with the ad-
ditive structure of VK to a K-linear structure on VK, thus turning VK into a K-vector
space. This vector space is called the complexiﬁcation of V in case (L, K) = (R, C)
and the quaternioniﬁcation of V in case (L, K) = (R, H) or (C, H). Multiplication
by scalars will be written in the form
(v ⊗k)k′ := v ⊗(kk′) ,
k, k′ ∈K .
Clearly, if {ei} is a basis in V, then {ei ⊗1} is a basis in VK. Therefore, VK has the
same dimension as V. Since (vl) ⊗1 = v ⊗l = (v ⊗1)l for all l ∈L and v ∈V, the
mapping
V →VK ,
v →v ⊗1 ,
is L-linear and embeds V into VK as a linear subspace over L. In the case V = Ln, the
vector space VK may be identiﬁed with Kn via the natural isomorphism Ln
K →Kn
deﬁned by (l1, . . . , ln) ⊗k →(l1k, . . . , lnk).
The concept of ﬁeld extension carries over to vector bundles as follows. Given
an L-vector bundle E over a topological space B, by viewing K as above as a left
L-vector space, we can take the tensor product of L-vector bundles
EK := E ⊗L (B × K)
and endow each ﬁbre Eb ⊗L K with the K-linear structure of (Eb)K. Then, for every
local frame e1, . . . , en in E, the local sections e1 ⊗1, . . . , en ⊗1 of EK form a local
frame in EK. Hence, EK is a locally trivial K-vector bundle and it has the same
rank as E. It is called the complexiﬁcation of E in case (L, K) = (R, C) and the
quaternioniﬁcationof E incase(L, K) = (R, H) or (C, H). Thefollowingstatements
have their origin in corresponding statements about vector spaces.
(a) The mapping E →EK deﬁned by e →e ⊗1 is an L-linear vector bundle
morphism and embeds E into EK as a vertical subbundle over L.
(b) Given two complex vector bundles E and E′ over B and B′, respectively, and an
L-vector bundle morphism F : E →E′, there exists a unique K-vector bundle
morphism FK : EK →E′
K such that FK(e ⊗k) = F(e) ⊗k for all e ∈E and
k ∈K. This morphism is referred to as the K-linear extension of F. It projects
to the same mapping B →B′ as F.
(c) Given a real vector bundle E, the mappings

are vertical isomorphisms of real vector bundles. Given a complex vector bundle
E, the mapping
E ⊕E →(EH)C ,
(v, w) →v ⊗1 + w ⊗j ,
is a vertical isomorphism of complex vector bundles. Here, E denotes the com-
plex conjugate vector bundle, cf. Sect. 4.4.
(d) Given a real vector bundle E, the mapping
EC →EC ,
e ⊗z →e ⊗z
(A.12)
is a vertical isomorphism of complex vector bundles.
Finally, we discuss ﬁeld extension of scalar products and Hermitean ﬁbre metrics.
We use the fact that for every scalar product h on an L-vector space V, there exists
a unique scalar product hK on VK such that
hK(v ⊗k, v′ ⊗k′) = k†h(v, v′)k′
for all v, v′ ∈V , k, k′ ∈K .
Accordingly, given a Hermitean ﬁbre metric h on a K-vector bundle E over a topo-

Let us observe the following. It is clear that the L-linear subspace embedding V →
VK given by v →v ⊗1 is isometric with respect to h and hK. In the case V = Ln
with h being the standard scalar product on Ln, one can check that hK corresponds
to the standard scalar product on Kn under the natural isomorphism Ln
K ∼= Kn. It
follows that the L-subalgebra embedding Mn(L) →Mn(K) induced by the inclusion
relation L ⊂K restricts to a Lie subgroup embedding of the corresponding isometry
group. Thus, we obtain Lie subgroup embeddings

The Conformal Group of the 4-Sphere
Consider the embedded submanifold S4 ⊂R5 endowed with the standard metric
g0 obtained by restricting the Euclidean metric ⟨·, ·⟩on R5. In standard coordinates
z0, . . . , z4 of R5 corresponding to the canonical basis {e0, . . . , e4} it is given by
∥z∥2 = 1. First, we show that the stereographic projection mappings yield a confor-
mal identiﬁcation of S4 with H∪{∞}, where H ∼= R4 is endowed with the Euclidean
metric. That is, (S4, g0) is locally conformally ﬂat.
First, recall from Example 1.1.22 that S4 is diffeomorphic to the quaternionic
projective space HP1. Under the natural vector space isomorphism H ∼= R4, this
diffeomorphism is given by
HP1 →S4 ⊂R × H ∼= R5 ,
[(q1, q2)] →z = (∥q1∥2 −∥q2∥2, 2q2q1) . (B.1)
Under this mapping, [(1, 0)] is sent to e0 (north pole), [(0, 1)] is sent to −e0 (south
pole) and the stereographic projection mappings1 take the following form2:
ϕn,s : Un,s = S4 \ {±e0} →H ∼= R4 ,
ϕn(z) := q1q−1
2 ,
ϕs(z) := q2q−1

Appendix B: The Conformal Group of the 4-Sphere
Lemma B.1 The stereographic projection mappings ϕn,s from S4 to the Euclidean
space R4 are conformal. If we choose the orientation of R4 ⊂R5 deﬁned by +e0
and the orientation of S4 ⊂R5 deﬁned by the radial vector ﬁeld pointing outwards,
then ϕs is orientation preserving, whereas ϕn is orientation reversing.
Proof Let X, Y ∈TzS4 ⊂R5, that is, ⟨X, z⟩= 0 = ⟨Y, z⟩. Then,
ϕ′
n,s(X) = (1 ∓z0)X −X0(e0 ∓z)
(1 ∓z0)2
,
and thus
⟨ϕ′
n,s(X), ϕ′
n,s(Y)⟩= ⟨(1 ∓z0)X −X0(e0 ∓z), (1 ∓z0)Y −Y0(e0 ∓z)⟩
(1 ∓z0)4
=
⟨X, Y⟩
(1 ∓z0)2 .
Since 1 ∓z0 =
2
1+∥ϕn,s(z)∥2 and gz(X, Y) = ⟨X, Y⟩, we obtain
gz(X, Y) =
4
(1 + ∥ϕn,s(z)∥2)2 ⟨ϕ′
n,s(X), ϕ′
n,s(Y)⟩.
The second statement is a consequence of the following identity (Exercise B.1) for
the canonical volume forms on R4 and S4, respectively, corresponding to the above
deﬁned orientations:
ϕ∗
n,s (vR4) = ∓
1
(1 ∓z0)4 (vS4)↾Un,s .
(B.3)
■
We conclude that (Us, ϕs) and (Un, ϕn) constitute an oriented atlas of S4 consist-
ing of conformal local charts. One may choose one of the stereographic projection
mappings, say ϕs, and extend it to a diffeomorphism
ϕ : S4 ∼= HP1 →H ∪{∞}
(B.4)
by sending the southpole −e0 to {∞}. This yields a conformal identiﬁcation.
Under this identiﬁcation, the proper (that is, orientation preserving) conformal
group of S4 is given by
C0(S4, [g0]) = SL(2, H)/{±1} .
(B.5)

Appendix B: The Conformal Group of the 4-Sphere
767
Its universal covering group is C0(S4, [g0]) = SL(2, H) . Here, SL(2, H) denotes
the group of (2 × 2)-matrices with quaternionic entries and determinant equal to 1.
We present the algebraic part of the proof of this fact. First, let us recall the deﬁnition
of the determinant: the representation of H on C2 given by

naturally lifts to an injective homomorphism of algebras,
τn : Mn(H) →M2n(C) .
One deﬁnes
detH(g) := det(τn(g)) ,
g ∈GL(n, H) .
(B.6)
Then, one easily checks the following (Exercise B.2):
detH(g) ≥0 ,
detH(gh) = detH(g)detH(h) .
(B.7)
In particular, for n = 2 one has3
detH(g) = det(ad −aca−1b) ,
(B.8)
where g =
a b
c d

, a, b, c, d ∈H. Now, consider the natural left action of SL(2, H)
on H2,
SL(2, H) × H2 →H2 ,
(k, (q1, q2)) →(aq1 + bq2, cq1 + dq2) ,
where k =
a b
c d

∈SL(2, H). Clearly, this action projects onto a left transitive
action of SL(2, H) on HP1 ∼= H ∪{∞},
Ψ : SL(2, H) × HP1 →HP1 ,
Ψk[(q1, q2)] = [(aq1 + bq2, cq1 + dq2)] .
1. Let q1 ̸= 0. Then, denoting x = q2q−1
1 , we obtain
[(aq1 + bq2, cq1 + dq2)] = [(1, (c + dx)(a + bx)−1)] .
2. Let q1 = 0. Under the isomorphism (B.4), this point corresponds to {∞}. For
b ̸= 0, {∞} is sent to [(1, db−1)] and for b = 0, {∞} is a ﬁxed point.
3A priori, the following formula holds for a ̸= 0 only. But, if we declare conjugation by zero to be
the identity, then this formula remains true for a = 0 as well.

Appendix B: The Conformal Group of the 4-Sphere
To summarize, SL(2, H) acts on HP1 ∼= H∪{∞} via fractional linear transformations
(or Möbius transformations4),
x →(c + dx)(a + bx)−1 ,
(B.9)
with the transformation law for {∞} speciﬁed under point 2.5 It is easy to show that
the kernel of this action is {±1} (Exercise B.3). Thus, SL(2, H)/{±1} acts effectively
on HP1. It is also easy to see that its building blocks have the following geometrical
interpretation (Exercise B.4):
1. x →dxa−1 with a ̸= 0 ̸= d:
SO(4)-rotations and dilations,
2. x →x + c:
translations,
3. x →x−1:
proper inversions.
Lemma B.2 The Möbius transformations (B.9) are conformal.
Proof Since the stereographic projection mappings ϕs,n are conformal, it is enough
to show that the mapping (B.9) is conformal with respect to the metric induced by
the quaternionic norm. For x, y ∈H and b ̸= 0, we calculate6

=
∥y −x∥∥
∥a + by∥∥a + bx∥.
For b = 0, the calculation is trivial.
■
To ﬁnish the proof of (B.5) it now remains to show that all conformal transformations
of S4 are given by (B.9). This fact is proven in the literature under various regularity
conditions on the mapping, see e.g. Sect. 15 in [168]. In this complete version, the
above statement is usually referred to as the Liouville Theorem.
4Cf. [517, 518, 670] for an exhaustive discussion.
5The latter also follows from (B.9) by rewriting (c + dx)(a + bx)−1 = (cx−1 + d)(ax−1 + b)−1
and taking the limit x →∞.
6The trick in the calculation below is taken from [670].

Simple Lie Algebras. Root Diagrams
We introduce the basic notions of root theory of simple Lie algebras in a rather
operational spirit. For a presentation of the theory, we refer to [170], [329].
Let L be a complex simple Lie algebra. By deﬁnition, a Cartan subalgebra of L is
a maximal Abelian subalgebra. Given a Cartan subalgebra L0, we may decompose
L into the common eigenspaces of the endomorphisms ad(B) with B ∈L0. The
commoneigenspaces arelabelledbytheeigenvaluefunctionalsα assigningtoB ∈L0
the corresponding eigenvalue α(B). The nonzero eigenvalue functionals are referred
to as the roots of L relative to L0. They form the root system W ⊂L∗
0. Given α ∈W ,
the corresponding common eigenspace Lα has dimension one. It is called the root
subspace of α and its elements are called the root vectors of α. As a result, we obtain
a direct sum decomposition into vector subspaces
L = L0 ⊕α∈W Lα ,
(C.1)
where
[B, eα] = α(B)eα
(C.2)
for all eα ∈Lα and B ∈L0.
The restriction to L0 of the Killing form is negative deﬁnite. Thus, we may use
a negative multiple of it to deﬁne a scalar product ⟨·, ·⟩on L0. The latter induces,
in turn, a scalar product ⟨·, ·⟩∗on L∗
0. We normalize these scalar products by the
requirement
⟨α, α⟩∗= 2
for the longest root α. Via the isomorphism L0 ∼= L∗
0 deﬁned by ⟨·, ·⟩, to every α ∈W
there corresponds an element hα ∈L0, called the Cartan element of α. By deﬁnition,
⟨hα, B⟩= α(B) for all B ∈L0.
Let ℓ= rank(L). A subsystem Π = {α1, . . . , αℓ} ⊂W is called a system of
simple roots if it is a basis in L∗
0 and if for all α ∈W one has α = ± 
i niαi with
non-negative integers ni. According to the sign, one speaks of positive and negative
roots relative to Π. One can show that systems of simple roots exist. Given such

a system, one may choose root vectors eαi ∈Lαi and fαi ∈L−αi, i = 1, . . . , ℓ, so
that the relations
[hαi, hαj] = 0 ,
[hαi, eαj] = Aij eαi ,
[hαi, fαj] = −Aij fαi ,
(C.3)
[eαi, fαj] = −δij hαi ,
⟨eαi, fαj⟩= −δij
hold for all i, j. The matrix
Aij := 2⟨αi, αj⟩∗/⟨αi, αi⟩∗
(C.4)
is called the Cartan matrix. Every positive root can be written as a sum α = αi1 +
. . . + αin in such a way that every partial sum is a root. Then,
ad(eαin ) ◦· · · ◦ad(eαi2 )eαi1 ∈Lα .
An analogous statement holds for the negative roots. Thus, the vectors hαi, eαi and
fαi generate L. In addition, one may choose root vectors eα ∈Lα for the remaining
roots such that for any α, β ∈W one has
[eα, eβ] =

Nα,β eα+β

(C.5)
where qβ,α and rβ,α are the largest non-negative integers such that
α −rβ,αβ, . . . , α + qβ,αβ ∈W .
The Cartan matrix may be represented by a diagram, known as the Dynkin diagram,
as follows. As a matter of fact, the simple roots αi can have at most two different
lengths. In the Dynkin diagram, they are represented by circles, where the circle is
ﬁlled in case αi is short and unﬁlled in case it is long. The circles representing αi
and αj are connected by AijAji edges (no summation). FigureC.1 shows the Dynkin
diagrams for the classical complex simple Lie algebras. Given the Dynkin diagram,
one can reconstruct the Cartan matrix and from the Cartan matrix one can reconstruct
L up to isomorphy.
A semisimple Lie subalgebra L′ of L is called regular if there exists a Cartan
subalgebra L0 of L such that L′ is invariant under ad(B) for all B ∈L0. In this case,
there exists a subspace L′
0 ⊂L0 and a subset W ′ ⊂W such that

Fig. C.2 Root diagrams of the simple Lie algebras Aℓ= sl(ℓ+ 1, C) and Bℓ= so(2ℓ+ 1, C)
In Sect.7.9, we consider the restriction of the adjoint representation of a complex
semisimple Lie algebra L to a regular subalgebra L′ ⊂L and decompose it into
irreducible components. For that purpose, it is convenient to exploit a natural ordering
in the set of positive roots. This allows for extending the Dynkin diagram to a diagram
of the positive roots. The latter can be represented in the form of a triangle whose
upper side coincides with the Dynkin diagram, see [643] for further details. Since
we need the root diagrams for the series Aℓand Bℓonly, we limit our attention to
these series, see Fig.C.2.
In the root diagram of Aℓ, the circle at the intersection of the lines starting from
αi and αj, i ≤j, corresponds to the root α(i, j) = αi + . . . + αj. In the normalization
chosen above,
⟨αi, αj⟩∗=
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩

i = j ,
−1 |i −j| = 1 ,
0
|i −j| ≥2 .
Using this, one can easily calculate the scalar products between all α(i, j), see [643].
In the root diagram of Bℓ, the roots contained in the triangle deﬁned by (α1, αℓ, ι)
have the same form as the roots in the Aℓ-lattice. In the triangle (αℓ, β1, ι), the circle

774
Appendix C: Simple Lie Algebras. Root Diagrams
at the intersection of the lines starting from βi and βj, i ≤j, corresponds to the root
β(i, j) = αi + . . . + αj + 2(αj+1 + . . . + αn) ,
βi = αi + 2(αi+1 + . . . αn) .
As an example, let us consider the decomposition of the restriction of the adjoint
representation of Aℓto the regular subalgebra A2 ⊂Aℓ. This is used in Sect.7.9. By
virtue of (C.3)-(C.5), we obtain the decomposition
Aℓ= A2 ⊕c ⊕
ℓ−2

i=1

pi ⊕¯pi

,
(C.6)
where c is the centralizer of A2 in Aℓand where pi and ¯pi carry the basic representation
of A2. For the calculation of the centralizer, one can use a theorem of Dynkin [170]
which states that the centralizer of a regular semisimple subalgebra h of a semisimple
Lie algebra g is the direct sum of a regular semisimple subalgebra ˜g and a regular
Abelian subalgebra g0, fulﬁlling
rank(g) −rank(h) −rank(˜g) = dim g0 ,
[˜g, g0] = 0 .
(C.7)
In our case, this implies
c = Aℓ−3 ⊕g0 ,
dim g0 = 1 .
(C.8)
In the basis consisting of the Cartan elements hαi, one obtains g0 = C˜B, where
˜B = 2(ℓ−2)
ℓ+ 1

⎝hα1 + 2hα2 + 3hα3 +

ℓ−2

j=4
(ℓ+ 1 −j) hαj

⎠.
Up to a multiplicative constant, this form of ˜B follows from the deﬁnition of the
centralizer and from the second relation in (C.8). The constant is ﬁxed by the re-
quirement ⟨˜B, hα3⟩= 2. It is easy to see that then ⟨˜B, hαi⟩= 0 for all i ̸= 3. In the
root diagram of Aℓin Fig.C.2, the subalgebra A2 corresponds to the small triangle
on the left which is made up by the roots α1, α2 ad α1 + α2 and the subalgebra
Aℓ−3 corresponds to the large triangle on the right which is generated by the roots
α4, . . . , αℓ. The remaining part of the diagram is a rectangle which can be divided
into ℓ−2 lines containing three circles each. The root vectors of the roots in these
lines span the subspaces pi and the root vectors of the corresponding negative roots
span the subspaces pi.
Finally, we stress that the graphical method presented here gives more information
than the mere tables of subalgebras. We do not only get the types and multiplicities
of irreducible representations for the restriction of the adjoint representation to a
subalgebra but also their explicit realization on the root vectors. This information is
needed for calculating the scalar ﬁeld potentials in Sect.7.9.

ζ-Function Regularization
Let P be a symmetric positive operator on Rn and let p be the associated quadratic
form,
p(x) := ⟨x, Px⟩,
x ∈Rn ,
where ⟨·, ·⟩is the Euclidean scalar product. Recall the Gaussian integral

Invariousbranchesofmathematicsandphysics,onewishestogeneralizethisformula
to the case of operators on inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. For that purpose, a
regularization method for the determinant is needed. Below, we explain the simplest
and most convenient one.
Let P be a symmetric, positive operator with a discrete spectrum on the inﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space H . Then, the ζ-function associated with P is deﬁned
as
ζP(z) =

(D.1)
where λk are the nonzero eigenvalues of P. Clearly, a priori, this formula makes only
sense for values of z for which the above series converges. For other values, ζ(z)
is deﬁned by analytic continuation, see [581] for details. If ζ(z) can be analytically
continued to z = 0, then ζ ′
P(0) is well deﬁned and we can put

and, thus, ζ ′
P(0) = −∞
k=1 ln(λk). This also shows that (D.2) reduces to the ordinary
deﬁnition of the determinant in the ﬁnite-dimensional case.
One important class of operators for which the above regularization works is the
class of elliptic operators of order r on an n-dimensional compact manifold. Then,
the series (D.1) converges for Re(z) > n
r and ζ(z) may be analytically continued to
a meromorphic function of z having no singularity at the origin.
The above result generalizes to the case when P is not necessarily positive, but
is invertible and has a positive deﬁnite symbol. Then, all but a ﬁnite number of
eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λl lie in some cone about the positive axis and, for k > l, the
quantities λ−z

If P has zero modes, then, roughly speaking, one has to restrict the domain of de-

K-Theory and Index Bundles
K-theory is a (generalized) cohomology theory for vector bundles deﬁned as follows,
see [29, 288, 335]. Let X be a compact topological space7 and let V(X) be the set of
isomorphism classes of complex vector bundles over X. Clearly, the set V(X) is an
Abelian semigroup with respect to the operation of taking the direct sum. It has a zero
element given by the zero-dimensional bundle. Let F(X) be the free Abelian group
generated by V(X) and let E(X) be the subgroup of F(X) generated by elements of
the form
V + W −(V ⊕W) .
(E.1)
Then, we deﬁne the K-group (or Grothendieck group) of X by
K(X) := F(X)/E(X) .
(E.2)
By construction, K(X) is an Abelian group and the elements of K(X) are equivalence
classes8 fulﬁlling [V] + [W] = [V ⊕W]. Clearly, any element ξ ∈K(X) may be
represented as a linear combination with integer coefﬁcients and, thus,
ξ =

showing that any element of K(X) may be represented as the difference of two
elements represented by vector bundles. Using the fact that X is compact, one of the
two bundles W1 and W2 may be assumed to be trivial. Indeed, it can be shown that
under this assumption, there exists a bundle W3 such that W2 ⊕W3 is trivial. This
implies
[W1 ⊕W3] −[W2 ⊕W3] = [W1] −[W2] .
Next, we note that two bundles V1 and V2 deﬁne the same element in K(X) iff there
exists a trivial bundle N such that
V1 ⊕N = V2 ⊕N .
(E.3)
This condition is referred to as stable equivalence of the vector bundles V1 and
V2. Clearly, if (E.3) holds, then (E.1) implies [V1] + [N] = [V2] + [N] and, thus
[V1] = [V2]. The proof of the converse statement is a simple exercise which we leave
to the reader.
Finally, we endow K(X) with a natural ring structure:
[V] · [W] := [V ⊗W] .
(E.4)
It is easy to show that for homotopy equivalent spaces X and Y the rings K(X) and
K(Y) are isomorphic.
Recall from Sect.4.7 that the Chern character ch(V) of a vector bundle V has the
following properties:
ch(V ⊕W) = ch(V) + ch(W) ,
ch(V ⊗W) = ch(V) · ch(W) .
Thus, it extends uniquely to a homomorphism of rings:
ch : K(X) →H∗
Q(X) ,
ch([V]) := ch(V) .
(E.5)
Now, consider the following setting relevant for the study of families of Fredholm
operators. We formulate it in the context of Dirac operators as needed in the Family
Index Theorem.
1. Let π : M →Y be a ﬁbre bundle endowed with a ﬁbre metric on the canonical
vertical distribution VM and a connection, that is, a splitting of TM into VM and
a complementary horizontal distribution.
2. Let E = {Ey} be a family of Dirac bundles over My := π−1(y), y ∈Y.
Let V and W be complex vector bundles over Y and denote Vy := V↾My, Wy := W↾My.
Let P = {Py} be a family of Fredholm operators over Y, that is, for every y ∈Y,
Py : L2(Vy) →L2(Wy)

Appendix E: K-Theory and Index Bundles
779
is a Fredholm operator. If the subspaces ker(Py) and coker(Py) have constant dimen-
sion and thus combine to vector bundles over Y, the index bundle of P is the element
of K(Y) deﬁned by
Ind(P) := [ker(P)] −[coker(P)] .
(E.6)
In the general case, where the dimensions of ker(Py) and coker(Py) may jump, the
index bundle is deﬁned as follows. Let y0 ∈Y. Then,
dim ker(Py0) ≥dim ker(Py) ,
for y sufﬁciently close to y0. That is, dim ker is semi-continuous. The same is true for
dim coker. In fact, one can prove that their difference remains constant. The basic
idea for proving this is the following.9 Let P : H →H be a family of Fredholm
operators, let e0, e1, . . . be an orthonormal basis of H and let Hn ⊂H be the subspace
spanned by the vectors {ei} with i ≥n. Let p(n) be the orthogonal projector10 onto
the Hilbert subspace Hn. Deﬁne
P(n) := p(n) ◦P .
Using the compactness of Y, one can prove that there exists a (sufﬁciently large)
number n such that im

= Hn, for all y, y′ ∈Y, and
dim ker

P(n)


P(n)


.
Thus, one can deﬁne
Ind(P) := Ind

P(n)
.
(E.7)
Finally, one proves that this quantity is independent of n and of the choice of the basis.
This construction extends to Fredholm operators acting between different Hilbert
spaces. As in the case of the index of a single operator, one proves that Ind(P) is a
homotopy invariant.
9See [29] or [83] for a pedagogical presentation.
10This is a self-adjoint Fredholm operator. Thus, it has index 0.

There is a huge literature on this subject starting from the classical paper by Quillen
[525], see [72, 79, 80, 210, 211, 593] and further references therein.
To start with, let V and W be ﬁnite-dimensional complex vector spaces with
dim V = dim W = n and let P : V →W be a homomorphism. Consider the
complex lines
Det(V) :=  nV ,
Det(W) :=  nW .
The determinant line of P is deﬁned by
Det(P) := Det(V ∗) ⊗Det(W) ,
(F.1)
and the Quillen determinant det(P) ∈Det(P) is deﬁned as
det(P) := e∗
1 ∧. . . ∧e∗
n ⊗( nP)(e1 ∧. . . ∧en) ,
(F.2)
where {ek} is any basis in V and {e∗
k} is its dual. For V = W, the determinant deﬁned
by (F.2) coincides with the classical determinant of the endomorphism P ∈End(V),
because in this case we have a natural isomorphism
Det(V ∗) ⊗Det(V) →C
(F.3)
induced by the canonical pairing Det(V ∗) × Det(V) →C. The latter implies the
identity
( nP)(e1 ∧. . . ∧en) = det(P) e1 ∧. . . ∧en .
The canonical isomorphism (F.3) also implies the canonical isomorphism
Det(P ◦Q) ∼= Det(P) ⊗Det(Q) ,
(F.4)
for P ∈Hom(V, W) and Q ∈Hom(U, V). Clearly, det(P) vanishes if P has a
nontrivial kernel and is nonzero otherwise. Using the exact sequence

Appendix F: Determinant Line Bundles
0 →ker(P) →V
P→W →coker(P) →0
and the above multiplicative property, we obtain a natural isomorphism
Det(V ∗) ⊗Det(W) ∼= (Det ker(P))∗⊗(Det coker(P)) .
(F.5)
Next, consider a parameter space Y, vector bundles V and W over Y and a vertical
vector bundle morphism P : V →W. The latter gives rise to a family of homomor-
phisms
Py : Vy →Wy
varying smoothly with y ∈B. Then, the above construction yields the complex line
Det(Py) := Det(V ∗
y ) ⊗Det(Wy) for every y ∈B, that is, we obtain a complex line
bundle
π : Det(P) →Y ,
(F.6)
which will be referred to as the determinant line bundle of P. Correspondingly,
the determinants det(Py) combine to a section det(P) in Det(P). In view of (F.5),
it is tempting to generalize the above constructions to Fredholm operators acting
between inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, cf. Deﬁnition 5.7.8. In that case, the
ﬁbres of Det(P) are deﬁned by the right hand side of (F.5).11 Clearly, in general,
the dimensions of ker(P) and coker(P) may jump, so that one has to show that
these ﬁbres piece together to form a smooth vector bundle. This is done in terms of
K-theory over Y, see Appendix E. Let ξ ∈K(Y). One deﬁnes
Det(ξ) := (DetV)∗⊗(DetW) ,
where [V] −[W] is any representative of ξ. It is easy to show that the line bundle
Det(ξ) is independent of the choice of the representative in K(Y). Thus, by (F.5), for
a family P of Fredholm operators the corresponding element of K(Y) is the index
bundle
Ind(P) = [ker(P)] −[coker(P)] ,
and one deﬁnes
Det(P) := Det(Ind(P)) .
(F.7)
That is, the determinant bundle of P is the top exterior power of the index bundle. It
can be shown, see Proposition 3.42 in [83] for a detailed proof, that the set

783
can be taken as a standard representative of the isomorphism class Det(P). This
shows, in particular, that the deﬁnition (F.7) boils down to (F.6) in the ﬁnite-
dimensional case. Generalizing the results of Quillen [525]12 it has been shown
by Bismut and Freed [79] that, for families of twisted Dirac operators, there is a
canonical section det(P) of Det(P) over components of Y where P has index zero.
Over the connected components where the index is nonzero, det(P) = 0 by deﬁni-
tion. The section det(P) is referred to as the Quillen determinant of the family P. If
Det(P) is trivial, then there exists a non-vanishing section σ : Y →Det(P) and we
may represent det(P) by an ordinary C-valued function detC(P) on Y via
detC(P)(y) := det(Py)
σ(y)
.
For a global section σ to exist, the ﬁrst Chern class c1(Det(P)) ∈H2
Z(Y) must
vanish. This cohomology class can be calculated using the Atiyah-Singer Family
Index Theorem, see Remark 5.8.16. In general, Det(P) is nontrivial leading e.g. to
anomalies in gauge theories, see Sect.9.3.
Moreover, generalizing results of Quillen, Bismut and Freed proved that Det(P)
carries a natural metric and a connection. Clearly, the curvature of the latter may
be used to explicitly calculate the ﬁrst Chern class of Det(P). We describe these
structures in some detail13: let π : M →Y be a ﬁbration of manifolds endowed with
the structure described in Remark 5.8.16 and let E = S ⊗E be a vector bundle over
M also endowed with the structure described there. Then, we have a family of Dirac
operators {Dy} over Y which, according to the grading of E , splits into two families
D±
y : H±
y →H∓
y , where H±
y are appropriate Hilbert spaces of sections of E ±
y . The
spaces H±
y ﬁt together to form a continuous Hilbert bundle H →Y. The square of
D is, pointwise on Y, given by
D2 =
D−D+
0
0
D+D−

and, by Theorem 5.7.17, D2 is a family of Fredholm operators with index zero.
Moreover, D2 is non-negative and, by Proposition 5.7.11, it has a discrete spectrum.
The same is true for D−D+ and D+D−, respectively. Now, take P = D+ and consider
its determinant bundle Det(D+), which is deﬁned by (F.7).
First, we give a more explicit description of Det(D+). This substantiates the
remark after deﬁnition (F.7) for the case under consideration. Let a be a positive real
number and let Ua ⊂Y be the subset on which a is not an eigenvalue of D−D+.14
Let H±
a be the sum of eigenspaces corresponding to eigenvalues less than a. Clearly,
the vector spaces H±
a are ﬁnite-dimensional and, by elliptic regularity, they consist
of smooth ﬁelds. Since the spectrum of D−D+ is discrete, the sets Ua form an open
12Quillen considered the case of Cauchy-Riemann operators over a Riemann surface.
13Our presentation is along the lines of Freed [211].
14For simplicity of notation, we omit the index y.

cover of Y. Moreover, it can be shown, see e.g. Sect.9.2 in [72], that the spaces H±
a
ﬁt together to smooth ﬁnite-dimensional vector bundles of locally constant rank over
Ua. Thus, we can deﬁne a line bundle L a →Ua by
L a := Det

.
By the isomorphism (F.5), its ﬁbres may be viewed as
L a
y ∼= Det ker(D+
y )∗⊗Det ker(D−
y ) .
Clearly, for b > a, we have a decomposition H±
b = H±
a ⊕H±
(a,b) over the open set
Ua ∩Ub. This implies L b ∼= L a ⊗L (a,b), where

and, thus, a nonzero section of L (a,b). Using this isomorphism, we can deﬁne a

Over connected components where the index of D+ vanishes, one has dim

via the isomorphism (F.8). Putting
det(D+) = 0 over components where the index is different from zero, we obtain a
global section det(D+) of Det(D+) which is called the Quillen determinant.
Next, we construct the Quillen metric on L . For any a > 0, the L2-metric on
H± induces ﬁbre metrics on the subbundles H±
a . Thus, by linear algebra, we obtain
a ﬁbre metric ga on L a. By (F.8), for b > a, we have
gb = ga ∥D+
(a,b) ∥2= ga "

Now, by the properties of D−D+, we can apply the ζ-function regularization to its
determinant, see Appendix D. By (D.2) and (D.3),

Thus, if we put

(F.9)
then ˆga and ˆgb coincide on Ua ∩Ub. Thus, the ﬁbre metrics ˆga patch together to yield
a ﬁbre metric ˆg which is referred to as the Quillen metric.
Finally, we outline the construction of the connection, see [72, 79] or [211] for
details. The connection ∇on E introduced at the beginning clearly induces con-
nections on the smooth bundles H±
a →Ua which are unitary with respect to the
restricted ﬁbre metrics. Again, by linear algebra, we have induced connections ∇a
on L a which are unitary with respect to ga. For b > a, via the isomorphism (F.8),
we have

Now, one proceeds as in the case of the metric, deﬁning

(F.10)
where trζ

is the ζ-function regularization of the trace [211].
By an obvious additivity property of the regularized traces, ˆ∇a and ˆ∇b agree on
Ua ∩Ub. Thus, these connections patch together to a unitary connection ∇L on L .

Appendix G
Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces
Let A be an Abelian group and let n be a positive integer. A pathwise connected CW-
complex X is called an Eilenberg-MacLane space of type K(A, n) iff πn(X) = A and
πi(X) = 0 for i ̸= n. Eilenberg-MacLane spaces exist for any choice of A and n and
are unique up to homotopy equivalence.15 The simplest example of an Eilenberg-
MacLane space is the 1-sphere S1, which is of type K(Z, 1). Note that Eilenberg-
MacLane spaces are, apart from very special examples, inﬁnite dimensional.
Assume A to be commutative also in the case n = 1. Due to the Universal Coefﬁ-
cient Theorem, Hom (Hn(K(A, n)), A) is isomorphic to a subgroup of Hn
A(K(A, n)).
Due to the Hurewicz Theorem, Hn(K(A, n)) ∼= πn(K(A, n)) = A. It follows that
Hn
A(K(A, n)) contains elements which correspond to isomorphisms
Hn(K(A, n)) →A .
Such elements are called characteristic. If γ ∈Hn
A(K(A, n)) is characteristic, then
for any CW-complex X, the mapping
[X, K(A, n)] →Hn
A(X) ,
f →f ∗γ ,
(G.1)
is a bijection [104, Sect. VII.12]. In this sense, Eilenberg-MacLane spaces provide
a link between homotopy and cohomology.
Let us construct models for the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K(Z, 2) and K(Zg, 1)
and derive the integer-valued cohomology of these spaces. Consider the natural free
action of U(1) on the sphere S∞which is induced from the natural action of U(1) on
S2n−1 ⊂Cn. The orbit space of this action is the inﬁnite complex projective space
CP∞. Moreover, by viewing Zg as a subgroup of U(1), this action gives rise to a
natural free action of Zg on S∞. The orbit space of the latter is the inﬁnite lens space
L∞
g . Thus, one has the principal bundles
15In case n = 1, an Eilenberg-MacLane space exists for any group.

proofs of Theorems 4.8.1 and 4.8.3.
